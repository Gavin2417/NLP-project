      "Every October in Isfahan after harvesting the rice farms, farmers burn the rice residues (straw\n",
      "and stubble) to prevent the growth of insect larvae. The serial burning in the area lasts for a few\n",

      "in the villages, close to Isfahan suburbs, which potentially can injure the respiratory tract of the\n",

To assess respiratory effects of this smoke-induced air pollution, a cross-\\nsectional study has been conducted in three randomly selected villages of Isfahan rural areas. A physician-\\nadministered health questionnaire was completed for 433 male and 561 female villagers aged 1–80 years,\\nfollowed by physical examinations and spirometry in symptomatic cases, before and after a rice burning\\nepisode in October 2000. Total particulate and respirable particulate maters (PM10) was doubled during\\nburning episode. Prevalence rates for respiratory symptoms before smoke were: recent asthma attacks\\n(7.7%), using asthma medications (3%), sleep disturbed by dyspnea and cough (7.4%), exercise-induced\\ncough (13.3%), which increased to 9.5, 7.1, 9.3 and 17%, respectively. Mean initial values (as percent of\\nprediction) for; FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, and FEF25–75 were: 85.9 ± 22.7, 81.7 ±8, 86.2 ±26.2 and\\n60 ± 26.4, respectively. The mentioned values decreased to to 83.2 ± 19.5, 76.5 ± 10.3, 85.5 ± 21.1 and\\n54.3 ± 26.4, respectively. All of the clinical and spirometric changes were statistically significant. Study\\nfindings suggest increased respiratory morbidity associated with rice burning episodes among all people\\nliving in the area.\\nKeywords: Air-pollution; rice; farm; burning; burn; respiratory; symptom; respiratory-health.\\nIntroduction\\nAcute smoke inhalation as a result of fires is a major problem in urban areas (American\\nAcademy of Pediatrics 2000) and has been well studied during the last two decades. Acute\\nexposure to heat, particulate matter (soot), and gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen\\ncyanide can result in respiratory tract burning, asphyxia, and poisoning (Haponic 1993). Chronic\\nexposure to air pollution, especially in larger cities, which is usually related to the internal\\ncombustion engine (Steerenberg et al. 2001) is also known, and its deleterious effects on the\\ntracheobronchial tree and resultant disorders have been frequently studied all over the world.\\nSevere structural and functional impairments both in the upper (Caldern-Garcidueas et al. 2001)\\nand lower (Tzankis et al. 2001) respiratory tract are recorded in those exposed to air pollution.126\\nGolshan et al.\\nBoth short-term (Schindler et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2000), and long-term (Mukae et al. 2001;\\nPauwels et al. 2001) exposures can induce clinical and/or functional respiratory impairments.\\nHowever, subacute smoke inhalation, which usually happens to those living in the neighborhood\\nof fires, not close enough to be grossly injured, have been seldom discussed (McCurdy et al.\\n1996; Jacobs et al. 1997; Long et al. 1998).\\nEvery October in Isfahan after harvesting the rice farms, farmers burn the rice residues (straw\\nand stubble) to prevent the growth of insect larvae. The serial burning in the area lasts for a few\\nweeks. At these times, a thick cloud of smoke covers the fields and households of a large area\\nin the villages, close to Isfahan suburbs, which potentially can injure the respiratory tract of the\\nhealthy inhabitants, and more obviously aggravate the pre-existing respiratory disorders.\\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the respiratory health status of the inhabitants of the\\nvillages of the rice farms before and after burning the rice residues, to elucidate the possible\\nrespiratory risk of this kind of sub-acute smoke inhalation.\\nSubjects and methods\\nThe Committee for Medical Ethics at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the\\nprotocols and methods.\\nAssuming a 5% prevalence rate of airways diseases in the population, 680 people residing in\\nthe area were estimated to be sufficient for the study. Three of the 78 villages found in the map\\nof the area were randomly selected for the study. All people living in these three villages were\\nconsidered to be enrolled in the study. When these three villages were visited, the actual total\\npopulation was 1,127 individuals who were all included in the group.\\nA four-step approach was used for the survey. For the first step, four interns of Isfahan\\nMedical School attended the villages, visited all houses, and asked all people living in the\\nhouses to come to local public health office for a free medical interview and physical\\nexaminations. Since many of the family members may not have been home at first visit, they\\nrepeated the visits on several occasions and at different times to see all members. The medical\\ninterview and physical examinations were performed by interns. To make uniform interviews\\nand medical recordings the interns used a popular respiratory questionnaire (Fishman et al.\\n1998) as the backbone of the interview.\\nFor the second step, those participants complaining of respiratory symptoms, and/or having\\nevidence of airway diseases other than recent colds, were referred to the pulmonary clinic of St.\\nZahra Medical Center for a free visit with a pulmonolgist and a routine spirometry if the subject\\nwas co-operative enough to perform the standard maneuvers. At this second stage, 134 subjects\\nwere invited.\\nSpirometric parameters that were recorded for comparisons included: forced vital capacity\\n(FVC), forced expiratory flow in the first second of expiration (FEV1), the ratio of FVC/FEV1,\\npeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and mean expiratory flow rate at middle half of expiration\\n(FEF 25–75).\\nOne hundred and six cases completed the second stage. The response rate for the second stage\\nwas 79%.\\nSteps one and two were completed during August and September 2000.\\nThe amount of air-suspended particulate maters (PM10) in 14 randomly selected outdoor loci\\nin the area were measured, both before and a few weeks later, during the active phase of burning\\nprocess. PM10 dust measurements were performed using Teflon filters of 37 mm diameter and\\n1 mm pore size, and three pieces cassette holder connected to a personal sampling pump (SKC,Respiratory effects of farm burning\\n127\\nmodel 224-PXR3) operating at a flow rate of 1.5 l/min. Respirable dust samples were collected\\nusing a 10-mm Dorr-olive cyclone on series with 37-mm Teflon filters and the above pump at\\na flow rate of 1.7 l/min. The mass of dust in all samples was determined gravimetrically.\\nOne week after completion of the latest burns, all of the procedures of the first two steps were\\nrepeated to complete the study.\\nIn the fourth step, all of the stage two cases and also newly symptomatic persons were invited\\nfor interview and spirometry. However, pulmonary function test or auscultation comparisons were\\napplicable only in those with a set of two spirometries and/or two physical examinations.\\nBroncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in one patient with cough and hemoptysis\\nafter a burn episode, which showed a mild increase in cell population of the lavage fluid with\\n26% lymphocytes and 8% neutrophils.\\nThe findings were collected in a database and analyzed by the statistical package for the social\\nsciences (SPSS for Windows, ver 10.05, SPSS Chicago, IL). Dependent samples t-test was used\\nto compare nominal or categorical variables. Numerical variables were compared using compare\\nmeans of the package.\\nMultivariate analysis was used to determine the association of post-pollution symptoms with\\nprevious histories of respiratory illnesses and also air pollution.\\nResults\\nOf the initially invited 1,127 inhabitants of the area, 994 (88.2%) accepted enrolment in the\\nstudy. The major reason for refusal was having no time to come to the clinic.\\nThe final subjects who successfully completed the first stage of the study comprised 561\\nfemale and \\n433 \\nmale \\nsubjects, \\nranging \\nin \\nage \\nfrom \\n1month \\nto \\n80 \\nyears\\n(Mean ± SD = 25.2 ± 17.5). The data available from the initial, phase one interview suggested\\nthat a higher proportion of non-responders (n = 105/133) were male. Response rates for male and\\nfemales in first phase were 80.5 and 95.2%, respectively.\\nIn the second stage, the 28 non-responders were generally less symptomatic (as judged by the\\ninitial phase one interview) than were responders. For example, the prevalence of wheeze or\\nwhistle in the chest in the last 12 months was 11.3% in the non-responders in comparison with\\n42.3% in the responders (P < 0.0001).\\nTable 1.

Unfortunately many of the recorded men’s\\nextra job titles were poorly defined and could not disclose the possible pulmonary risks. So they\\nwere not used for risk estimations.\\nThe frequency of respiratory disorders and related symptoms in stages 1 and 2, and changes\\nobserved after burning of the residues (stages 3 and 4) are summarized in Table 2.\\nIn the second stage, only 79 of the 134 invited cases (58.9%) underwent pulmonary function\\ntesting, others (mostly young children) were unable to perform satisfactory forced vital capacity\\nTable 2.

Fortunately all of these 79 were able to complete the later two stages, and fairly\\nanalyzable data were collected.\\nThe main parameters of spirometric recordings of the 79 cases (Mean ±SD) before and after\\nburning the residues are summarized in Table 3.\\nMost of the new sufferers of dyspneal attacks, and night dyspnea and/or cough, as recorded\\nin stages 3 and 4 of the study, had previous histories of similar conditions; however, two toddlers\\nexperienced wheezy respiratory illness for the first time in life in these smoke exposure days.\\nIn multivariate analysis, recent wheezy dyspneal attacks and night sleep disturbance due to\\nrespiratory symptoms after burning episode were significantly associated with previous histories\\nof: cigarette smoking (P < 0.01), chronic bronchitis (P < 0.05), asthma (P = 0.007) or related\\nsymptoms (P < 0.01–0.001).\\nThe results of particulate matter (PM10) measurements are included in Table 4.\\nDiscussion\\nSmoke inhalation is an important cause of acute lung injury in humans and is associated with\\na high mortality rate (Laffon et al. 1999). Smoke inhalation affects both pulmonary endothelial\\nand epithelial barriers (Laffon et al. 1999).\\nA large number of the lower-molecular weight constituents of smoke are toxic to the\\nbronchial mucosa and alveoli because of their physical and/or chemical properties, or their\\nability to form free radicals. Examples include ammonia, aldehydes, chlorine, hydrogen\\nchloride, SO2, NO, NO2, phosgene and many other known or even unknown agents (Haponic\\net al. 1988). The smoke constituents when inhaled in sufficient concentrations tend to produce\\nacute neutrophilic airway inflammation associated with symptoms consisting of cough,\\nbronchorrhea, dyspnea and wheezing (Laffon et al. 1999), the symptoms may appear early or\\nwith a significant delay after exposure (Haponic et al. 1988). Increased alveolo-capillary\\npermeability, impaired lymphatic flow (Laffon et al. 1999), and pulmonary edema may also\\nensue after heavy exposures (Soejima et al. 2001).\\nHowever, repeated exposures to lower concentrations of smoke may not induce acute injuries\\nand can contribute to development of chronic respiratory illnesses including asthma (Kinsella et\\nal. 1991), chronic bronchitis and COPD (Pauwels et al. 2001).\\nSubacute smoke inhalation with borderline concentrations can result in both; acute respiratory\\nderangement and prepare the victims to develop chronic respiratory illness. In a previous survey\\nin Canada, deleterious effects of smoke arising from burning agricultural residues had been\\nobserved on aggravation of previous respiratory symptoms of patients suffering COPD (Long et\\nal. 1998). However, they did not elucidate the possible effects on respiratory health of\\nasymptomatic inhabitants in the area.\\nTable 4.

Therefore, the answers recorded in\\nthe questionnaires are more likely to represent the facts.\\nAs seen in Tables 2 and 3, significant increases both in the number of symptomatic cases and\\nthe severity of the previous disorders, as reflected in reduced FEV1 and FEF25–75 of the\\nsymptomatic cases, can be observed. These data confirm that exposure to smoke produced by\\nburning agricultural residues induces pulmonary symptoms in previously asymptomatic\\ninhabitants, possibly due to acute inflammation of airways, and also can aggravate previous\\nsymptoms in susceptible patients. The latter finding looks more obvious, since symptomatic\\nindividuals are more likely to seek medical assistance, but late morbidities associated with\\nrepeating exposures of uncomplaining persons to such contaminated air have been frequently\\nreported (Long et al. 1998; Dow et al. 1999; Gold et al. 2000), and should be of concern for\\ncommunities and physicians, especially in developing countries.\\nSignificant increases in suspended particulate maters (PM10) were recorded in the ambient air\\nin the area during the burning episode (Table 2), which seems to be responsible for the observed\\npulmonary symptoms.\\nThe findings of the present study are in accord with previous reports on the deleterious\\npulmonary effects of smoke induced by burning of agricultural residues or biomass fuels used\\nin developing countries (Bruce et al. 2000; Gold et al. 2000).\\nA recent study has established that the burning agricultural or forest residues can expose local\\ncommunities to relatively high levels of pollutants (Reinhardt et al. 2001).This high level of air\\npollution does not remain local and confined to nearby areas; it can affect places many\\nkilometers away from the burning sources (Lelieveld et al. 2001).\\nThere is evidence confirming that prolonged subacute exposure to biomass smoke can induce\\nchronic pulmonary parenchymal (Amoli 1998; gold et al. 2000), and/or chronic obstructive\\npulmonary disease (Bruce et al. 2000).\\nConclusions\\nAir pollution associated with the burning of agricultural residues is capable of aggravating pre-\\nexisting dyspnea, cough, night cough, night chest discomfort and exercise-induced cough in\\npatients with chronic respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, smoke exposure can induce all of the\\nabove-mentioned symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects. Also, obstructive spirometric\\npatterns are more often recorded after smoke exposure.\\nReferences\\nAmoli, K.
