Introduction
As per reports, raised levels of suspended particulate 
matters (SPMs having size PM10 and PM2.5) in ambient 
environment is the prime source to trigger various car-
diopulmonary diseases such as asthma, shortness of 
breath, and lung function disorders in humans.1-5 The 
burden of particulate matter (PM) affects the respiration 
rate and damages the lung organs by oxidative stress.6-8 
Among the sources, agriculture crop residue burning 
(ACRB) is a major source of ambient PMs as biowaste 
burning and forest fires.9-12 As per the World Health 
Organization reports, ACRB is an intentional practice 
by inhabitants that contributes approximately 29% of 
total PM pollution on a global scale.13,14
This study was conducted in the northwest part of Asia. 
The maximum area in this part is used for agriculture prac-
tice.15 Satellite-based studies reported the formation of 
dense clouds of smoke during and after ACRB periods and 
the smoke stays in ambient air for a long period of time 
through thousands of kilometers in this area.16,17 Many 
studies proposed statistically significant prediction models 
to evaluate human health parameters by exposure to SPM 
pollutants caused by industries, vehicles, construction sites, 
and indoor pollutants.18-20 These sources are constant emit-
ting sources.14 ACRB practice is an episodic practice that 
releases a huge amount of PM pollution (20-40 times more 
than National Ambient Air Quality Standards) in ambient 
environment.19 By critically reviewing the existing statisti-
cal models, it has been observed that the assessment mod-
els of exposures to pollutants are lacking in various aspects 
like design of study, sampling procedure, instrumentation, 
exposure estimation procedure, and statistical treatment of

Agriculture Crop Residue Burning  
and Its Consequences on Respiration 
Health of School-Going Children
Sachin Gupta, PhD1
Abstract
Crop waste burning in open fields is a matter of concern in relation to health-related complications in humans of all 
age groups, especially children. An epidemiological study was been done on school children to estimate the decline 
in their physiological parameters due to crop residue burning activity. A total of 150 children were inspected for 3 
years (2013-2016) at 3 different sites in India. During sampling periods, spirometric tests, ambient particulate matter 
having size ≥10 µg−3 and ≥2.5 µg−3, and other covariates were measured twice in a fortnight. After adjustment 
of data in multivariate mixed-effect model, prediction and statistical analyses were done. From results obtained, it 
has been observed that season wise, the level of fine particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) was higher in rice crop 
residue burning seasons than in wheat crop residue burning seasons by 87% to 123% than permitted monthly limits. 
As per dose-response relationship, maximum degradation was observed in forced vital capacity (−7.62%) and peak 
expiratory flow (−6.23%) parameters from their baseline values due to burning activities. Prediction equations have 
been purposed to observe the future trends in physiological parameters of children. Based on Tiffeneau index, an 
unrecoverable effect was seen in lung parameters. Trends were alarming and may cause serious complications in 
early age of humans.

collected data.5-7 The existing prediction models are 
adjusted to limited number of covariates and have esti-
mated prediction accuracy of 80% to 85% between mea-
sured and predicted values.21 There are still a number of 
lurking parameters that have to be identified and need to be 
adjusted in models.2,5 In the present study, the effect of PM 
on respiration-related parameters is quantified with adjust-
ment of covariates. The prediction equations were pro-
posed to forecast the trends in physiological parameters 
due to identified effect modifiers in areas affected by 
ACRB.
Methodology and Instrumentation
Study Design
The study was carried from September 2013 to August 
2016. The study period covers 3 seasons of rice and 3 
seasons of wheat crops residue burning. Ground-based 
aspects for selection of study areas, subjects, instru-
ments, and sampling frequency were studied before the 
actual collection of data.13
Selection of Sites and Subjects
Punjab (India) state was selected for the exposure 
assessment of ACRB practice on humans. Rice and 
wheat are the main cereal crops of this area due to their 
favorable geographical conditions. Every year, this 
state produces approximately 91.2 metric tons/year 
agriculture waste.19 Three schools were selected for 
sampling and data collection at 3 different sites of the 
region (one at each site). The details of sites are given 
in Table 1. The subjects were asked the American 
Thoracic Society (ATS) questionnaire for their back-
ground and health status. Spirometric tests were per-
formed on each subject to check the Tiffeneau index 
(ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1])/
(forced vital capacity [FVC]). The subjects having ratio 
less than 80% were considered as unhealthy; hence, 
they are not included.16 As per the ATS questionnaire 
and index ratio more than 80%, a total of 150 students 
(50 from each school) living within 1 km from schools 
were selected and recruited. The anthropometric details 
of subjects are given in Table 2. The details regarding 
previous medical history, passive smoking, or asthma 
symptoms are obtained by consent forms given to each 
family members of the selected candidates.
Instrumentation
PM Measurement.  The PM concentration levels were 
measured using Real-Time Optical Light Scattering 
Aerosol Monitor (RTOLSAM, Grimm Technology, 
Model 1.108, Germany) that is portable, light weight, 
and easy to operate.13,14 The test device consists of 4 
modes of operation: occupational health, environ-
ment, particle count, and mass concentration. The 
data were measured using mass concentration mode 
(15 channels, 0.23 µm to 20 µm). PM10 and PM2.5 
were computed from mass concentration mode using 
Grimm Technology equations.11 As per this mode, the 
PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations are calculated using

Measurement.  Physiological 
parameters such as FVC, FEV1, peak expiratory  
flow (PEF), and forced expiratory flow 25% to 75% 
(FEF25-75%) of all the selected subjects were measured by 
SPIRODOC (Medical International Research, Italy). 
For spirometer measurements, the device is automati-
cally adjusted for BTPS (body temperature, ambient 
pressure) conversions. The device is compliant with 
ATS/ERS (European Respiratory Society) protocols.1,20

entering anthropometric data of subjects such as ethnic-
ity, age, height (centimeter), weight (kilogram), and 
gender 5 times with interval of 10 minutes. The average 
of best 3 maneuvers were considered for analysis. For 
meaningful interpretation of spirometer parameters, the 
device compared the values with predicted values as per 
ERS equations and calculated percent predicted val-
ues.2,4 After computations, the data were stored in inbuilt 
memory and were retrieved later.17
Statistical Analysis
Multivariate mixed-effect model has been adopted for pre-
diction of trends with lag adjustment.7,9,14 The lag period 
signifies the sensitivity of dependent variables with regard 
to various time slots. The lower value of lag parameter indi-
cates high sensitivity in the measured parameters due to the 
role of independent variables. This model has flexibility to 
adjust both fixed and random variables with their normal 
and nonnormal distribution over time.8-10 In contrast to pre-
diction models, this model also accounts any missing data, 
heterogeneity between groups, repeated correlations, and 
variance-covariance relations of individual parameters for 
accuracy in estimation of sampled group.9 During the lon-
gitudinal period of study, both dependent variables (physi-
ological parameters—FVC, FEV1, PEF, and FEF25-75%) 
and independent variables (SPM, covariates like anthropo-
metric parameters of selected subjects, and meteorological 
parameters) were repeatedly measured.3 The Akaike crite-
ria and likelihood tests were simultaneously performed to 
examine the nested and nonnested clusters accounting for 
covariates correlation coefficients.9,13
Ethical Approval and Informed Consent
The ethical standards of the Indian Council of Medical 
Research committee with Reference No. 5/8/4-03-Env-
1/0-NCD-I were followed to perform these studies, and 
involvement of human participants was in accordance 
with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amend-
ments or comparable ethical standards. Written informed 
consent forms were collected from selected children 
(duly signed by school authorities and their parents) 
prior to involvement in the study.
Results
Particulate Matters Concentration Level
The study period covers 3 rice and 3 wheat crop residue 
burning seasons. The rice season was from July to 
December, and the wheat season was from January to 
June. The season-wise meteorological conditions are 
given in Table 3.
These crops are cyclic by nature and are very sensi-
tive to any kind of delay in their sowing process. In rice 
season, crop was ready to harvest in the middle of 
October. In November, crop remains were disposed of 
by burning in open fields. This practice increased the 
SPM level in the ambient air 20 to 70 times as per the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards limits.4 Due to 
meteorological constraints (low temperature, less pre-
cipitation, less wind speed, and high humidity), the rate 
of dispersion of PM concentration got reduced and 
hence the raised level of PM may be stable in the areas 
for next 1 to 2 months.5,15 During and after the burning 
periods, visibility was reduced due to thick layers of 
smoke in the surrounding environment. The satellite 
studies clearly present the trends in rice season.16 
Similarly, in the wheat season, the crop was ready to 
harvest in the middle of March. In April, the deposition 
of crop waste was done by burning practice in the fields. 
Again, the concentration level of SPM crossed standard 
levels by 10 to 40 times and violates the pollution con-
trol agencies’ guidelines. During wheat seasons, weather 
was favorable in dispersion of pollutants. Hence, in 
wheat season, PM levels took less time than rice season

to settle in the ambient air.5,22 The levels of PM10 and 
PM2.5 are presented in Table 4.
It has been observed that the concentration levels of 
SPM were high in both seasons and violates safely lim-
its. The levels were very high in rice season than wheat 
season due to the following reasons:
1.	
During wheat seasons, the dispersion coefficient 
is very favorable in settlement of SPM in the 
environment due to high temperature and mod-
erate wind speed of selected sites. In rice season, 
the dispersion coefficient is low due to unfavor-
able meteorological conditions.19-21
2.	
In wheat crop season, 20% to 40% of wheat crop 
waste was stored as fodder by the local inhabit-
ants. But rice waste is not stored due to silica 
content, which is considered as unhealthy for 
domestic animals.6
These are the major reasons for such differences in 
PM levels in both seasons. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio is also a 
key factor related to SPM pollution.7 The ratio inferences 
the content of fine PM in accumulative concentration 
level. In both seasons, the ratio varied from 0.60 to 0.81, 
which reveals that PM2.5 had a major portion in cumula-
tive PM10 concentration. Again, compared with wheat 
season, the ratio was more in rice season (Table 4). The 
PM having smaller size is more dangerous to human 
health because of their deep impact on alveolar sacs of 
lungs and reduces its capacity.2-5 Hence, it has been 
hypothesized that the raised level of SPM concentration 
may affect the working capacity of various respiration-
related physiological parameters of humans.
Assessment of Physiological Parameters
Season-wise, percent changes in physiological parame-
ters due to raised level of SPM in the affected area are 
shown in Table 5.
In rice seasons, maximum fall was estimated in FVC 
(−7.62) and PEF (−6.23) than other parameters. Similarly, 
in wheat seasons, maximum decline was observed in 
FVC (−5.21) and PEF (−4.91) than the remaining param-
eters. For the total study period, FVC (−4.78) and PEF 
(−4.63) had the same trends as rice and wheat crop waste 
burning seasons. It is very clear from the results of Table 
5 that the degradation in physiological parameters was 
due to raised level of SPM in ACRB episodes. The physi-
ological parameters are very sensitive to raised levels of 
SPM in ambient environment. Overall, the degradation 
in FVC and PEF were more than FEV1 (−3.64) and 
FEF25-75% (−1.52). As per the dose-response relationship, 
the physiological parameters of selected subjects lost the 
capacity (% predicted of FVC = −1.67, FEV1 = −1.23, 
PEF = −1.46 and FEF25-75% = −0.74). The Tiffeneau 
index was also reduced to 75%, which may indicate a 
permanent degradation in physiological parameters of 
selected subjects from baseline values. The respiration 
system also tries to recover the effects, but the effect was 
so intense that the mechanism is unable to recover. 
Prediction equations have been proposed to predict the 
trends while considering every relevant parameter.

For exhaust analysis, correlation coefficients between 
dependent variables and independent variables were 
measured. Based on the statistically significant correla-
tion coefficients (having P value <.01) between the 
variables, PM10 (−0.86), PM2.5 (−0.91), ambient tem-
perature (−0.76), and body mass index (BMI) of sub-
jects (−0.73) were observed to be the most significant 
effect modifiers. Statistical iterations were performed 
for each physiological parameter using a mixed-effect 
model with accumulation of variance-covariance rela-
tions of parameters to estimate the coefficients. Iterations 
were fitted with measured data, and their closeness to 
predict values were evaluated using concordance corre-
lation coefficient. Coefficient for different effect modi-
fiers are shown in Table 6.
During different lag periods, lag 2 had strongest asso-
ciations for different effect modifiers on measured phys-
iological parameters. The statistically significant 
prediction equations for FVC, FEV1, PEF, and FEF25-75%

The validation of time-lagged prediction equations 
were tested by concordance correlation coefficient for 
physiological parameters. The agreement between 
actual and predicted FVC (R2 = 0.96), FEV1 (R2 = 
0.93), PEF (R2 = 0.97), and FEF25-75% (R2 = 0.98) are 
shown in Figure 1.
It has observed from the agreement that the predic-
tion equations involve the potential effect modifiers 
with statistical significance. In coming periods, trends 
shall be observed for individual physiological parame-
ters with variations in independent parameters.
Discussion
Agriculture waste burning in open fields releases a huge 
amount of PM pollutants in the ambient environment 
that may cause serious and cognitive impairments in 
various body functions such as lungs and cardiovascular 
veins. As per latest MODIS (Moderate Resolution 
Imaging Spectroradiometer) and satellite-based evi-
dences, the dense plums have been identified in the 
areas and their transport to long distance areas via mete-
orological influences. In various studies, it has been 
found that the health of children is more vulnerable to 
raised levels of PM pollutants than other human sub-
jects. The physiological parameters of children such as 
FVC and PEF are the prime targets of PM. In this study, 
Table 5 reported that the maximum fall in physiological 
parameters was observed in rice season than wheat sea-
son due to more quantum number of SPM than wheat 
waste burning season. The meteorological parameters 
have a very important role in dispersion coefficient of 
pollutants in the sampled area and are well documented 
in previous studies18,19,21 Among physiological parame-
ters, FVC and PEF had more degradation than other 
parameters from baseline values due to ACRB activity 
in the affected area. FVC and PEF are the key biomark-
ers of respiration-related parameters.20 They had been 
identified as the prime indicators for chronic pulmonary 
implications. The results are well supported with the 
Table 5.  Percent Changes in Physiological Parameters Due to Cause of Crop Residue Burning in the Rice and Wheat Seasons

existing studies that found vulnerability of volume and 
flow of lungs for short-term rise in SPM in ambient air 
by different sources.
The Tiffeneau index is also a very important aspect 
to consider the health of lungs. As per pulmonology, it 
is a sign of obstruction in lungs mechanism.19 In this 
study, Tiffeneau index was also reduced from its base 
value (≥80%) to 72% in rice season and 75% in wheat 
season. In various studies, the ratio was just varying in 
a small fraction, but in this study, the decline in ratio is 
alarming with regard to children (age 8 to 16 years) and 
observed as a key element of restriction in lungs archi-
tecture.4,7 It has been mentioned in studies that the 
reduction in Tiffeneau index is an indication of various 
chronic diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, and reduction in capacity of alveolar 
sacs of lungs. Fortunately, no candidate was found with 
any kind of pulmonary disease at the end of study. But 
permanent changes were observed in physiological 
parameters and Tiffeneau index. As per studies of respi-
ratory system, the lung mechanism tries to recover their 
working capacity, but due to burden of pollutants, they 
are unable to retrieve their natural order.11 The results 
are very similar to studies that were conducted in differ-
ent countries to evaluate the effect of ambient PM on 
Tiffeneau index of children.10,12,19 But the results in this 
study summarized the trends in different physiological 
parameters of children due to ambient PM in areas 
affected by ACRB. Few studies proposed the prediction 
models for future trends in affected parameters due to 
exposure of pollutants. Those models were still lacking 
in adjustment of important parameters like BMI and 
temperature as independent parameters in prediction 
procedure.11,18,22 As per recent findings, the BMI of 
selected subjects and seasonal meteorological parame-
ters have a key role in estimating the trends. The statis-
tically significant results from Australian children were 
associating the role of temperature in winter seasonal 
PM with physiological parameters.21 The results of our 
previous findings also presented the role of BMI.2 
Persons having low and high BMI are more vulnerable 
to ambient pollutants than persons with normal BMI. 
The previous studies adjusted the anthropometric 
parameters (BMI) and meteorological parameters (tem-
perature) like covariates as deviation in intercept of 
dependent parameters in the prediction model due to

which their estimation accuracy was varied from 75% 
to 85%.11 In this study, BMI and temperature were 
adjusted as fixed-effect modifiers with SPM having 
size PM10 and PM2.5 to estimate the trends. With adjust-
ment of these parameters, the estimation accuracy was 
observed from 93% to 98%. Till now, there was no 
study on prediction model that proposed such accuracy. 
This study generalized the results to the whole popula-
tion, but there is need to discriminate the results on gen-
der basis for community-wise estimation.10,11,19 There is 
a scarcity in the study to associate the level of indoor 
pollution with physiological parameters, and the cogni-
tive level of subjects need to be considered in statistical 
modelling.23-25 But, proposed estimations in physiologi-
cal parameters are well supported to analyze the epi-
sodic trends due to ACRB practice and may contribute 
a significant role in designing control policies by 
national and international communities.
Conclusions
Significant fall was observed in FVC, PEF, and Tiffeneau 
index, which are the key markers related to respiration sys-
tem. The dose-response relationships were significantly 
indicating the role of effect modifiers in degradation of 
lungs capacity per year. The statistically significant predic-
tion equations were developed to predict the trends in 
upcoming seasons of ACRB episodes. It has been con-
cluded that the short-term rise in SPM due to ACRB prac-
tice causes a significant degradation in the health of 
inhabitants. Even such pollution levels may trigger other 
disorders like cognitive impairments and neurological 
complexity in children. The prediction equations shall be 
helpful for policy makers to design some strategic and legal 
regulations to control this practice, otherwise this practice 
may cause some serious health-related issues in human like 
asthma and pulmonary disorders. The agriculture crop

Abstract
Background: Half of the world’s population is exposed to household air pollution from biomass burning. This study
aimed to assess the relationship between respiratory symptoms and biomass smoke exposure in rural and urban
Nepal.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of adults (16+ years) in a rural population (n = 846) exposed to biomass smoke
and a non-exposed urban population (n = 802) in Nepal. A validated questionnaire was used along with measures
of indoor air quality (PM2.5 and CO) and outdoor PM2.5.
Results: Both men and women exposed to biomass smoke reported more respiratory symptoms compared to those
exposed to clean fuel. Women exposed to biomass were more likely to complain of ever wheeze (32.0 % vs. 23.5%;
p = 0.004) and breathlessness (17.8% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.017) compared to males with tobacco smoking being a major risk
factor. Chronic cough was similar in both the biomass and non-biomass smoke exposed groups whereas chronic
phlegm was reported less frequently by participants exposed to biomass smoke. Higher PM2.5 levels (≥2 SDs of the
24-hour mean) were associated with breathlessness (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.47, 2.99) and wheeze (1.76, 1.37, 2.26).
Conclusions: The study suggests that while those exposed to biomass smoke had higher prevalence of respiratory
symptoms, urban dwellers (who were exposed to higher ambient air pollution) were more at risk of having productive
cough.
Keywords: Respiratory symptoms, Breathlessness, Phlegm, Solid fuel, Household air pollution
Introduction
While the major cause of respiratory health problems
among adults in the developed world is smoking, exposure
to particles generated from biomass smoke is a major
cause of respiratory diseases in low income countries [1,2].
Several studies have reported higher prevalence of re-
spiratory ill-health among adults exposed to biomass
smoke with estimated risk ratios between 1.2 and 7.9 [3].
Most studies showing an association between household
air pollution and respiratory health problems used proxy
measurements of exposure such as the number of hours
spent on cooking, or simply ever used particular fuels. In
addition, not all of the important confounders, particularly
socio-economic status, smoking, fuel types and age, have
been adjusted for in earlier studies. Although positive
associations between chronic bronchitis and household air
pollution have been reported, there were large variations
in the prevalence of different respiratory symptoms [4,5].
A meta-analysis [3] reported positive associations between
the use of solid fuels and both chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary disease (COPD) (OR = 2.80, 95% CI 1.85, 4.00) and
chronic bronchitis (OR = 2.32, 95% CI 1.92, 2.80) but also
highlighted considerable heterogeneity in design, measure-
ment, and sizes of effect estimates in studies from different
low and middle income countries. To date, only one study
from Nepal has reported a relationship between directly
measured household exposure and respiratory symptoms

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/13/1/92although the exposure assessment was carried out only
during cooking [6].
This study aimed to investigate the relationship between
respiratory symptoms and lung function and direct mea-
sures of exposure to emissions from biomass and non-
biomass (particularly liquefied petroleum gas [LPG]) fuels in
rural and urban households in Nepal. We previously re-
ported a 20% prevalence of COPD in the biomass exposed
population compared to 11% in the urban population based
on spirometry data [7]. In this report we focus on the
respiratory symptoms.
Methods
Design and study sample
This cross-sectional study was carried out between April
2006 and February 2007. The biomass-exposed population
(98.9% used wood) was sampled from two village develop-
ment committees (VDCs) in the Kathmandu Valley. Four
wards (out of nine) in each VDC were randomly selected
and all individuals in the selected wards aged ≥16 years
were eligible if they met the inclusion criteria (no doctor
diagnosed major respiratory or cardiovascular health
problems and agreement to 24-h continuous airborne
exposure monitoring in their homes). The non-exposed
population (98.4% used LPG) were selected from six
wards (from a total of 35) in the Kathmandu municipality:
three were selected randomly near the ring road and the
other three selected from 1–2 km inside the ring road.
Further details were published elsewhere [7,8]. The sample
size was based on lung function assuming a prevalence of
COPD of 10% in the non-exposed and 20% in the exposed
populations, the latter being twice the reported prevalence
for Nepalese populations [7].
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to
collect data on smoking, socio-economic status, literacy,
kitchen characteristics, cooking details, history of fuel use,
and respiratory symptoms. The questionnaire was trans-
lated into Nepalese and back translated into English by an
independent translator and a pilot study was conducted to
identify issues of logistics and understanding. The study
protocol was approved by the Nepal Health Research
Council. Written, informed consent was obtained from all
study participants.
Measurements of exposure
Levels of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diam-
eter <2.5 μm (PM2.5) were measured over a continuous
24-h period in most dwellings (n = 490) using photo-
metric devices (SidePak AM510 and DustTrak Model
8520, TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), from which mean
24-h PM2.5 (in μg/m3) was derived. We report here the
results from 442 households (206 biomass burning; 236
non-biomass burning) which had at least 20 h data. Out-
door PM2.5 concentrations were measured in both rural
and urban areas on the veranda (for logistic and security
reasons) in 118 homes (46 biomass burning, 72 non-
biomass burning). Indoor 24-h carbon monoxide (CO)
concentrations (in ppm) were measured in 126 homes (40
biomass burning, 86 non-biomass burning) using HOBO
CO loggers (MicroDAQ, Contoocook, NH, USA). The dir-
ect reading photometric instruments were calibrated using
data from co-located gravimetric samplers [8].
Assessment of respiratory outcomes
Respiratory symptoms were based on the Medical Research
Council (MRC) questionnaire and included cough, phlegm,
breathlessness, and wheezing/whistling. Breathlessness was
measured using the five-level modified MRC (mMRC)
dyspnoea scale [9]. In this report we define breathlessness
as those falling into Grade 2 or above. Participants who
reported to have cough or bring up phlegm first thing in the
morning for at least three months each year were considered
to have chronic cough or phlegm, respectively. Chronic
bronchitis was defined as the presence of both chronic
cough and chronic phlegm. Participants also underwent
spirometry as reported elsewhere [9]. For comparability with
previous studies, we defined airflow obstruction in two ways:
(i) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) to forced vital
capacity (FVC) ratio less than the lower limit of normal
(LLN); or (ii) FEV1/FVC <0.70 [7].
Covariates
Height and weight were measured using standard proto-
cols [10], from which body mass index (BMI) was com-
puted (in kg/m2). Participants were classified as non-, ex-
and current smokers, where the latter two categories had
smoked at least 20 packs of cigarettes or 360 g of tobacco
in a lifetime, or at least one cigarette per day or one cigar a
week for one year. We also collected information on ex-
posure to environmental tobacco smoke and current occu-
pation. We used monthly household income (in Nepalese
Rupees where 1 US$ ≈100 Rs) and educational level as
proxies for socio-economic status.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA (version
12, College Station, TX, USA). Results for PM2.5 and CO
concentrations are expressed as geometric means and geo-
metric standard deviations unless indicated otherwise.
Mean indoor PM2.5 concentrations >2 standard deviations
(SD) of the arithmetic means over the entire sampling win-
dow were also calculated from the real time exposure data
and are reported here to assess any associations between
dependent variables and maximal exposures (i.e. during
cooking). Baseline demographic characteristics were com-
pared between biomass and non-biomass exposed partici-
pants separately for men and women by regression taking
into account the household clustering effect. Regression

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/13/1/92models were constructed to evaluate the effect of pollutants
(biomass, exposure to PM2.5 and CO independently) on re-
spiratory symptoms. All known and potential confounders
(age, income, educational level, smoking status, and BMI)
were adjusted for to obtain regression coefficients (β) with
robust variance estimates to allow for household clustering.
Results
Among 1648 participants (762 men and 886 women)
enrolled, 846 (51%) used biomass and 802 (49%) used non-
biomass fuels (primarily LPG), respectively. The proportion
of current smokers, underweight, illiterate and those having
lower income were higher among biomass users (Table 1).
Around 35% of rural women had smoked at some point in
their lives compared to only 9% of urban dwellers.
The geometric mean (± geometric SD) 24-h indoor PM2.5
concentration in biomass using homes was significantly
greater than in non-biomass using homes (455 ± 2.4 vs.
101 ± 2.0 μg/m3, p <0.001), although there was no significant
difference in outdoor air pollution between biomass and
non-biomass using homes (129 ± 2.7 vs. 115 ± 2.5 μg/m3,
p = 0.249). PM2.5 measured concurrently on the veranda
and 100 m from five biomass burning houses showed sub-
stantially higher concentrations (129 ± 1.5 μg/m3) com-
pared to the outdoor environment (7.4 ± 2.8 μg/m3). Mean
peak indoor PM2.5 (defined as >2 SD of the mean level over
the entire sampling window) was 1790 μg/m3 in homes
using biomass and 141 μg/m3 in non-biomass homes
(arithmetic means 2828 and 335 μg/m3, respectively).
The 24-h CO concentrations in kitchens using biomass
fuel were significantly higher than in non-biomass fuel

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/13/1/92homes (13.4 ± 2.2 vs. 2.0 ± 2.0 ppm, p <0.001). The levels of
PM2.5 and CO were much higher during cooking particu-
larly in those houses where biomass was used as cooking
fuel (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
In general symptom prevalence increased with age
(Additional file 2: Table S1). Table 2 presents age-adjusted
prevalence of breathlessness, wheeze, and chronic bron-
chitic symptoms. Dsypnoea (mMRC ≥Grade 2) and wheez-
ing (ever or on most days/nights) were more common
among biomass users compared to those who used non-
biomass fuel (p <0.001), with age-adjusted prevalence of
dyspnoea being 17.8% (95% CI 14.1, 21.5%) among female
and 12.0% (8.9, 15.1%) among male biomass fuel users,
compared to 7.6% (5.1, 10.1%) and 2.5% (1.0, 4.1%) among
cleaner fuel users. Likewise, wheezy chest was approxi-
mately three times more likely to be reported by those
using biomass fuel. On the other hand, male non-biomass
users reported significantly more chronic phlegm (12.9%;
95% CI 9.6, 16.3%) compared to biomass users (3.0%; 1.4,
4.7%, p <0.001). Such difference was not observed in
females. When restricting to non-smokers, all symptom
prevalence was lower, although not statistically differ-
ent from the entire sample. Dyspnoea and wheeze were
more prevalent among biomass users. In contrast the
prevalence of chronic phlegm was higher in non-biomass
users (p <0.001), both in males and in females (p = 0.041).
Adjusting for potential confounders, those using bio-
mass were associated with a significantly increased risk
in breathlessness and wheeze. The increase in risk for
dyspnoea was larger among men (OR = 7.88; 95% CI 2.84,
21.88) than among women (3.90; 2.00, 7.79), but the oppos-
ite was true for wheeze (Table 3). There was a negative as-
sociation
between
biomass
use
and
chronic
phlegm
prevalence, although this was significant only in men
(OR = 0.21; 95% CI 0.09, 0.47). The magnitude of risk
estimate was smaller when other measures of indoor
pollutants (24-h mean PM2.5, PM2.5 >2 SD and CO)
were used. Whilst the level of PM2.5 was much lower
outdoors compared to indoors, there was a positive re-
lationship between outdoor PM2.5 and chronic phlegm
in both sexes, although neither reached statistical sig-
nificance. Restriction to non-smokers made no material
changes in the risk estimates, with statistical signifi-
cance disappeared in wheeze among males due to the
reduction in power (data not shown).
There was an inverse association between FEV1 and dys-
pnoea, ever wheeze and chest illness in the last 12 months
in women and with chronic phlegm in men after adjusting
for height, age, education, BMI, income and smoking status
(Additional file 3: Table S2).
Discussion
This study shows that the risk of reporting wheeze (ever and
on most days and nights) and dyspnoea (mMRC scale ≥2)
were significantly higher among those exposed to biomass
smoke, particularly in women. These respiratory symptoms
were also positively associated with quantitative measures of
PM2.5 greater than two standard deviation of the mean but

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/13/1/92not to the 24-h average mean, suggesting that peaks of
pollution may be more important than average exposures.
Those exposed to biomass smoke who had respiratory
symptoms were more likely to have lower lung function
and the prevalence of airflow obstruction was significantly
higher amongst the older individuals.
All respiratory symptoms were self-reported without fur-
ther clinical assessment, which may have resulted in mis-
classification. People in low-income countries often consider
wheeze, breathlessness and bringing up phlegm to some
extent as normal which may result in under-reporting of
symptoms and if this was differentially expressed between
exposed and non-exposed groups this may underestimate
the true risk. The respiratory questionnaire used was devel-
oped and validated in developed countries and although our
version was back translated to ensure best delivery of ques-
tions interpretative issues may have arisen. For instance,
there is no terminology in Nepali for the term “wheeze”
which could have caused some confusion among inter-
viewees but efforts were made to minimise these by using
bilingual speakers from their local communities trained in
questionnaire delivery.
The major strengths of this study are its size, the use of a
comparator group (studying biomass smoke exposed and
non-exposed groups) and the adjustment for confounders,
often inadequately dealt with in previous studies. We in-
cluded young adults (≥16 years) because in Nepal cooking
is usually delegated to adolescents, particularly girls and
those living in the rural areas.
Previous work has studied populations using different
types of biomass smoke for varying lengths of time making
comparisons difficult especially when the issues of con-
founding is inconsistently addressed. Behera and Jindal [11]
reported prevalences of respiratory symptoms for different
types of fuel users (biomass, kerosene, LPG and mixed) in
Indian women and found that respiratory symptoms did
not follow any clear pattern: chronic bronchitis was greater
in biomass users, cough greater in kerosene users and
breathlessness in mixed fuel users. Other studies [12,13]
have not found an association between exposures to wood
smoke and respiratory symptoms but a randomised con-
trolled trial study in Guatemala [14] of respiratory symp-
toms in women involved in cooking reported that women
provided with improved cook stoves reported significantly
less wheeze compared to baseline but with no significant
reduction in other respiratory symptoms.
Our study recorded significantly higher “ever wheeze” in
the rural compared to the urban area, similar to previous
reports from Nepal (wood smoke) [6,15], Canada [16,17]
(smoke from burning agricultural residue and wood),
India [11] (biomass smoke), China [18,19] (coal smoke)
and Guatemala [20] (wood smoke). The presence of sig-
nificantly higher prevalence of wheeze (ever, on most
days/nights, and in the last 12 months) in the rural, life-
long non-smoking population further suggests that the risk
of being wheezy is likely to increase in populations exposed
to biomass smoke. The risk of ever wheeze in biomass
smoke exposed women was 60% higher compared to men
but there were no significant differences between urban
males and females. The risk of ever wheeziness increased
with age for the biomass exposed population but not for
the non-exposed population suggesting that prolonged
exposure to biomass smoke increases the risk although in
other studies respiratory symptoms have generally in-
creased with age. Ex-smokers showed more than a six-fold
increase in ever wheeze in the biomass smoke exposed
population and a three-fold increase in the urban population
compared to life-long non-smokers whereas the additional
risks in current smokers were nearly three and two fold
respectively. The higher risk in the ex-smokers could be
explained as the ex-smokers gave up smoking only after they
were medically diagnosed with respiratory problems which
might have persuaded them to quit smoking. Similar results
for ex- and current smokers were found for wheeze in the
last 12 months.
Self-reported chronic phlegm was significantly higher
in non-smoking, non-biomass exposed men (6.7%) and
women (4.9%) compared to the exposed group (men
2.7%, women 2.0%), contrary to the findings reported by
other studies in Nepal [6] and other countries [11,19].
This finding is both marked and surprising and while
this might be due to bias in reporting, the risk in the
urban population might be real. Most of the urban
dwellers were exposed to biomass at some point in their
early years and there might have been a residual effect of
that early pollutant exposure but this should not over-
whelm current exposure. This finding could also possibly
be due to the higher urban outdoor air pollution concen-
trations from vehicle generated pollutants although other
causes unrelated to air quality such as post nasal discharge
may be a possibility. There have been abundant studies in
industrialised countries on the short and long term health
effects of vehicle generated ambient air pollution, with
special emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular health
effects [21-23] showing positive correlations between
these health outcomes and concentrations of ambient air
pollutants. It is possible that vehicle generated particles re-
leased in ambient air are more toxic in the context of
mucus hyper-secretion compared to biomass smoke and
thus cause more respiratory symptoms but future studies
are needed to assess the differential toxicity due to differ-
ent types of fuel [24,25] and also compare with existing
toxicity data from vehicle generated particles.
Unsurprisingly production of cough and phlegm was
more common in both current and ex-smokers and also
in older age groups. Phlegm production was greatest in
the biomass exposed illiterate population indicating that
socio-economic status is a risk factor and living within a
Kurmi et al. Environmental Health 2014, 13:92
Page 6 of 8
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/13/1/92kitchen with no ventilation increased phlegm production
in both the rural and urban populations but not statistically
significantly so. This indicates that exposure to kitchen
fumes (smoke from fuel burning and also mist from cook-
ing oil when heated) might be a risk factor, again a poten-
tial surrogate indicator of exposure.
Biomass smoke exposed men and women reported more
breathlessness compared to their non-exposed counterparts
but the difference was only significant for biomass smoked
compared to non-biomass exposed males. Recorded breath-
lessness in this study is lower compared to other published
studies. As the biomass smoke exposed area was in a hilly
region, the population might have attributed breathlessness
to exertion rather than to inhalation of biomass smoke,
especially as females do a lot of manual work in the fields. It
is also possible that our sample is relatively young (mean age
35 years), hence less likely to have (and admit to have)
dyspnoea. Cooking with kerosene increased the risk of
developing breathlessness in urban dwellers (results not
shown) but this result was based on a very small number of
individuals and could just be a chance finding.
Direct measurement of exposure as mean 24-h indoor
PM2.5 in this study failed to show any significant associa-
tions with respiratory symptoms but some of the proxy
measurements such as use of biomass, illiteracy and poor
ventilation (data not shown) showed a relationship suggest-
ing that exposure to biomass smoke might be a risk for re-
spiratory symptoms. Of interest is that when we considered
peak smoke exposures (taken as mean PM2.5 >2 SDs above
the 24-h mean) a relationship between respiratory symp-
toms and exposures emerged, suggesting that time spent at
concentrations that are considerably higher than back-
ground may be more important than consistently high
exposures.
The odds of presence of airflow obstruction was greater
amongst those exposed to biomass although it did not
reach statistical significance. The higher prevalence of
respiratory symptoms such as wheeze and breathlessness
without having airflow obstruction could be due to the high
proportion of younger individuals in our sample. Alterna-
tively, it is possible that spirometry was not sensitive
enough to detect the very early stage of airflow obstruction.
Conclusions
In summary, in this study the prevalence of wheeze in a
biomass smoke exposed population is in line with most of
the previous findings in Nepal and other low-income
countries but the results for cough differ. This ambiguity
regarding the cough and phlegm results from urban Nepal
should be interpreted with special attention. Future studies
in urban Nepal looking at respiratory symptoms should be
looking at all the aspects like toxicity of outdoor pollutants
and whether any other risk factors are confounding the
results.

Association between sugar cane burning and
acute respiratory illness on the island of Maui
Christina Louise Mnatzaganian1*, Karen L. Pellegrin2, Jill Miyamura3, Diana Valencia4 and Lorrin Pang5
Abstract
Background: Sugar cane harvesting by burning on Maui island is an environmental health issue due to respiratory
effects of smoke. Volcanic smog (“vog”) from an active volcano on a neighboring island periodically blankets Maui
and could confound a study of cane smoke’s effects since cane burning is not allowed on vog days. This study
examines the association between cane burning and emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and
prescription fills for acute respiratory illnesses.
Methods: This retrospective study controlled for confounders that could increase respiratory distress on non-burn
days by matching each burn day with a non-burn day and then comparing the ratio of patients with respiratory
distress residing in the path of sugar burn smoke to those residing elsewhere on Maui on burn versus non-burn
days. Patients with acute respiratory distress were defined as those with one or more acute respiratory diagnoses at
one of the hospitals or emergency departments on Maui. Separately, patients with acute respiratory illness were
identified through prescription records from four community pharmacies, specifically defined as those who filled
prescriptions for acute respiratory distress.
Results: There were 1,256 reports of respiratory distress prescriptions and 686 hospital/ED diagnoses of acute
respiratory illness. The ratio of cases within to outside of smoke exposure was higher on burn days for both the
ED/hospital data and the pharmacy, though not statistically significant. In post-hoc analyses of the pharmacy data
based on the number of acres burned as a proxy for volume of smoke, there was a dose response trend for
acreage burned such that the highest quartile showed a statistically significant higher proportion of acute
respiratory distress in the exposed versus non-exposed regions (P = 0.015, OR 2.4, 95 % CI [1.2–4.8]).
Conclusions: After adjusting for confounders on non-burn days, there was a significantly higher incidence of
respiratory distress in smoke-exposed regions when greater amounts of acres were burned. Health officials should
consider actions to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with sugar cane burning practices.

Background
Outdoor air pollution is associated with mortality and
hospital admissions due to respiratory and cardiovascu-
lar disease in both short-term and long-term studies [1].
There is a paucity of research on the specific impact of
sugar cane burning on health, despite evidence that it is
at least as toxic as pollution produced by traffic and
more toxic than traffic after repeated exposures [2, 3]. In
particular, no published studies have examined the
impact of current sugar cane burning practices on the
island of Maui in Hawaii.
Sugar plantations were established two centuries ago
on the islands of Hawaii. Today, only the island of Maui
continues to produce 200,000 tons of cane annually [4].
Controlled, scheduled burns of cane fields occur prior to
harvest to reduce the volume of waste material for trans-
port and processing. Cane field fires produce smoke and
ash above the Maui central valley resulting in ash fall
locally known as “Maui snow”. Burns typically begin in
the early morning hours and end before dawn, thereby

Burning rules are set and monitored by the Hawaii
Department of Health (DOH). Burning is prohibited on
days when high amounts of volcanic smog (“vog”)
occur on Maui, originating from the consistently-active
Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii, located
117 miles southeast of Maui. There is a general north-
easterly wind direction during days when cane burning
is allowed. When vog blows in on weaker southerly
winds, it tends to uniformly expose Maui’s entire island
population. Therefore, vog could confound clinical/
epidemiologic studies of cane burning’s respiratory effects
if one used days of no cane burning as controls for days of
burning. Additionally, cane cannot be burned during
extremely rainy weather, which is associated with cold
symptoms, another potential confounder. Therefore, com-
parisons of burn versus non-burn days on Maui require
methods that control for at least these confounders.
The study of sugar cane burning on Maui is a particu-
larly important environmental health issue given the
relatively high prevalence of asthma in Hawaii. Accord-
ing to the National Center for Environmental Health,
asthma affects 16.9 % of children and 16.1 % of adults in
Hawaii, higher than the US prevalence of 12.5 % and
13.3 %, respectively [5, 6]. Asthma exacerbations have
continually contributed to increasing emergency de-
partment (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and mortality [7].
Hawaii reports approximately 5,000 ED visits and 1,500
hospital admissions annually due to asthma exacerba-
tions [8]. According to the National Institute of Health,
environmental factors that may trigger or exacerbate
acute respiratory illnesses include viral respiratory in-
fections, environmental allergens, smoking, exercise,
occupational chemicals, environmental changes, irri-
tants, emotions, stress, drugs, food, changes in weather,
exposure to cold air, and endocrine and comorbid con-
ditions [9]. Cane burning and vog emissions are typical
examples of smoke, chemical, and particulates on Maui.
Additionally, residents may be exposed to molds and
viral infections during extremely wet and rainy weather
when cane burning is not permitted.
There are only a few published studies to date that
examine the health effects of sugar cane burning and none
examining health effects under current DOH burning re-
strictions in the unique environment of Hawaii. Lehman
studied 36 patients who were scheduled for intracutaneous
skin testing due to significant chronic allergy problems.
When exposed to sugar cane smoke extract, there was a
significant increase (P < 0.01) in positive skin reactions in
subjects exposed to cane smoke extract as compared to
the control group [10]. In Louisiana, there were 6,498 hos-
pital visitations for asthma during a two-year study period
with a positive (though not significant) dose–response
trend in asthma hospitalization rates during sugar cane
burning [11].
Brazilian studies demonstrate an association with ad-
verse health effects. One study analyzed 673 records of
children less than thirteen years old and elderly greater
than 64 years old and found particulate matter (PM) and
carbon monoxide (CO) markers from cane burning led
to respiratory effects [12]. Data analysis showed that the
PM10 during the nonburning period was 28.9 ± 12.8 μg/m3
compared to 87.7 ± 57.9 μg/m3 during the burning
period. The PM2.5 during the nonburning period was
10.0 ± 4.6 μg/m3 compared to 22.8 ± 14.7 μg/m3 during
the burning period. In both the child and elderly group,
PM10, PM2.5, and black carbon were significantly asso-
ciated with respiratory hospital admissions even after
adjusting for season and weather. These correlations
remained significant even after adjusting for season
and weather.
In another ecological time-series study, total sus-
pended particle (TSP) concentrations from cane burning
doubled during burn periods with a statistically signifi-
cant increase in asthma hospital admissions 1–5 days
after increasing TSP concentrations [13]. Study authors
used a lag structure of 0 to 9 days between burn dates
and hospital admissions with adjustments for over-
dispersion. During the 493 days of the study, there were
a total of 640 asthma hospital admissions; during the
burning period (318 days) there were 477 admissions, a
rate 50 % higher, and statistically significant, compared
to
163
admissions
during
the
non-burning
period
(175 days).
In a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 1,076 private-
and public-schooled children aged 10–14, Riguera found
lower asthma symptoms but higher rates of rhinitis in
children during times of burning [14]. Through a series
of assessments, he found that the prevalence of asthma
and rhinitis symptoms was 11 % and 33.2 %, respect-
ively. Rhinitis occurred most frequently from June to
October, a period that matches the sugar cane harvest
season in Brazil as well as seasonal variations. Addition-
ally, daily prevalence of peak expiratory flow below 20 %
of the median of each child’s best measurements was
greater in days with higher PM2.5 concentrations. The
authors concluded that the prevalence of asthma symp-
toms was actually below the national Brazilian average
(19 %) whereas rhinitis prevalence exceeded the national
average (29.6 %) during the study period.
More recently, there is evidence that reduction of pre-
harvest sugar cane burning in response to a state law in
Brazil requiring the gradual elimination of this practice
has been associated with a decrease in hospitalizations
due to respiratory disease [15].
In 1972, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) studied cane and leaf burning from Hawaii
Mnatzaganian et al. Environmental Health  (2015) 14:81 
Page 2 of 8crops in an incinerating tower for pollutant analysis [16].
Burning of 20 whole cane plots and 19 cane leaf trash
samples
yielded
particulates,
carbon
monoxide,
and
hydrocarbon emissions all within normal ranges of many
other herbaceous types of fuel previously burned within
the tower. During whole cane burns, particulate yields
averaged 112 lbs/acre of fuel burned (99 % CI with true
mean between 92 and 132 lbs/acre), which was deter-
mined to not be excessive. The carbon monoxide yield
averaged 1,113 lbs/acre (99 % CI with true mean between
843 and 1,383 lbs/acre), and also determined to be a
moderate amount emitted, similar to the yield from dry
cereal grain straw. Finally, the hydrocarbon yield averaged
152 lbs/acre (99 % CI with true mean of 121 lbs/acre) and
authors concluded this also to be within normal emis-
sions. Pollutant yields from leaf trash were a little less than
from whole cane; additionally, those fires simulated
against the direction of wind flow did not emit any signifi-
cant difference compared those in the direction of wind
flow. However, this marker study does not address all pol-
lutants potentially causing health problems or examine if
mixtures of pollutants have a compounding effect. For
example, vog is another source of air pollution on Maui
and was studied at a clinic downwind from the active vol-
cano on the Big Island of Hawaii [17]. In sampling 1,189
patients, high vog exposure during increased volcanic ac-
tivity was associated with a six-fold increase in health
visits for acute airway problems, cough, headache, and
pharyngitis.
Given the link between sugar cane burning and nega-
tive respiratory health outcomes in other locations, the
high prevalence of asthma in Hawaii, and the complex
environment in Hawaii, it is important to study the im-
pact of current sugar burning practices on Maui. There-
fore, this study retrospectively examines the relationship
between sugar cane
burning and acute respiratory
illnesses on the island of Maui on burn days while con-
trolling for confounding factors likely to be present on
non-burn days.
Methods
Study design
This study used a historical, controlled (paired), and par-
tially blinded design to compare the ratio of respiratory
distress events among those residing in the path of sugar
cane burn smoke to those residing elsewhere on Maui
on burn versus non-burn days. This design controls for
confounding variables (e.g., vog and rain) on the non-
burn days. The ratio of cases from smoke exposure area
to non-exposed areas was hypothesized to be higher on
burn days compared to non-burn days. The Institutional
Review Boards of the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii
DOH granted ethical approval.
Data sources
Cane burning records between April 2011-April 2012
were obtained from the DOH. This period was selected
because cane employees used a newer, detailed system of
reporting information with spot-check confirmation by
DOH personnel. Investigators selected 55 burn days
where burning was completed by 6:00 AM (to ensure
residential exposures only), more than 70 acres were
burned, and uniform wind speed greater than zero. Each
burn day was matched with a random non-burn day that
was preceded by at least four days of no burning as a
“washout” period.
DOH field maps and Google Earth software were then
utilized to identify areas where burning occurred. The
sugar cane company maps and numbers all cane fields
so the burn location and acreage is available in records
submitted to the DOH. Investigators plotted the site of
the burn and drew a cone of smoke exposure based on
the averaged wind directions with a 30 degree angle of
smoke dispersion. This angle was determined from ob-
servations of smoke from the sugar mill during a variety
of wind conditions as well as previously conducted re-
search [18]. Areas of exposure were drawn to the edge
of the island.
Respiratory distress events on selected burn and non-
burn dates were obtained from two sources: a database
of all hospital admissions and all ED visits on Maui and
four community pharmacies on Maui. Hospital admis-
sion and ED data pertaining to acute respiratory disease
were obtained from Hawaii Health Information Corpor-
ation (HHIC). HHIC collects, cleans, and verifies de-
tailed patient-level discharge data from hospitals for all
payers in the state of Hawaii. HHIC data elements in-
clude patient race/ethnicity, age, gender, insurer, length
of stay, patient residence, and primary and secondary
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision
(ICD-9) diagnostic codes. Specifically, the following dis-
charges and ED visits were obtained from HHIC on
selected burn and non-burn days: asthma with exacer-
bation (ICD-9 493.02), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 466.0),
acute sinusitis (ICD-9 461), acute pharyngitis including
streptococcal pharyngitis (ICD-9 462; 034.0), acute con-
junctivitis (ICD-9 372.0), cough (ICD-9 786.2), head-
ache (ICD-9 339), all pneumonias (ICD-9 480–486),
and other acute airway problems (requiring immediate
treatment such as oxygen, medications, or respiratory
treatments, ICD-9 786.05).
Databases of prescriptions filled from four commu-
nity pharmacies in four different regions (representing
13 % of the pharmacies on Maui) were queried for the
following medications used to treat respiratory condi-
tions: albuterol, ipratropium, and albuterol/ipratropium
inhalers and nebulizers, nasal sprays including flu-
ticasone, mometasone, and flunisolide, promethazine/

and
200 mg), prednisone tablets (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg),
methylprednisolone dose-packs, and medications for
conjunctivitis including prednisolone, olopatadine, and
prednisolone eye drops.
For each respiratory distress event (i.e., hospital admis-
sion, ED visit, prescription filled), the patient’s home ad-
dress was obtained. Patients with residences outside of
Maui were excluded, and those with multiple qualifying
diagnoses or prescriptions were counted as one exposure.
For each burn day and matched non-burn day, sub-
jects with one or more respiratory distress events were
plotted to reside either in the area of cane smoke ex-
posure or outside of it. To facilitate understanding of
the design, subjects from both burn days and non-burn
days were plotted on the same map (Fig. 1). Data were
tallied across all pairs of days retaining the exposed vs.
non-exposed and burn day vs. non-burn day designa-
tions. A 2x2 Chi-square test was used to compare these
mutually exclusive counts, aggregated across all burn/
non-burn day pairs. An equivalent approach would be
to take the odds ratio (OR) of these two ratios with a
null hypothesis of no effect having this OR (burn day
ratio: non-burn day ratio) = 1.

Page 4 of 8Results
There were 191 burn days from April 2011-April 2012; 55
burn days and 55 matching non-burn days were chosen
based on the criteria previously detailed (Table 1).
Hospital data
Island-wide, there were 315 hospital/ED acute respira-
tory visits on burn days and 371 hospital/ED visits on
non-burn days (N = 686); without any mapping to smoke
exposure versus no exposure there was a significantly
higher (P = 0.04) rate of respiratory illnesses on the days
when cane was not burned (Table 1). However, in the
analyses of exposed vs. non-exposed smoke areas to con-
trol for the confounders on non-burn days, 37 (11.7 %)
of the 315 cases on burn days were exposed compared
to 34 (9.2 %) of the 371 cases from the corresponding
areas during non-burn days (Table 2). This higher pro-
portion of respiratory distress from exposed areas on
burn days was not significant (P = 0.33; RR = 1.28, 95 %
CI [0.82–2.0]).
Pharmacy data
Similar results were found with the pharmacy data.
Island-wide, there were 576 patients who filled respiratory
prescriptions on burn days and 680 subjects who filled
prescriptions on non-burn days (N = 1,256); without map-
ping to smoke exposure areas there was a significantly
higher number during non-burn days (P = 0.0025; RR
1.18, 95 % CI [1.06–1.31]) (Table 1). However, in smoke
exposure mapping analyses of exposed vs. non-exposed
areas to control for confounders on non-burn days, 76
(13.2 %) of the 576 cases on burn days were exposed com-
pared to 78 (11.5 %) of the 680 cases in the corresponding
areas during the non-burn days (Table 2). This greater
proportion of respiratory distress in the area of exposure
on burn days was not statistically significant.
Thus, the hypothesis that the ratio of respiratory dis-
tress events among those inside to outside smoke ex-
posure areas would be greater on burn day than on
non-burn days was not supported with either hospital
data or pharmacy data. To explore the possibility of dose
response in post-hoc analyses, the selected burn days (and
paired non-burn days) were broken down by quartiles ac-
cording to the acreage burned; in essence, into four
smaller studies using data from the community phar-
macies. There was a statistically significant (P = 0.02;
OR = 2.4 (95 % CI [1.2–4.8]) higher proportion of
illness from the smoke exposed areas during the highest
quartile of cane burning based on number of acres
burned. The remaining quartiles did not show statisti-
cally significant differences although the OR trended
downwards as the amount of cane burned decreased by
acreage (1.07, 0.86, 0.74, respectively) (Table 3).
To estimate study power and sample size, with 177
total exposures from each of the burn and non-burn
days one could have detected a shift in cases from 15 to
11 % of total cases in the exposed areas between the
burn and non-burn days, respectively (alpha error of 5 %
and beta of 20 %). With 750 in each group one had the
same power to detect a smaller 15 % to 13 % shift.
Statistical calculations were done using EPIINFO 7.0; if
not specified otherwise, P-values were calculated by
Fishers Exact tests.
Discussion
The use of global positioning system (GPS) mapping
allowed study investigators to compare the ratio of cases
of cane-smoke exposed regions during burning to the
ratio of cases from these same areas when no burning
occurred to isolate the effect of burning. Comparison of
these two ratios adjusted for vog, as well as other
geographical or temporal confounding effects. Without
these adjustments we showed there was significantly
more symptoms on the days when cane was not burned,
which would be expected due to respiratory effects of
vog and the prohibition of burning cane on vog days.

Page 5 of 8With these adjustments there was an increase, although
statistically insignificant, in the proportion of cases from
smoke-exposed areas during days of cane burning. When
this same analysis was repeated by quartiles of acreage of
cane burned as a “dose” effect, there was a trend showing
higher proportions from the smoke-exposed areas when
more cane was burned. The highest quartile showed a sta-
tistically significant higher proportion corresponding to
2.4 fold increase in the expected number of cases and a
dose–response effect by quantity of acreage burned.
When studying the health impact of cane burning, the
typical design would tally all acute symptoms associated
with a burn event and compare to control periods with
no cane smoke exposure. It is typically assumed that
most or all of the acute symptoms caused by cane burning
occur temporally near the burn event. When symptoms
(or the measurable events reflecting the symptoms) might
lag the burn event by a few days, designs must account for
this potential lag to ensure that the control period isn’t
“contaminated” with lagged effects from the burn event.
In this study, control periods were chosen to account for
this potential lag in symptoms by selecting non-burn days
that were preceded by at least four days of no burning.
Similarly, designs that limit measurement of acute symp-
toms to the day of the burn event risk missing lagged
symptoms that are caused by the event. While this ap-
proach was used in this study and represents a limitation,
measuring symptoms in the first 24 h after exposure was
believed to be the best way to capture most of those
caused by the burn event while minimizing the inclusion
of symptoms due to other causes.
A unique challenge to designing research on the health
impact of cane burning on Maui is that burning is
intentionally avoided on “voggy” days. Thus, simply
comparing acute symptoms across the Maui population
on burn versus non-burn days does not isolate the im-
pact of cane burning. That is, the higher vog pollution
on non-burn days potentially masks the impact of cane
burning. Therefore, the design must adjust for vog and
other
potential
confounding
factors.
One
approach
would be to select the control, no-burn days, to have
exactly the same vog effect as the burn days. This is
problematic as the declaration of a “vog day” is very sub-
ject and imprecise, depending on observing haze and the
amount and duration of the haze seen. For a given year,
different agencies report varying percentages of vog days
between 5–20 % for Maui. Additionally, associations
with marker chemical pollutant(s) are not well validated.
Therefore, the method used in this study (ratio of ratios)
is more likely to effectively control for confounders that
potentially affect health island-wide by comparing the
ratio of symptoms in exposed versus non-exposed re-
gions on burn versus non-burn days.
Furthermore, it may appear that the lower two quar-
tiles of acreage burned have a “protective effect” where
areas of smoke exposure have proportionately fewer
cases when looking at the trend effect based on acreage.
It is possible that there is an underrepresentation of out-
comes in all quartiles. Perhaps the methods of measur-
ing respiratory distress only captured more acute events,
so that the impact of burning on indicators of milder re-
spiratory distress (e.g., clinic visits, taking a sick day
from work, and/or general malaise) were not measured.
For example, when the smoke exposure is mild (lower
quartiles), respiratory distress symptoms may be milder,
and subjects take a “wait and see” approach hoping that
the symptoms clear with the smoke. This could result in
lower than normal ED visits, hospital admissions, or pre-
scription fills that day. The following day, the symptoms
either clear or result in case outcomes if they don’t re-
solve; thus a lag-effect may exist. Our method only de-
tected symptoms on the day of the burning and would
miss second-day delayed visits and/or more mild distress
if they occurred.
While we controlled for the effect of vog and rain more
likely to occur on non-burn days, our study design can
address other confounders like “healthy survivor” effect
where residents relocate to another part of the island to
avoid the vog as well as disproportionate pharmacy cover-
age across a geographical area. The strength of the meth-
odology is that the adjustments occur without actually
knowing the degree of confounding or even identifying
that a confounder exists. This is analogous to having an
individual be his own control, which adjusts for known
and unknown confounders, measured or not. For small

Page 6 of 8communities requiring a rapid assessment of outdoor pol-
lution sources, this method should be considered. This
method requires that the targeted confounding effect oc-
curs either uniformly geographically (vog, pollen, or mold)
or persists over time (pharmacy coverage, healthy survivor
effect, etc.). An alternative approach to adjusting for con-
founders may involve mathematical modeling (regres-
sions, etc.). In order to do this, one must measure the
confounding effect upon which to build the model. For ef-
fects like vog, this may be difficult since there are a variety
of irritants, acting alone and in combinations, and clinical
effects may persist beyond the actual detection period
of the polluting chemicals in the air. However, our
design of comparing morbidity of self-matched groups
offers a simple way to adjust for confounders without
actually knowing the markers or the magnitude of their
effects. Perhaps a stratified analysis on the matched
case–control pairs would have offered more precision
but it is not clear how much more these statistical
methods would have added [19].
Given the accumulation of data showing the negative
health impact from air pollution in general and sugar
cane burning specifically, public health officials should
consider actions to minimize this impact. This study
suggests that limiting the number of acres burned on a
given day might significantly reduce acute respiratory
distress among those residing in exposed areas. It is
noteworthy that in Brazil, where most of the studies of
sugar cane burning impact have been conducted, one
state has passed a law requiring the gradual elimination
of pre-harvest burning. Preliminary results indicate that
this has resulted in improvements in respiratory health
[15]. While economic interests are often of concern with
such actions, economic evaluations should include all
likely impacts, including cost of associated healthcare,
productivity, and quality of life. On Maui, where tourism
is the dominant economic engine, impact on visitors
should also be considered.
Conclusions
These results provide additional evidence of the harmful
effects of sugar cane burning on respiratory functioning,
specifically a “dose” response based on the number of
acres burned as an indicator of volume of smoke. Maui
is a small island with a complex environment that
includes vog and other potential triggers of respiratory
distress. New technologies may offer better detection of
chemical markers of pollution; however, this study dem-
onstrated that modern technology of satellite mapping
can help control for confounders. While additional
research will advance scientific understanding of the
relationship between air pollution and health, public
health officials should consider taking action based on
the accumulation of research to date.

Abstract 
Background:  Indonesian peatlands have been drained for agricultural development for several decades. This devel‑
opment has made a major contribution to economic development. At the same time, peatland drainage is causing 
significant air pollution resulting from peatland fires. Peatland fires occur every year, even though their extent is 
much larger in dry (El Niño) years. We examine the health effects of long-term exposure to fine particles ­(PM2.5) from 
all types of peatland fires (including the burning of above and below ground biomass) in Sumatra and Kalimantan, 
where most peatland fires in Indonesia take place.
Methods:  We derive ­PM2.5 concentrations from satellite imagery calibrated and validated with Indonesian Gov‑
ernment data on air pollution, and link increases in these concentrations to peatland fires, as observed in satellite 
imagery. Subsequently, we apply available epidemiological studies to relate ­PM2.5 exposure to a range of health 
outcomes. The model utilizes the age distribution and disease prevalence of the impacted population.
Results:  We find that ­PM2.5 air pollution from peatland fires, causes, on average, around 33,100 adults and 2900 
infants to die prematurely each year from air pollution. In addition, peatland fires cause on average around 4390 addi‑
tional hospitalizations related to respiratory diseases, 635,000 severe cases of asthma in children, and 8.9 million lost 
workdays. The majority of these impacts occur in Sumatra because of its much higher population density compared 
to Kalimantan. A main source of uncertainty is in the Concentration Response Functions (CRFs) that we use, with dif‑
ferent CRFs leading to annual premature adult mortality ranging from 19,900 to 64,800 deaths. Currently, the popula‑
tion of both regions is relatively young. With aging of the population over time, vulnerabilities to air pollution and 
health effects from peatland fires will increase.
Conclusions:  Peatland fire health impacts provide a further argument to combat fires in peatlands, and gradually 
transition to peatland management models that do not require drainage and are therefore not prone to fire risks.

Background
Indonesia faces peat and forest fires every year, with the 
most severe fires occurring in El Niño years, including 
2014, 2015 and 2019 [1]. During these events, smoke 
extends over large parts of Indonesia as well as Singapore 
and parts of Malaysia [2]. Much of the smoke is from 
peatland fires. Out of some 15 million hectares of peat 
in Indonesia, over half have been cleared and drained, 
in particular for plantation development (including oil 
palm and acacia for pulp and paper production) [3]. Once 
drained, peatlands are susceptible to fires, which can 
have a significant impact on ambient air quality. Drained, 
but still wet peat soils burn incompletely, at relatively 
low temperatures, which results in relatively high emis-
sions of a mix of pollutants including particulate matter,

carbon monoxide and Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds 
(PACs) [2]. The ­PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter 
less than 2.5 μm) concentrations reached in Indonesia 
during fire events are exceptionally high. For example, 
in 2015 in Central Kalimantan province, 24-h mean con-
centrations above 2000 μg/m3 were recorded [4, 5], far 
above short–term exposure levels considered hazardous 
for human health by the World Health Organization, i.e., 
15 μg/m3 (24 hour mean) [6].
In the epimidiological literature, it has become com-
mon practice to use ­PM2.5 as an indicator of ambient air 
quality, and causal associations between ­PM2.5 exposure 
and health effects have been derived. The health effects of 
particulate air pollution include respiratory and cardio-
vascular morbidity (e.g., aggravation of asthma, respira-
tory symptoms and an increase in hospital admissions) 
and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory dis-
eases as well as contribute to lung cancer [7]. Given 
that forest and peatland fires occur across Indonesia 
each year, and that smoke is retained in the ambient air 
for several months a year, forest and peatland fires not 
only lead to spikes in air pollution over the short-term, 
but also increase the population long-term exposure 
to ­PM2.5, which is known to have a greater impact on 
mortality than short-term episodes [8, 9]. Several stud-
ies have analyzed health effects of Indonesian peat fires. 
For example, the short-term health effects of the 1997 
fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan were studied in [10] 
and the long-term health effects in Central Kalimantan 
province in [11]. Air quality and health impacts of vegeta-
tion and peat fires in Equatorial Asia during 2004–2015 
were studied in a comprehensive modelling study in [12]. 
However none of these studies analysed average long-
term health effects including both mortality and morbid-
ity effects, based on a comprehensive spatial database of 
­PM2.5 concentrations.
The objective of this paper is to analyse the long-term 
health impact of Indonesian peatland fires over the 5 year 
period extending between 2013 and 2017. We focus on 
the lowland provinces of Sumatra and Kalimantan which 
contain extensive peat areas and where people have the 
greatest exposures to the fires. We determine (i) the 
­PM2.5 ambient air pollution resulting from fires occur-
ring in peat; (ii) exposure of people to ­PM2.5; and (iii) the 
resulting heath impacts from long-term exposure includ-
ing adult premature mortality, lost work days, cases of 
childhood asthma and chronic bronchitis, respiratory 
hospital admissions and infant mortality. Our paper 
focusses on Sumatra and Kalimantan where the majority 
of peatland fires take place and where the health effects 
of these fires are the highest. We include all types of fire 
in peatlands including fires affecting above ground veg-
etation and/or fires that occur in the form of burning and 
smouldering of below ground peat biomass. Our meth-
odology is novel in the sense that it focusses on peatland 
fires, and integrates satellite data on air quality, calibrated 
with data from local monitoring stations, with state-of-
the-art epidemiological modelling resulting in a high res-
olution (4.4 km) model for a large area (~ 1 million ­km2). 
We also assess the implications of using different concen-
tration-response functions. We acknowledge that health 
effects of air pollution from peatland fires in Sumatra and 
Kalimantan occur in a broader area including Singapore 
and Malaysia (e.g. [13]), but we focus our study on Indo-
nesia, where the fires originate.
Methods
Case study area
We focus on the health effects of peatland fires in Suma-
tra and Kalimantan, and while peat and forest fires also 
occur in Papua and West Papua provinces, their much 
lower population will result in smaller impacts from 
the fires. Sumatra covers 48 million hectares (ha). With 
around 21% of the Indonesian population, it is the most 
populous island after Java. Sumatra has in total around 
6.4 million ha of peat according to government data [14], 
most of it located along the east coast of the island. Kali-
mantan is the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo 
and covers around 54 million ha. Based on government 
data of the Ministry of Agriculture [14], Kalimantan has 
approximately 4.9 million ha of peatland. Peat occurs in 
all provinces of Kalimantan: South, Central, West, East 
and North Kalimantan. Large scale deforestation and 
peat conversion started in the 1980s, initially in Sumatra. 
In recent years it has slowed down in response to govern-
ment policies, but peat conversion is still ongoing in par-
ticular for the cultivation of oil palm. The peat extent, and 
land cover in the peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan 
are shown in Fig. 1. Peatland fires typically occur in the 
dry season – starting in June and extending to December 
in some parts of Indonesia – with most fires taking place 
in the period from August to October.
Peatland fire occurrence
The burned areas in Sumatra and Kalimantan in each year 
from 2013 to 2017 were derived from satellite imagery 
collected through MODIS (MCD64A1 Collection 6). The 
MODIS MCD64A1 product uses a burned area map-
ping algorithm to detect changes in vegetation using the 
optical MODIS sensors [16], providing daily data with 
a 500 m grid resolution. Daily MODIS MCD64A1 data 
were downloaded as shapefiles, aggregated by year, and 
overlaid with the Government of Indonesia Ministry of 
Agriculture peat map from 2011 [14], in order to iden-
tify which fires took place in areas that have peat soils 
(as opposed to mineral soils). The number of fires variedPage 3 of 16
Hein et al. Environmental Health           (2022) 21:62 
	
considerably between years, with over 100,000 individual 
fires recorded during the particularly dry year 2015.
In order to specify the type of land cover where the 
burned areas were identified, the results were subse-
quently overlaid with the land cover maps of the Ministry 
of Environment and Forestry from 2013 to 2017. These 
land cover maps show the spatial extent of 22 classes of 
land cover, which are aggregated here into five broad cat-
egories: 1) forests (intact and degraded peat swamp for-
est); 2) plantation (including oil palm, hevea rubber and 
coconut) and forest plantation; 3) degraded lands (bare 
ground, wet/dry shrubs, savannas, and grassy areas); 4) 
agricultural lands; and 5) other categories. For each of 
these classes, emission factors were calculated, in order 
to estimate which proportion of ambient ­PM2.5 is derived 
from fires in peatland (discussed below). All spatial anal-
yses were conducted in the ArcMap 10.5 GIS package.
Ambient ­PM2.5 from peatland fires
Estimating ambient ­PM2.5 concentrations from satellites 
and simulation
Due to the limited availability of ground measurements 
of ­PM2.5 in Indonesia, we use estimates of surface ­PM2.5 
concentrations derived from a combination of satellite 
remote sensing and chemical transport model simula-
tion [17]. Monthly estimates of surface ­PM2.5 concentra-
tions are derived over Sumatra and Kalimantan for 2013 
to 2017 at a spatial grid resolution of 4.4 km. ­PM2.5 con-
centrations are estimated using satellite-derived Aerosol 
Optical Depth (AOD). AOD is a measure of the extinc-
tion (through scattering and absorption) of light by 
aerosols in a column of air from the Earth’s surface up 
to space. The AOD is used to represent the abundance 
of total aerosol particles in an atmospheric column [18]. 
The daily surface ­PM2.5 concentrations from each data 
source are obtained by applying the daily simulated AOD 
to ­PM2.5 ratios to the coincident daily calibrated AOD 
sources (see Supplementary Materials). Monthly means 
are calculated from the daily ­PM2.5 values. The monthly 
mean ­PM2.5 concentrations from each source are then 
combined based on their relative uncertainties with AER-
ONET following [17]. Details are presented in the Sup-
plementary Materials. Modelled ­PM2.5 concentrations, 
from AOD, are calibrated with ­PM2.5 and ­PM10 data from 
Indonesia’s air quality monitoring network, that com-
prises 16 stations in Sumatra and 13 stations in Kalim-
antan, providing daily data from 2015 to 2017 (operated 
by the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysical 
Agency and the Ministry of Environment and Forestry) 
[19, 20]. The majority (90%) of PM emitted from peatland 
fires is in the fine particulate fraction ­(PM2.5) [2].
Identifying the contribution of peatland fires to ambient 
­PM2.5
The MODIS data show that fires almost exclusively take 
place in the period June to December. The Indonesian 
dry season varies somewhat between the southern part of 
Kalimantan and the northern part of Sumatra, but gen-
erally lasts from May to October. Hence, the peat burns 
in the dry season as well as in the beginning of the wet 
season, especially in El Nino years such as 2015 when 
major parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan were unusually

and peat extent is from the Ministry of Agriculture [14]Page 4 of 16

dry from September to November [21]. Consequently, 
in Sumatra and Kalimantan, the months with high ­PM2.5 
concentration in the peat areas (above 50 μg/m3) are all 
during the period June to December, with the highest 
exposures occurring during the months from August to 
October (August being the peak of the dry season). This 
is contrary to Java, which is much more industrialized 
and more densely populated, and where concentrations 
exceeding 50 μg/m3 occur throughout the year. Note that, 
due to prevailing wind directions during the dry season, 
the peatland fire smoke generally does not reach Java 
[22]. Hence, we assume that the increment in the ­PM2.5 
concentration during the dry season, that we observe 
throughout Kalimantan and Sumatra, can be attributed 
to fires. To make sure all dry season peatland fires are 
included in the analysis, based on the rainfall distribu-
tion over the years of the analysis, the peat fire season 
is defined, for the purpose of this analysis, as the period 
between June and December. The period January to May 
is defined as the wet season, where we assume there are 
no peat fires. For each province, the mean concentration 
during the peat fire season and during the wet season is 
calculated. The difference between these two is assumed 
to represent the contribution of biomass fires to ambi-
ent ­PM2.5. This difference is then multiplied by 7/12 to 
calculate the annual average increase in ­PM2.5 concen-
tration, which we use to quantify the health impact of 
peatland fires. This is because we relate health effects 
to the mean annual increase in ­PM2.5 as a consequence 
of peatland fires, in line with the epidemiological evi-
dence that the health effects of long-term exposure 
are much more important than the impacts from peak 
exposure [8, 9]. The outcome of the analysis is not sensi-
tive to the assumed length of the peat fire season. If it is 
assumed that the peat fire season is 6 months, for exam-
ple, a higher monthly average increase during this season 
would be noticed, but this would be multiplied with 6/12, 
resulting in approximately the same annual increase in 
ambient ­PM2.5 due to peatland fires.
Next, we analyze which part of the incremental ­PM2.5 
can be attributed to fires in peatlands, as opposed to 
­PM2.5 originating from fires occurring in ecosystems on 
mineral soil (for instance from forest fires or the burn-
ing of biomass in crop fields). For each island, we assume 
that the increase in the concentration of ­PM2.5 from peat-
land fires is proportional to the share of ­PM2.5 emitted in 
peatland fires as opposed to ­PM2.5 emitted from fires on 
mineral soils. We estimate this proportion based on the 
number of hectares burned in peat versus mineral soil, 
taking into consideration differences between years, type 
of ecosystem and emission factors (EF). We acknowledge 
that the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) 
may differ between peatland and forest fires, but we have 
not taken this difference into consideration in the analy-
sis. We comment on the consequences of our simplifi-
cation in the Discussion section. The burned areas are 
analyzed with MODIS images. The location of the fires is 
compared to the land cover map of MOEF [23], and the 
national peat map [14]. The amount of biomass burned 
(above ground biomass and, in peat soil, soil biomass) per 
hectare was analysed for various ecosystem types (for-
ests, plantations, shrubland, grassland and cropland). It 
was assumed that on average peat soils burn to a depth of 
33 cm, and that per hectare of burned peat 505 t of under-
ground biomass is lost [23–25]. The resulting EF for peat 
is 4.6 t ­PM2.5 per hectare burned [26]. For above ground 
biomass, the EF ranges from 0.03 t ­PM2.5 per hectare for 
fires in agricultural land to 3.5 t ­PM2.5 per hectare for 
fires in forests [27, 28]). It is assumed that these numbers 
apply to both ecosystems on peat and on mineral soil. For 
peatland we add the ­PM2.5 emissions from peat burning 
(below ground) to the emissions from above ground bio-
mass burning to calcuate the overall EF. Supplementary 
Materials (SM) Table A2 in the Annex provides detailed 
calculations.
Finally, for each province, month and year the popu-
lation weighted increase in ­PM2.5 concentration due to 
peatland fires was calculated. This is important since 
the populations are not homogeneously distributed 
across provinces, and, consequently, the spatially aver-
age concentrations do not correlate perfectly with the 
true population exposure. We used population data from 
the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center 
(SEDAC), file: Gridded Population of the World 2015.1 
This dataset contains population data at 1 km grid cell 
resolution, world-wide. In our analysis, for every grid 
cell, the increase in ­PM2.5 concentration in the grid cell 
is multiplied with the population in the grid cell. Next, 
these numbers are added for all grid cells in a province, 
and the resulting number is divided by the number of 
people in the province. This results in the population-
weighted average increase in ­PM2.5 concentration due to 
peatland fires by province.
Health effects from peatland fires
We follow a health impact assessment approach to cal-
culate the health effects of peatland fires from long-
term exposure (1-year or longer) to ­PM2.5 ambient air 
concentrations. We did not specifically calculate the

itly included in the epidemiological assessment of the

average long-term health consequences. When analyzing 
the impact of ­PM2.5 on human health, four main inputs 
are used to quantify effects on people: (1) current and 
counterfactual ­PM2.5 concentrations to determine the 
change in ­PM2.5; (2) size and age-composition of popula-
tion groups exposed to current levels of air pollution; (3) 
baseline incidence of mortality and morbidity outcomes; 
and (4) risk functions relating a change in concentration 
to a change in the health outcome of interest. We analyze 
the annual average health effects of peatland fires, relat-
ing annual average health effects to annual average ­PM2.5 
concentrations (in line with, e.g., [8, 9, 29, 30]. In reality, 
variation between years may occur since peak concentra-
tions in ­PM2.5 that exacerbate health effects in the short 
term occur more frequently in dry years with more peat-
land fires. To capture the variability of the impact results, 
we also conduct a sensitivity analysis to the key input 
factors in the analysis, as described below. The health 
impact is calculated as follows:
Current and counterfactual ­PM2.5 concentrations
The health impacts of air pollution related to peatland 
fires are compared to the health effects of air pollu-
tion that would occur without peatland fires (in which 
case there would still be a certain level of air pollution, 
e.g. from industry or traffic). This background air pollu-
tion concentration is referred to as the “counterfactual”, 
the ambient air concentration that would be expected in 
the absence of peatland fires, and the dry season excess 
exposure above the counterfactual is used to evaluate 
the excess health impact attributed to peatland fires. 
In the assessment of the long-term adult mortality, the 
incremental ­PM2.5 from peatland fires is defined as the 
5-year average of the population-weighted, province-
specific concentrations from June to December (fire 
season) minus the concentrations from January to May 
(the counterfactual). On the other hand, infant mortality 
and morbidity impacts are calculated based on the mean 
­PM2.5 incremental exposure above the counterfactual in a 
given year.
Size and age composition of population groups exposed 
to current levels of ­PM2.5
For each province in Sumatra and Kalimantan, annual 
population statistics, including size and age-group strati-
fication, were calculated according to the Indonesian 
Statistics Agency and Bappenas population scenario 
[31]. In 2013, the population of Sumatra and Kaliman-
tan was 53.5 and 15.0 million persons, with an average 
annual population growth rate between 2013 and 2017 
Health Impact = Exposed population × Background rate of mortality or morbility × Health risk function, CRF
× Change in pollution
equal to 1.2 and 1.5% for each region, respectively. The 
average population composition over the 5-year period 
by broad age-group including infants, children (ages 1 to 
14 years), young adults (15 to 30 years) and adults older 
than 30 years was 2.2, 27.7, 26.2, and 43.9%. Age structure 
was similar for both islands.
Baseline rates of mortality
Next, we estimate the underlying rate of the health effect 
(e.g., the baseline natural mortality rate, excluding acci-
dental deaths, in the population in terms of deaths per 
thousand people). We found two sources for these data, 
so a sensitivity analysis was conducted. For the base case, 
the data used were taken from the Global Health Esti-
mates (GHE) database by WHO [32], which provides 
all-cause and cause-specific mortality estimates based 
on official Indonesian national statistics as of year 2016 
(the last year available for such data). For year 2016, 
the GHE indicates 12.56 natural deaths per 1000 adults 
aged 30 and older, and 9.53 deaths for non-communi-
cable diseases and lower respiratory illness combined 
(NCD + LRI) per 1000 adults 25 and older in Indonesia. 
These baseline mortality rates have been applied, with-
out further adjustment, to population estimates from 
the Bappenas population scenario for each of the 5 years 
between 2013 and 2017 to calculate the annual baseline 
mortality [31]. For infant (< 1 year) mortality, modeled 
data were obtained from the United Nations Inter-agency 
Group for Child Mortality Estimation [33]. The annual 
infant mortality rate in Indonesia over the period 2013 to 
2017 was: 25.25, 24.34, 23.46, 22.62, and 21.86 deaths per 
1000 live births. These data were used in the calculation 
of the annual infant mortality.
For the sensitivity calculations, we used modeled 
demographic data from the Global Health Data exchange 
(GHDx) database of the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation.2 At the national-level, IHME estimates for 
year 2016 are 11.09 natural deaths per 1000 adults over 
30 years, and 8.42 NCD + LRI deaths per 1000 adults 
aged 25 and over. Infant mortality figures are fairly close 
to the values by the UN IGME [33]. The IHME database 
also provides modeled mortality rates by province (e.g., 
Aceh, West Kalimantan, etc.). For Sumatra and Kalim-
antan islands, respectively, the mortality rates are 5.50 
and 6.41 natural deaths per 1000 population (compared

to 6.71 per 1000 at the national-level from WHO’s GHE 
database), 10.05 and 11.40 natural deaths per 1000 adults 
over 30 years, and 7.56 and 8.49 NCD + LRI deaths per 
1000 adults 25 and over.
Concentration‑response functions
The fourth input is based on statistical relationships 
from the epidemiological literature that relate ambient 
concentrations of ­PM2.5 to mortality and other health 
effects. Over the past decades, epidemiological studies 
on biomass-derived PM have investigated the mortality 
and morbidity effects of wildfires on respiratory and car-
diovascular outcomes [34–36];;. While the toxicological 
evidence is suggestive that wildfire PM is more toxic than 
urban PM, we have adopted the conservative assumption 
that all particles are equitoxic, and have applied in our 
analysis the most robust CRFs recently derived on the 
basis of all PM sources. The accuracy of the risk functions 
depends in part on: (a) the data quality and methodology 
of the original studies; (b) the extent to which the con-
centration-response functions (CRF) include the range of 
concentrations for which they are being applied, and (c) 
the applicability of these functions to populations besides 
those from which they were originally estimated.
For the base-case health assessment of adult mortality 
from exposure to ambient ­PM2.5 resulting from peatland 
fires, a meta-analysis was used [30]. This study included 
53 cohort studies, 39 studies from North America, eight 
from Europe, and six from Asia. The mean concentra-
tion of ­PM2.5 across the studies was 15.7 μg/m3, with 
higher concentrations observed in the Asian studies with 
a mean of 30.5 μg/m3. The authors’ analysis indicated 
robust association between ­PM2.5 and premature mor-
tality. At the mean concentration of 15.7 μg/m3, a 10 μg/
m3 increase in ­PM2.5 was associated with a 10.3% (95% 
confidence interval (CI) = 9.7, 11.1%) increase in adult 
premature mortality. This risk function was used for the 
base case estimates since it included the greatest number 
of studies in total, with a few from Asia. The referenced 
health risk was applied to the mortality rate in the popu-
lation over 30 years old [30].
A sensitivity analysis was performed by using three 
alternative concentration-response functions. The first 
is an estimate of adult mortality; a meta-analysis of 41 
cohort studies from around the world that was con-
ducted while allowing for flexibility in determining the 
shape of the CRF [9]. The second study [37], utilized 
census data on 2.4 million Canadian adults to examine 
non-accidental and cause-specific mortality between 
2001 and 2011. Of particular interest, the study com-
pared impacts of using three different average exposure 
periods (1, 3, and 8 years), so it is relevant to the five-
year average of concentrations due to peatland fires. 
The health risk from [37] was applied to the mortality 
rate in the population over 30 years old. The third study 
used in the sensitivity analysis is based on the recom-
mendations from WHO’s HRAPIE revie w[7], which 
was based primarily on an earlier meta-analysis [8]. 
The estimated risk for non-accidental mortality (for the 
population 30+) was based on eleven studies available 
at the time. The resulting risk was 6.2% (95% CI = 4, 
8.2%) per 10 μg/m3 increment in ­PM2.5 concentra-
tion. As shown in Annex 2, the CRF that we use in our 
base case [30], lies in between those of the three other 
studies.
Infant mortality (age < 1 year) was assessed based on 
[38]. This study considered almost 1 million births across 
sub-Saharan Africa using the Demographic and Health 
Surveys, a set of nationally representative samples from 
30 sub-Saharan countries. ­PM2.5 was estimated at the 
residential location using remote sensing satellite data 
and assigned to each birth using exposures 9 months 
before and 12 months after birth. The study reported 
that a 10 μg/m3 change in ­PM2.5 was associated with 9.2% 
(95% CI = 4, 14%) increase in infant mortality. Previous 
studies in Mexico City [39, 40] generated risk estimates 
of 8.8 and 6.9%, respectively, for a 10 μg/m3 change in 
­PM2.5. Finally, another large meta-analysis [41], included 
over a half million births from 69 nationally representa-
tive Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 43 
countries throughout Africa, the Middle East, Asia, East-
ern Europe and the Caribbean. The study suggests an 
increase in infant mortality of 8.1% (95% CI = 2.5, 14.3%) 
for a 10 μg/m3 change in fire-related ­PM2.5, which is quite 
similar to the result of [38].
For morbidity, based on available data, the follow-
ing were quantified: severe asthma attacks in children, 
asthma-related hospital admissions (all ages), all res-
piratory hospital admissions (all ages), and lost work 
days for the current labor force. Thus, outcomes such 
as cardiovascular morbidity (heart attacks, hospital 
admissions), respiratory symptoms leading to restricted 
activity and adverse birth outcomes (besides infant 
mortality) were not quantified because of uncertain-
ties regarding baseline levels in Sumatra and Kaliman-
tan. Most of the CRFs were based on WHO’s HRAPIE 
[7], except one study [42], which was used for asthma-
related hospital admissions. Baseline prevalence rates 
were determined as follows: severe child asthma attacks 
were assumed to be 1.24 cases/year per child, assum-
ing 62 asthma attacks a year, of which 2% are severe 
([7, 43];, respiratory hospital admissions were assumed 
as 397 per 100,000 people [44],and lost work days were 
7 days/worker (UN ILO). For asthma-related hospital 
admissions, we were unable to find baseline evidence 
for Indonesia, instead, we used evidence from Europe,Page 7 of 16

and assumed that 11% of all respiratory hospital admis-
sions are asthma-related.
Results
Peatland fire occurrence
Between 2013 and 2017, peatland fires occurred every 
year in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Table  1), with the 
largest burned areas detected in 2014 (0.72 million ha) 
and 2015 (0.42 million ha). The three provinces with 
the largest burned areas were: Riau, Central Kaliman-
tan and South Sumatra. On average, over the period 
2013–2017, 2.3% of all peatlands in Sumatra and 3.0% 
of all peatlands in Kalimantan burned each year. How-
ever, there were large variations between years. For 
instance, in 2014, 5.4% of all peatlands burned in Suma-
tra, and 7.8% in Kalimantan. Within the peatlands, 
most fires occurred in degraded lands (bare ground, 
wet and dry shrub, savanna and grassland), totaling 52 
to 80% of total burned areas annually, followed by plan-
tations (6 to 37%), agricultural lands (3 to 13%) and for-
ests (including primary and degraded forest) (4 to 10%; 
see Annex 1, Table A1, for details). The largest fires in 
degraded lands occurred in 2014 and 2015 when 0.46 
million ha and 0.34 million ha of degraded peatlands 
were burned, respectively.
Ambient ­PM2.5 from peatland fires
The monthly satellite-derived (SAT) surface ­PM2.5 con-
centration estimates for Indonesia are compared against 
monthly ground monitor data (Insitu) in Table  2. The 
comparison is shown for ‘All Sites’ (direct ­PM2.5 sites and 
the sites where ­PM2.5 is calculated from ­PM10), and for 
direct ­PM2.5 sites (Direct ­PM2.5 Sites). The ground meas-
urements only cover the period of 2014 to 2017. The 
majority of the ground-based observations over Indone-
sia provided ­PM10 concentrations rather than ­PM2.5. The 
­PM10 measurements were used to estimate ­PM2.5, based 
on sites where there were coincident ­PM2.5 and ­PM10 val-
ues. The column ‘All Sites’ in Table 2 contains the analysis 
for all sites (the sites measuring directly ­PM2.5 values as 
well as the sites where ­PM2.5 was estimated from ­PM10), 
while the column ‘Direct ­PM2.5 Sites’ is referring to the 
analysis for only sites which directly measured ­PM2.5.
There is a high degree of consistency (R2  = 0.77 for 
all sites; R2  = 0.90 for direct ­PM2.5 sites) between the 
­PM2.5 estimates and the independent ground moni-
tor data, with slopes of 0.78 for all sites and 1.07 for 
direct ­PM2.5 sites and no significant differences in 
performance between Kalimantan and Sumatra. The 
mean satellite-derived ­PM2.5 over the entire 2014–2017 
period (33.81 μg/m3 for all sites; 33.53 μg/m3 for direct 
­PM2.5 sites) demonstrate a good agreement with the 
mean ground monitor ­PM2.5 (28.39 μg/m3 for all sites; 
24.39 μg/m3 for direct ­PM2.5 sites). This comparison 
with ground monitor data indicates that the satellite-
derived ­PM2.5 estimates are accurately capturing the 
high ­PM2.5 concentrations associated with biomass 
burning events, and can be used with a high degree of 
confidence for estimating the impacts of ­PM2.5 due to 
biomass burning over Indonesia.
Figure 2 (A) showsthe 2013–2017 average ­PM2.5 con-
centrations for the core fire season (months of August 
to October) and (B) all other months in Sumatra and

ent predominantly in the fire season, in particular in the 
southeastern part of Sumatra (Riau, Jambi and South 
Sumatra provinces) and in the provinces of Central and 
West Kalimantan

Figure 3 shows how ­PM2.5 concentrations vary across 
the year, indicating both the 5-year average and the 
concentrations for a dry (2015) and wet (2016) year. 
During the fire season (June to December), average 
­PM2.5 concentrations in Sumatra and Kalimantan reach 
almost 60 μg/m3 (with a maximum monthly average 
­PM2.5 concentration of 143 μg/m3 in October 2015), 
while for the non-fire season months, average concen-
trations are around 20 μg/m3. Note that these maps 
show PM concentrations as determined by all emis-
sion sources including fires on peat and mineral land, 
industry, traffic, etc. The difference between the aver-
age ­PM2.5 concentration during the 5 months wet sea-
son (the ‘counterfactual’) and the 7 months dry season 
is assumed to be the contribution of biomass burning 
comprising both fires in areas with a mineral soil and in 
areas with a peat soil.
Supplementary Materials Table A5 presents the con-
tribution of peatland fires to the overall ­PM2.5 emission 
from biomass burning. On average, over 5 years, this 
contribution is 76% in Kalimantan and 86% in Suma-
tra. Subsequently, the population-weighted exposure to 
­PM2.5 from peatland fires by province and by year are 
calculated. This is shown in Table  3. The table shows 
the average ­PM2.5 exposure of people living in each 
province.
Health effects from peatland fires
Health impacts of fires in Indonesian peatlands, in 
Sumatra and Kalimantan, are shown in Fig. 4. Using the 
CRF curve of [30], each year around 33,100 adults (95% 
CI = 31,200, 35,700) and around 2900 infants die prema-
turely because of air pollution resulting from peatland 
fires. This mortality rate corresponds to around 10% of 
total adult mortality (over 30 years old) in Sumatra and 
Kalimantan and 7.7% of the annual infant mortality. For 
a different perspective, the loss of life expectancy due 
to peatland fires at birth per inhabitant in Sumatra and

Kalimantan is, respectively, 0.9 and 1.2 years (life expec-
tancy at birth is around 71 years). These estimates were 
calculated using a life table analysis [45], considering 
province-specific data on the population and mortality 
distribution by age group (sourced from IHME’s GHDx 
database). In addition to premature deaths, we calculate 
the morbidity incidences related to smoke inhalation. On 
average, for each year between 2013 and 2017, our analy-
sis has identified an additional 4390 respiratory hospital 
admissions, 635 thousand severe asthma symptom days 
among asthmatic children, and 8.9 million workdays lost 
in the working population.

Discussion
Uncertainties
Our study is the most comprehensive analysis of the 
long-term health effects of peatland fires in Indonesia 
carried out to date, in terms of the spatial and temporal 
cover and the application of CRFs to analyse the adult 
long-term mortality, infant deaths, and the additional 
morbidity effects associated with smoke inhalation 
in the exposed population. This improved knowledge 
leads to a better understanding of the negative health 
effects linked to peat drainage. Nevertheless, the anal-
ysis is subject to several important sources of uncer-
tainty, related to both data and the models that we use. 
In terms of data, the main uncertainties pertain to: 
(i) the areas covered by peatlands; (ii) the occurrence 
of fires; and (iii) the estimation of ­PM2.5. In the last 
20 years, 5 studies have published estimates of peatland 
occurrence in Sumatra and Kalimantan (for an over-
view, see [46]). For Sumatra, these estimates range from 
5.6 million ha [47], to 9.6 million ha [48]. For Kalim-
antan, estimates range from 4.8 million ha [14] to 6.7 
million ha [47]. In this study, the numbers of [14], are 
used, in line with the numbers formally adopted by the 
Government of Indonesia. Based on these numbers, 
the contribution of peatland fires to overall ­PM2.5 emit-
ted from fires is estimated at 86% in Sumatra (average 
over 2013–217, range: 75% in 2017 to 94% in 2013) and 
76% in Kalimantan (range: 62% in 2016 to 88% in 2013). 
This result is comparable to Kiely et al. [49], who esti-
mate that, across Indonesia, peatland fires contributed 
71% of total ­PM2.5 emissions from fires in Indonesia 
during September–October 2015. Our study focusses 
on two islands with extensive peat areas, which can 
explain why we find somewhat higher values. However, 
the uncertainty in peat area means for our study that 
there is uncertainty in the attribution of ­PM2.5 to peat-
land fires (as opposed to fires in mineral soil). Since the 
numbers on peat extent that we use are relatively low 
[14], we may underestimate the contribution of peat-
land fires to overall increases in ­PM2.5, and thereby 
underestimate the associated health effects.
Next, there is uncertainty regarding the occurrence of 
fires as measured with MODIS. The MODIS MCD64A1 
product presents an estimate of the area burned in a 
given time period, however it is likely to underreport 
the actual burned area. In particular, small, burned 
areas (less than 100 ha) and burned areas in croplands 
and degraded grasslands are not all registered [16]. The 
estimates of burned areas presented in this report are 
subject to these same uncertainties. As for the measure-
ment of ­PM2.5, we are combining ground observations of 
­PM2.5 from the Government of Indonesia with models of 
ambient ­PM2.5 based on remote sensing observations. As 
explained in Section 3.2, our model has a good fit with 
the observed data, having an ­R2 of 0.90 with ­PM2.5 meas-
urement stations and an ­R2 = 0.77 for all sites. However, 
we apply a simplification in the allocation of ­PM2.5 emis-
sions to peatland fire versus forest fires on mineral land. 
In particular, we do not consider SOA formation in dis-
tinguishing the ratio ­PM2.5 from peatland fires versus for-
est fires. The incomplete burning of peat soils means that 
SOA formation may, on a per hectare basis, be higher in 
peatlands compared to forests on mineral land (e.g. [49]). 
Furtheromore, the EF we use for peat combustion (9.04 g/
Fig. 4  Health impacts of Indonesian peatland fires, based on a CRF curve of [30]Page 11 of 16

kg) is conservative. Other studies which have done field 
measurements have found up to 29.6 g/kg [50] and 22.3 g/
kg [51]. Both aspects mean that we may underestimate 
the amount of ambient ­PM2.5 resulting from peatland 
fires (and overestimate the ­PM2.5 resulting from for-
est fires on mineral land). This means we may therefore 
underestimate the health effects of peatland fires.
In terms of health impact models, a key source of 
uncertainty lies in the selection of the concentration 
response functions that we use to assess health effects, 
and in our underlying input data assumptions. A first 
important assumption that we make is that the exposure 
to ­PM2.5, as measured over the period 2013–2017, is rep-
resentative for the long-term exposure in Sumatra and 
Kalimantan. The period we study has two dry years (2014, 
2015) two wet years (2016, 2017) and a year with average 
rainfall (2013). This can be considered representative for 
long-term rainfall conditions. Another key assumption 
is that ­PM2.5 emissions from other sources, in particular 
transportation, industry, energy supply and households, 
are similar in magnitude during the wet and dry sea-
son, so that the total increase in the dry season can be 
attributed to fires. There is no reason to assume any of 
these sources emits significantly more ­PM2.5 in the dry 
season compared to the wet season, however we cannot 
exclude that this may be the case. Furthermore, it may be 
that different rainfall patterns in the dry and wet season 
influence the rate at which ­PM2.5 is removed from the 
atmosphere affecting our assumption that the difference 
between the dry and the wet season ­PM2.5 concentrations 
can be solely attributed to biomass burning. The ­PM2.5 
data for the year 2016, the year with the fewest peatland 
fires, show that the associated error is likely to be small 
(see Fig. 3). For 2016, the average Jan to May = 16.75 μg/
m3, average Jan to Jul = 16.36 μg/m3, and average Jan to 
Dec = 16.66 μg/m3 – in other words, the year with the 
least peatland fires experienced fairly constant average 
­PM2.5 concentrations throughout the year. An additional, 
important assumption is that a peak in ­PM2.5 concentra-
tion during the dry season can be averaged out over the 
year in order to assess health impacts; in other words that 
the health effects of a seasonal peak in ­PM2.5 are similar 
to those of a (lower) annual average increase in ­PM2.5. 
Since we are analyzing the long-term impacts of ­PM2.5 
exposure, we believe the resulting potential errror to be 
small, and we note that this assumption is also made in 
various other studies analyzing the health impacts of for-
est fires, e.g. [42, 52]. Finally, we assume that the human 
toxicity of ­PM2.5 derived from peatland fires is in line with 
the average toxicity of ­PM2.5 (as related to health effects 
in concentration-response curves world-wide). However, 
various studies indicate that ­PM2.5 from biomass burn-
ing is relatively toxic, compared to other sources of ­PM2.5 
such as road dust or aerosols from sea salt spray [53, 54].
Furthermore, there is uncertainty related to applying 
concentration-response curves to Indonesia, in par-
ticular because many of the underlying data are from 
Western Europe and the US, even though the study that 
we used for our base case estimate, [30], also includes 
data from China. This is reflected in the spread of the 
values that we present in Table 4. The accuracy of the 
application depends on the similarity of factors such as: 
(a) the chemical composition of the ­PM2.5; (b) the activ-
ity patterns and time spent outdoors; (c) underlying 
population disease profile and health status, including 
availability and utilization of health care services; (d) 
socioeconomic status; (e) age distribution, and (f) expo-
sure to other pollutants, both outdoors and indoors. Of 
particular relevance is that Indonesia’s population is 
much younger and hospital admissions are much lower 
compared to the US and Western Europe. In addition, 
Indonesia and many other low- and middle-income 
countries have a different proportion of communicable 
diseases (around 16% of natural deaths) than the U.S. 
and Western Europe (around 5–6%). To explore the 
implications of using different CRFs, Table 4 below pre-
sents a sensitivity analysis, using three different choices 
for the CRF, with further details provided in Table A1.5 
in the SM.
Finally, we need to stress that a limitation of our anal-
ysis is that we only examine premature mortality and 
morbidity effects of peatlands fires in Sumatra and Kali-
mantan. In years with severe fires, such as 2014 and 2015, 
smoke from peatland fires is spread over considerably 
larger areas, including other islands of Indonesia, Malay-
sia, Singapore and even parts of Thailand. Even though

the health effects are concentrated in the two islands that 
we examine, mortality and morbidity effects do occur 
in other areas, both as a consequence of peatland fires 
in Sumatra and Kalimantan and due to peatland fires in 
other areas (e.g. Papua and Sulawesi) [55–57]. Conse-
quently, our numbers are an underestimate of the overall 
health effects of peatland fires in Indonesia.
Our results can be compared to two other stud-
ies that assessed the health effects of peatland fires in 
Sumatra and Kalimantan. Crippa et  al. [56] find that 
short-term exposure to air pollution resulting from 
peat fires in 2015 may have caused 11,880 (6153–
17,270) excess mortalities across SE Asia and state that 
“the estimated deaths represent only a fraction of the 
overall premature fatalities due to long-term exposure 
to unhealthy air quality conditions”. They estimate that 
~ 75,600 excess premature mortality would occur each 
year if the population received long-term exposure to 
the pollutant concentrations experienced in fall 2015 
[56]. Kiely et al. (2020) [12] analysed excess mortality 
from health effects related to peat fires in six dry years 
with extensive peat fires in the period 2004 to 2015. 
For 2015, they found that exposure to PM resulted in 
44,040 excess deaths in SE Asia, of which 61% (about 
27,000 deaths) occurred in Sumatra and Kalimantan 
[12]. Our estimate for 2015 is 45,300 premature deaths 
across Sumatra and Kalimantan due to peatland fires, 
a value that is halfway between the estimate of the 
two studies [12, 55]. A main factor driving the differ-
ences between the studies is the counterfactual, i.e. the 
amount of ­PM2.5 that is added to the background ­PM2.5 
concentration due to peatland fires (for instance, [12] 
assumed this to be 25 μg/m3, whereas our counterfac-
tual is 18 μg/m3), but also differences in input data such 
as share of total ­PM2.5 emissions from peatland com-
pared to other fires, population exposure-level, and 
demographic data play a role.
Policy implications
The use and management of Indonesian peatlands is 
challenging. Peatlands cover large areas (between 15 
and 20 million ha), often located in remote areas, in 
particular in Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. These 
peatlands are an important economic asset, given that 
they can be used for agriculture [47, 58, 59]. At present, 
only small areas of peatlands are being used for crops 
that do not require drainage, such as sago. The drain-
age of peatlands for other crops brings significant nega-
tive externalities. In addition to adverse health effects 
from peatland fires, these include ­CO2 emissions, loss 
of biodiversity, and soil subsidence that will, over time, 
increase flood risks across Indonesian lowlands [60–
62]. Importantly, fire occurrence in 2016 and 2017 was 
markedly lower, which may be related to higher rain-
fall in 2016 and 2017, compared to 2014 and 2015. Fire 
occurrence increased again in 2019 [63].
We show that the health effects of draining and con-
verting peatlands for agricultural development are 
substantial. Annual premature adult mortality due 
to peatland fires ranges from 19,900 to 64,800 cases, 
depending upon the concentration-response curve 
used (Table 4). Clearly, also the lower end of the model 
results indicates a substantial health effect attributable 
to peatland fires (6% of adult natural mortality). Fur-
thermore, peatland fires put additional stress on the 
country’s health care system, and result in lost workdays 
due to air pollution related sicknesses. Both aspects 
are economic costs for Indonesia. There have also been 
reports that reduced lung functioning due to air pollu-
tion increases population vulnerability to COVID-19 
[64]. The relation between COVID-19 and air pollution 
from peat and forest fires remains to be further studied, 
but this may provide further policy incentive to address 
peatland fires.
The Indonesian government has already banned 
farmers from dry-season crop residue burning, and 
such efforts are very important in mitigating health 
risks. In addition, health risks should be considered 
in land use planning and decision making on peatland 
uses. It is relevant to consider in which land use types 
the fires predominantly take place. Our data show that 
the least fire-prone areas are forests, which under nat-
ural conditions burn very seldomly (0.1% of the forest 
land burns each year, an average over the period 2013–
2017, in Sumatra and Kalimantan; part of this land is 
burned deliberately to clear space for agriculture). On 
the other end of the spectrum, each year some 4% of 
agricultural lands and some 6% of grasslands burn. For-
est plantations and perennial (plantation) crops take 
an intermediate position; some 2% is burned each year 
on average across Sumatra and Kalimantan. Around 
61% of ­PM2.5 emissions related to biomass are from 
grasslands and shrublands, and 23% from plantations 
(annual croplands cover a much smaller area and con-
tribute only 7%).
To reduce fire risks and associated health effects, a 
first priority is the rehabilitation of degraded grass-
lands and shrublands in peat, involving rewetting, 
revegetating, and controlling fire, cf. [65]. Second, in 
the near to medium term, there is a need to phase out 
oil palm, acacia, coconut and other crops on peat that 
require drainage, and replace these by other peatland 
uses that do not require drainage. It is noted that low 
water tables in plantations extend to adjacent areas 
[66]; drainage for plantations desiccates adjacent areas 
up to several km from the plantation boundary. Hence,Page 13 of 16
Hein et al. Environmental Health           (2022) 21:62 
	
drainage in plantations also increases fire risks in 
other land use types in peat including in forests and 
grasslands.
In the future, fire risks from plantation agriculture 
in peat involving drainage will only increase. Drainage 
leads to soil subsidence. As shown in [67], most drained 
plantations in peat have an expected lifecycle of 1 to 3 
rotations (25 to 75 years) before they are subsided to 
the level that seasonal flooding kills the trees (both oil 
palm and acacia are sensitive to high water tables). Sub-
sequently, the plantation will be abandoned. Abandoned 
plantations have a very high fire risk: their drained sta-
tus and ample dead biomass mean fires will propagate 
quickly in the dry season. When the area covered by 
abandoned plantations increases in the coming decades, 
fire risks will further increase. This again points to the 
need to develop new plantation models in peat, using 
paludiculture (no drainage) crops such as sago [46]. This 
should be done as soon as possible, before ongoing peat 
subsidence and increasing flood and fire risks constrain 
the possibilities for paludiculture, since most paludicul-
ture crops such as sago and jelutong are also sensitive to 
flooding and fire.
Conclusions
Indonesian peatlands have been drained for agricul-
tural development for several decades. Although this 
has contributed to economic development through 
large-scale and, to a lesser degree, smallholder planta-
tions, peat drainage is increasingly causing environ-
mental externalities with adverse economic impacts. 
One of these is air pollution resulting from peatland 
fires. Peatland fires occur every year, even though their 
extent is much larger in dry (El Niño) years. Peatland 
fires, therefore, increase the long-term exposure of 
people to air pollution. We find that ­PM2.5 air pollution 
from peatland fires causes, on average, around 33,100 
adults and 2900 infants to die prematurely from air pol-
lution, in the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan alone. 
In addition, peatland fires cause around 4390 additional 
hospital admissions related to respiratory diseases, 635 
thousand cases of severe asthma attacks in children, 
and 8.9 million lost work-days each year in these two 
islands. Sumatra and Kalimantan have the country’s 
highest concentrations of smoke from peatland fires, 
but there will also be health impacts of peatland fires in 
other Indonesian islands and in neighboring countries, 
in particular Singapore and Malaysia [68]. The main 
source of uncertainty is in the CRF that we use, with 
different CRFs leading to annual premature adult mor-
tality ranging from 19,900 to 64,800 cases. Currently, 
the population of both islands is relatively young. With 
aging of the population over time, vulnerabilities to air 
pollution and health effects from peatland fires will 
increase. Hence, it is critical that health effects from 
peatland fires are acknowledged and considered in 
decision making, providing an additional element in 
support of current Government of Indonesia policies to 
reduce drainage-based agriculture in peatlands.

Analysis of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. ­PM2.5 concentrations are 
estimated using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). AOD is a measure 
of the extinction (scattering and absorption) of light by aerosols in a 
column of air from the Earth’s surface up to space. The AOD is used to 
represent the abundance of total aerosol particles in an atmospheric 
column [17]. To analyze AOD, we use data from three satellite instruments: 
twin MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 
instruments and the MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer) 
instrument [69]. We retrieve AOD with two algorithms that process MODIS 
radiances on both the Terra and Aqua satellites: Dark Target (DT) and Deep 
Blue (DB). The DT retrieval algorithm [70], is designed to retrieve AOD over 
dark surfaces (e.g. vegetated land surfaces and dark soils). The DB retrieval 
algorithm [71], uses blue wavelength measurements where the surface 
reflectance over land is typically much lower than at longer wavelengths, 
allowing for the retrieval of aerosol properties over both bright and dark 
surfaces. This study uses the recently released collection 6.1 of the MODIS 
retrieved AOD products, which include spatial resolution of 10 km and 
several updates to the DT [72], and DB algorithms [71, 73]. The MISR 
instrument [74], retrieval algorithm uses the same-scene multi-angular 
views provided by the nine view- angles to solve for surface and 
top-of-atmosphere reflectance contributions, providing AOD retrievals 
over bright and dark land surfaces without absolute surface reflectance 
assumptions [75]. Specifically, we use AOD retrieved from the recently 
released MISRv23 algorithm [76], which provides AOD at a spatial 
resolution of 4.4 km. Data from MODIS and MSIR is resampled at 4.4 km 
resolution and combined based on their relative uncertainties with 
Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD ground measurements [17, 77, 
78]. AERONET is a global sun photometer network established by NASA 
and PHOTONS (PHOtométrie pour le Traitement Opérationnel de 
Normalisation Satellitaire) [79]. This study uses AOD at 550 nm from level 2 
of the version 3 AERONET data [80]. To convert the combined AOD to 
surface ­PM2.5 concentrations, we use the simulated ratio of total column 
AOD to surface ­PM2.5. The ratio of total column AOD to surface ­PM2.5 is a 
function of the factors that relate ­PM2.5 mass to satellite observations of 
AOD (e.g., aerosol size, aerosol composition, diurnal variation, relative 
humidity, and the vertical structure of aerosol extinction [81]. We simulate 
this relationship using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. A full 
description of the GEOS-Chem simulation used can be found in [17]. We 
use v11–01 of GEOS-Chem, and our simulation is driven by assimilated 
meteorological data from the MERRA-2 Reanalysis of the NASA Global 
Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) [82]. The simulation is 
conducted for the years 2013 to 2017 with 47 vertical layers at a spatial 
resolution of 0.5° × 0.625° (~ 50 km × 60 km) across all of Asia (including 
Indonesia). The top of lowest model layer is ~ 100 m. Anthropogenic 
emissions of aerosols and their precursors are provided by the MIX 
inventory [83]. Biomass burning emissions are provided for individual 
years by the GFED4 open fire emissions inventory. A1.3 Emission factors.

concentrations observed in the Asian studies with a mean of 30.5 μg/m3. 
The authors’ analysis indicated robust association between ­PM2.5 and 
premature mortality. At the mean concentration of 15.7 μg/m3, a 10 μg/m3 
increase in ­PM2.5 was associated with a 10.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 
of 9.7 to 11.1%) increase in adult premature mortality. This risk function 
was used for the base case estimates since it included the greatest 
number of studies in total, with a few from Asia. To examine the sensitivity 
of the results to the choice of this study, adult mortality estimates were 
generated from three other cohort studies (Section 4.3). The health risk 
was applied to the mortality rate in the population over 30 years old 
(Section 4.1.3) [30]. A second estimate of adult mortality by Burnett et al. 
(2018) [9] involved a meta-analysis of 41 cohort studies from around the 
world while allowing for flexibility in determining the shape of the CRF. 
The derived CRF was an improvement over previous risk functions used 
for the GBD estimates, since it added studies from countries with very 
high concentrations of ­PM2.5 such as China, and relied solely on air 
pollution studies (previous CRF for GBD incorporated other combustion 
sources of ­PM2.5 such as secondhand smoke and household air pollution). 
In addition, the CRF is restricted to mortality from non-communicable 
diseases (NCD) and lower respiratory illness (LRI), rather than all-causes, 
since these two outcomes have been closely linked to ­PM2.5 exposure in 
both mortality and morbidity studies. The resulting CRF is non-linear and 
fairly complex statistically. The Burnett et al. (2018) risk function, [9], was 
applied to the NCD + LRI mortality rate in the population older than 
25 years (Section 4.1.3). Figure A2.1 shows the shape of the Burnett et al. 
(2018) function, along with the other studies used for the CRF. A third 
analysis was based on Crouse et al. (2020) [37], who utilized census data 
on 2.4 million Canadian adults to examine non-accidental and cause-
specific mortality between 2001 and 2011. ­PM2.5 exposures were assigned 
to participants’ residence using satellite-based estimates. Of particular 
interest, the study compared impacts of using three different average 
exposure periods (1, 3, and 8 years), so it is relevant to the five-year 
average of concentrations due to peatland fires. For a 10 μg/m3 change in 
­PM2.5 the associated with risk estimates for non-accidental mortality of 
approximately 11% (95% CI = 8, 13%), 20% (95% CI = 17, 23%) and 23% 
(95% CI = 20, 27%), respectively, for one-, three- and eight-years of average 
prior exposure. Existing studies indicate the effects of exposure changes 
can be experienced within one or 2 years [84–86], but [37], found larger 
risks when even longer exposure times were considered. For the 
sensitivity analysis, the risk associated with 3 years of exposure was used 
to approximate the impact of the five-years of exposure from the peatland 
fires, and the risk associated with 1 year of exposure was used for 
calculating the impact of the single year (2015). The Crouse et al. (2020) 
health risk [37], was applied to the mortality rate in the population over 
30 years old. The fourth, and final, study used in the sensitivity analysis is 
based on the recommendations from WHO’s HRAPIE (2013) review [7], 
which was based primarily on an earlier meta-analysis [8]. The estimated 
risk for all-cause mortality (for the population 30+) was based on eleven 
studies available at the time. The resulting risk was 6% (95% CI = 4, 8%). As 
shown in Fig. 6, the CRF from Vodonos et al. (2018) [30] lies in between 
those of the three other studies. Fig. A1. Approximate change in mortality 
risk vs ­PM2.5 concentration for different published studies. The risk 
estimates from two recent cohort studies conducted in China are 
presented for comparison with the studies used for the base case and 
sensitivity analysis. Li et al. (2018) examined a cohort of over 13,000 
participants from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey [87]. 
­PM2.5 exposures were assigned to residential locations and derived from 
remote sensing satellite data at a 1 km grid resolution. The median 
concentration was 50.7 μg/m3. The estimated all-cause mortality risk for a 
10 μg/m3 change in ­PM2.5 was 8% (95% CI = 6, 9%). Another study [88] 
(which was included in the meta-analyses of Vodonos and Burnett cited 
above) analysed a cohort of 190,000 men randomly selected from 45 of 
China’s 145 Disease Surveillance Points around the country. ­PM2.5 
concentrations were developed by combining data from remote sensing 
satellites, chemical transport model and ground-based monitors. With a 
mean ­PM2.5 concentration of 43.7 μg/m3, the non-accidental mortality risk 
estimate for a 10 μg/m3 change in ­PM2.5 was 9% (95% CI = 8, 9%). A1.5.

Mortality and morbidity among people living
close to incinerators: a cohort study based on
dispersion modeling for exposure assessment
Andrea Ranzi1†, Valeria Fano2†, Laura Erspamer1, Paolo Lauriola1, Carlo A Perucci2 and Francesco Forastiere2*
Abstract
Background: Several studies have been conducted on the possible health effects for people living close to incinerators
and well-conducted reviews are available. Nevertheless, several uncertainties limit the overall interpretation of the
findings. We evaluated the health effects of emissions from two incinerators in a pilot cohort study.
Methods: The study area was defined as the 3.5 km radius around two incinerators located near Forlì (Italy).
People who were residents in 1/1/1990, or subsequently became residents up to 31/12/2003, were enrolled in a
longitudinal study (31,347 individuals). All the addresses were geocoded. Follow-up continued until 31/12/2003 by
linking the mortality register, cancer registry and hospital admissions databases. Atmospheric Dispersion Model
System (ADMS) software was used for exposure assessment; modelled concentration maps of heavy metals (annual
average) were considered the indicators of exposure to atmospheric pollution from the incinerators, while
concentration maps of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were considered for exposure to other pollution sources. Age and
area-based socioeconomic status adjusted rate ratios and 95% Confidence Intervals were estimated with Poisson
regression, using the lowest exposure category to heavy metals as reference.
Results: The mortality and morbidity experience of the whole cohort did not differ from the regional population.
In the internal analysis, no association between pollution exposure from the incinerators and all-cause and cause-
specific mortality outcomes was observed in men, with the exception of colon cancer. Exposure to the incinerators
was associated with cancer mortality among women, in particular for all cancer sites (RR for the highest exposure
level = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.99), stomach, colon, liver and breast cancer. No clear trend was detected for cancer
incidence. No association was found for hospitalizations related to major diseases. NO2 levels, as a proxy from
other pollution sources (traffic in particular), did not exert an important confounding role.
Conclusions: No increased risk of mortality and morbidity was found in the entire area. The internal analysis of the
cohort based on dispersion modeling found excesses of mortality for some cancer types in the highest exposure
categories, especially in women. The interpretation of the findings is limited given the pilot nature of the study.
Background
Several studies on the possible health effects related to
residing close to incinerators have been published and
well-conducted reviews are available [1-3]. Results from
ecological studies have suggested associations with some
reproductive outcomes (infant deaths and congenital
malformations [4]; birth defects [5]; congenital anoma-
lies and stillbirths [6]; gestational age [7]) and with
cancer (all cancer, larynx, lungs, esophagus, stomach,
intestine, liver, kidneys, bladder and breast) [8,9]. How-
ever, there are several weaknesses of these results due to
design issues such as lack of exposure information and
use of surrogate measures such as distance from the
source, lack of control for potential confounders. There-
fore several uncertainties limit the overall interpretation
of the findings. More detailed studies on incinerators in
France and in Italy suggest an increased risk for non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma [10-12], soft-tissue sarcoma
[13,14] and urinary tract birth defects [15].

the issue, and concerns of people living in areas near
incinerators require more in-depth studies [1-3]. Recent
investigations have used dispersion models to assess popu-
lation exposure [11,12], an approach that provides a better
exposure assessment than studies based on distance from
the source. However, such studies have used health data at
the aggregate level with numerator and denominator
information coming from different sources and with lim-
ited possibility of adjusting for confounding related to
socioeconomic status. The present work proposes an
approach in which exposure assessment is based on geo-
graphical characterization by means of dispersion models,
outcome information is collected within an individual-
based retrospective longitudinal study, and an area-based
socioeconomic status index is considered in the analysis.
The aim of the study was to evaluate the health effects
of emissions from two incineration plants in the nearby
resident population (Emilia-Romagna, Italy), while con-
sidering the effects of other environmental stressors and
socioeconomic status. Given the limited size of the
study and the consequent low statistical power, we con-
sidered this approach as a pilot study before addressing
the issue in the future using the same methodology to
evaluate the effects of other seven plants located in the
Emilia-Romagna region.
Methods
Characteristics of the plants
The municipality of Forlì (107,827 inhabitants in 2001) is
located in the Po valley (Emilia Romagna region, North-
ern Italy). Two incinerators are located about 3 km from
the town, about 200 m from each other (Figure 1):
• an incinerator of municipal solid waste (MSW)
that began operating in 1976 with two lines (capacity
of 35,000 Nm3/h, stack height 60 m.); a first renewal
was completed in 1993 (capacity of 58,000 Nm3/h),
and, finally, in 2000 a plant renovation brought the
total capacity to 60,000 Nm3/h (stack diameter 2.2 m,
exit velocity 6.5 m/s).
• an incinerator for hospital waste (HW) that began
activity in 1991 (stack height 39 m., capacity 7,500
Nm3/h), the authorized capacity was extended to 9,
500 Nm3/h in 1997 and to 12,500 Nm3/h in 1999. In
2003, a new plant was activated with a total capacity
of 21,500 Nm3/h and a stack of 49 m of height
(stack diameter 0.95 m, exit velocity 10 m/s).
The position and the structure of the two plants has
remained substantially the same over time (the only sub-
stantial change was the height of the HW chimney). His-
torical emissions data based on routine checks are only
available back to 1994 and indicate that between 1994 and
1996 high values of dioxins were emitted by the MSW
plant [16]. The emissions of main pollutants significantly
decreased in recent years, as shown in the Table 1 for the
MSW plant.
The study area
The study area was defined as the 3.5 km radius circle
around the two incinerators (the central point was the
middle distance between the two) (Figure 1), on the
basis of the previous literature [8,10] and the results of
the dispersion model (see below). Most of the area
included in the study is used for agriculture; the remain-
ing territory and the borders of the urban area are occu-
pied by three small industrial areas and by an urban
district of the city of Forlì. Besides the incineration
plants, the other main sources of air pollution are traffic
(from urban area and two major roadways), and domes-
tic heating during winter.
ADMS simulations
To define the exposure conditions in the area, we used
the results of an environmental study conducted during

Page 2 of 12the period 1997-2000 [17]. On the basis of emission
inventories of all the environmental factors currently
present in the study area (road traffic, industrial plants,
incinerators and heating), the quasi-Gaussian model
Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling System (ADMS)
Urban 2.2 [18] was used to simulate the impact of the
different emission sources. Estimated annual average
concentration maps of several pollutants (NO2, SOx,
COV, CO, TSP, C6H6, HCl and heavy metals) were pro-
duced. Heavy metals were the entire set included in the
current legislation for industrial emissions, i.e.: lead,
cadmium, mercury, antimony, arsenic, chromium,
cobalt, copper, manganese, nickel, vanadium, tin.
Based on these preliminary models, points of maxi-
mum and minimum fallout for pollutants emitted from
the incinerators were identified. Moreover, a point of
maximum fallout for all sources was identified. Several
monitoring campaigns were conducted to measure con-
centrations at the points of maximum and minimum
fallout using passive samplers, bulk passive sampler,
Wet&Dry and soil depositions for measurements and
determinations of SOx, NO2, CO, TSP, BTX, HCl,
PCDD/F, PAH, PCB and heavy metals. The best results
were found for heavy metals since the highest concen-
trations were found at the point of maximum fallout
from incinerators, the lowest concentrations at the point
of minimum fallout, while intermediate values were
found at the point of maximum fallout for all sources.
The same was not true for the other measured pollu-
tant, including dioxins and hydrochloric acid, with no
clear relation between the estimated points of minimum
and maximum fallout and the actual concentrations.
As a result, we decided to consider heavy metals as the
tracer of pollution from incinerators. We ran the ADMS
model using the characteristics of the plants, and author-
ized limits of emissions for heavy metals as for early
1990s. We are aware that the regulations changed during
the following ten years but we preferred to represent
exposure as it was in the past. The current situation was
also simulated using more recent authorized limit of
emissions (year 2005), in order to verify the exposure gra-
dients in the different scenarios.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was identified as the best tra-
cer of air pollution from all other sources. However, it
was not possible to reconstruct the emission scenario
for the other environmental pressure factors in the past,
so current emission factors were used based on the
available emission inventories and the authorized values
for emissions.
The ADMS requires hourly information about wind
speed/direction, total cloud amount, and air temperature
to calculate atmospheric boundary layer parameters.
Hourly surface meteorological data from the Meteorolo-
gical Service of the Regional Agency for Environmental
Prevention (ARPA Emilia Romagna) station network
were acquired to build the meteorological file for the
years of simulation.
Model outputs were mapped using ArcView GIS 8.2
[19] on an “intelligent” grid based on 100 × 100 fixed
nodes (rectangle of 7518 × 7618 m.) of the study area to
develop concentration grids for each tracer pollutant.
We constructed map layers by means of surface interpo-
lations (simple kriging) and obtained the concentration
maps for heavy metals and NO2.
Enrolment of the cohort and follow-up procedures
The General Registry Office of Forlì was the data source
for the enrolment of the cohort. Subjects who resided in
the study area on 1/1/1990, or who subsequently became
residents until 31/12/2003, were enrolled in a retrospec-
tive longitudinal study. For those subjects who entered in
the area after 1/1/1990, a minimum of five years of resi-
dence was required before starting the follow- up. The
follow-up was carried out through record linkage with
the regional mortality database (from 1990 to 2003)
which includes all deaths of the resident population from
anywhere in the country. The Cancer Registry database
(from 1990 to 2003) and the Hospital Admissions data-
base (from 1999 to 2003), provided by the Romagna
Cancer Registry and the Regional Health Information
System, were also used. Hospital admissions for specific
causes were considered relevant for the study to evaluate
cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity; the first admis-
sion for each subject and each cause was included in the
analysis. Subjects were considered at risk for the various
outcomes (mortality, cancer incidence, or hospitalization)
until they died, moved outside the region, or until the
last day of the follow-up (31/12/2003). The General Reg-
istry Office traced the geographical coordinates of all
residences after 1990 but residential histories before 1990
were not available. The relevant residence of each subject
was his or her home in 1990 or the first residence for
later arrivals.
Exposure indicators
We used the geo-coded addresses to define residential
exposures. Each subject in the cohort was assigned a
value of heavy metals and NO2 corresponding to the
estimated map values at the residence from the ADMS
dispersion model. Quartiles of the distribution of the
total population were calculated for heavy metals and
NO2. The final categorization, however, was finely
adjusted to consider the natural cut-off points.
Based on census data from 2001 for the area of Forlì,
an area-based indicator (census block) of socio-economic
status (SES) was defined. A total of 1,116 census areas
with at least 20 people for the town of Forlì were consid-
ered. Four census variables were chosen to represent
Ranzi et al. Environmental Health 2011, 10:22
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/22
Page 3 of 12different levels of social advantage: education, employ-
ment, housing conditions, and family composition. A fac-
torial analysis was conducted, to define a composite
indicator of socioeconomic position, combining algebraic
indicators and using the weight factor scores. The final
categories of the SES indicator (from low to high social
class) were based on the population distribution (quin-
tiles) of the composite index.
Data analyses
For all health outcomes considered, a preliminary analy-
sis was carried out in order to compare mortality and
morbidity of the entire cohort with an external reference
area. SMR (Standardized Mortality Ratio) and SIR (Stan-
dardize Incidence Ratio) were calculated to compare
mortality and cancer incidence of the cohort with the
regional population or with the local health district
population for hospital admissions.
In the integrated database of the cohort, for each indi-
vidual we had demographic information, SES level, expo-
sure levels at the residence for heavy metals and NO2,
date of entry, date of exit and several outcomes (mortal-
ity, incidence, and hospitalization). Person-years at risk
were calculated by calendar period, gender and age. Age
and socioeconomic status adjusted rate ratios (RR) and
95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of the association
with heavy metal exposure were estimated with Poisson
regression separately for males and females and for all
the health outcomes considered, using the lowest expo-
sure category as the reference. The choice of the relevant
outcomes was based on the literature review. Analyses
for soft tissue sarcoma were performed also by combin-
ing the results for men and women. To evaluate the pos-
sibility of confounding from traffic-related air pollution,
we ran an additional analysis using NO2 levels as an
adjustment factor. We considered a priori that the asso-
ciations to be noted were those with an increasing trend
in the adjusted rate ratios across the exposure categories
and/or a statistically significant rate ratio in the third or
fourth quartiles when compared with the first one.
The statistical package STATA was used for all ana-
lyses [20].
Results
The estimated annual average heavy metals concentra-
tion throughout the study area was 1.08 ng/m3 (stan-
dard deviation, SD = 1.03) in 1990 and 0.46 ng/m3
(SD = 0.45) in 2005. The annual average NO2 value in
2005 was 37.46 μg/m3 (SD = 6.56). The concentration
maps for heavy metals estimated for 1990 and for 2005
are illustrated in Figure 2a and Figure 2b, respectively.
The relative population distributions are rather similar
in the two exposure scenarios, although the absolute
values are different. Figure 2c illustrates the NO2
concentration map in 2005 indicating no spatial correla-
tion with predicted heavy metals concentrations.
A total of 31,347 individuals were enrolled in the
cohort (51.7% females). Their main characteristics in
relation to the four categories of residential exposure to
heavy metals are described in Table 2. The gender and
age distribution was rather similar over the four expo-
sure categories (although people in the second category
tended to be younger than in other categories) whereas
socioeconomic status and NO2 exposure were different.
People in the highest heavy metal exposure categories
tended to have a lower socioeconomic status than those
in the lowest categories (low social class: 8.6% in the
lowest heavy metal category versus 20.6% in the highest)
while NO2 levels were highest in the low heavy metal
group. As indicated at the bottom of the table, most of
the cohort members (93.1%) remained in the initial
heavy metals category throughout the follow-up. A total
of 3,407 deaths (1,753 males, 1,654 females) were
observed during the study period with a total of 354,702
years of observation.
The analyses of the overall cohort mortality compared
with regional rates indicated an all causes standardized
mortality ratio, SMR, lower than expected both in men
(SMR = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.87-0.96) and women (SMR =
0.92, 95%CI = 0.87-0.96); cancer mortality and hospital
admissions did not differ from the reference population,
although some excesses in mortality were found for
pleural cancer in men (SMR = 3.64, 95%CI = 1.66-6.91)
and bladder cancer in women (SMR = 1.76, 95%CI =
1.01-2.86). Results for cancer incidence confirmed the
pleural cancer excess in men (standardized incidence
ratio, SIR = 2.14, 95%CI = 1.03-3.94), while an excess of
breast cancer in women (SIR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.03-1.27)
was found.
Table 3 reports the results of the internal analyses of
the association between heavy metal exposure and
cause-specific mortality. No clear trend of all-cause or
cause-specific mortality in relation to estimated heavy
metals concentrations was observed in males. It should
be noted, however, that an increase in mortality from all
causes and from respiratory diseases was found in the
second exposure category when compared with the
reference. Also among women, no clear trend in all-
cause and cause-specific mortality was observed. How-
ever, higher mortality was observed in all three exposure
categories for all causes and for cardiovascular diseases
when compared with the reference category.
The results for hospital admissions for cardiovascular
and respiratory causes (Table 4) in both sexes confirm
the non-positive results observed for mortality. An
increase in chronic heart failure only in men was found
in the second category of exposure without a note-
worthy trend.

Page 5 of 12Table 5 reports the results for cancer mortality and
cancer incidence for men and women. For men, no clear
relation with increasing exposure to heavy metal was sug-
gested for site-specific cancer mortality and incidence,
with the only exception of colon-rectal cancer mortality
that was doubled in the third and fourth exposure cate-
gories. On the contrary, a clear trend of increasing overall
cancer mortality was seen among women. The all-cancer
mortality results appeared mainly due to a gradient of
increasing risk for stomach, colon, liver, breast, bladder
and lympho-haemopoietic cancer (mainly non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma and myeloma). Notably, the rate ratio for
breast cancer in the highest exposure category was 2.00
(95%CI = 1.0-3.99). Cancer incidence data did not con-
firm the results found for mortality as no clear trend was
detected.
No cases were observed in the reference category for
soft tissue sarcoma, therefore rate ratios could not be
calculated. On the other hand, four incident cases were
found in the third category of heavy metals among
women (RR = 4.71, not statistically significant, n.s.).
When results for men and women were combined, six
deceased cases were found and an excess in the highest
category of exposure (RR = 16.54; 95%CI = 1.72-159.07)
was detected.
When all analyses were repeated considering exposure
to NO2 as a potential confounder, none of the rate
ratios estimates changed substantially and the overall
findings were confirmed (data not shown).
We performed an additional analysis of mortality con-
sidering only residents who were present in the study
area in 1990. This sub-cohort represents the 78.8% of
the total cohort (91.3% of the total person-years). The
results were substantially similar with wider confidence
intervals although statistical significance was reached for
liver cancer among women at the 4th level of exposure
(RR = 7.39; 95%CI = 1.11-49.10, based on 10 cases).
Discussion
We evaluated mortality, cancer incidence and hospitali-
zation for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases among
people living close to incinerators using dispersion mod-
elling to assess exposure. The internal analyses showed
no association with non-cancer related mortality and

Page 6 of 12morbidity. However, predicted heavy metals concentra-
tions, as indicator of air pollution from the incinerators,
were somehow related to cancer mortality in women, in
particular for stomach, colon, liver and breast cancer. In
addition, a combined analysis of men and women sug-
gested an increase in soft-tissue sarcoma mortality
related to exposure to incinerators. The results were
adjusted for socioeconomic status whereas there was no
important confounding effect from pollution due to
other sources.
The excesses detected in the areas with higher expo-
sure levels were observed mainly among females. Of
course, a chance finding could be an explanation given
multiple testing but it should also considered that
women are a more stable population than men and mis-
classification of exposure is less likely to have occurred.
On the other hand, most of the associations that were
found for mortality cancer outcomes were not con-
firmed by incidence data although the time window of
follow-up was the same (1990-2003). A possible expla-
nation of these findings is that the effect of the exposure
on cancer incidence precedes the time window of our
study so that only mortality is affected.
From the results of the present study it is difficult to
determine the causality of the associations and which
specific agent emitted from the plants could have an
etiological role in the excess risk that we have found. Of
course, we considered heavy metals as a surrogate mar-
ker for exposure to a complex mixture of pollutants. As
for the results of other studies on incinerators, the role
of exposure to dioxins could be of importance in this
context. Dioxin refers to 210 congeners/isomers of
structurally and chemically related polychlorinated
dibenzo-para-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated
dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and the 2,3,7,8-tetra-CDD
(TCDD) is considered the most toxic dioxin congener in
this group. Dioxins are persistent in the environment
and resistant to biodegradation and are considered
human carcinogens [21]. The MSW incinerator in Forlì
did emit dioxins and the values were considered rela-
tively high until 1996 [16]. Like in our female popula-
tion, increases for all cancers and in particular for

Page 8 of 12cancer of the digestive system (stomach and colon rec-
tum) have been observed among occupational cohorts
exposed to dioxin [22] and in the Seveso population,
among residents in the more contaminated areas [23].
In addition, among women we observed an increase in
mortality for Hodgkin’s disease and myeloma (based on
few cases and not statistically significant) as it has been
reported among Seveso women [24] and in a French
study [11] where the increase of blood cancer was
related to dioxin exposure from incinerators. We
observed a clear excess for breast cancer but the litera-
ture on the risk of breast cancer in the proximity of
incinerators is rather poor [1,2]. No breast cancer
excesses were observed in Seveso’s longitudinal study,
following the 1976 accident [25]; however, the Seveso
Women’s Health Study reported a two-fold risk for
breast cancer among pre-menopausal women with high-
est serum levels of TCDD [26]. There are several other
studies that have found increased breast cancer inci-
dence [27-29] in females occupationally exposed to
dioxins. Finally, as in our observation, several studies
have related residency in proximity of incinerators with
liver cancer [8] and soft tissue sarcoma [10,2,14,30,31]
although negative results also exist [32].
The strength of this work is the longitudinal study
design adopted, in which individuals were followed for
various health outcomes, exposure was assessed with
advanced modelling techniques, socioeconomic status
and other environmental exposures were also considered
as potential confounders. To our knowledge, there are

Page 9 of 12no other studies on incinerators conducted at the indivi-
dual level with the details that we took into account.
Despite that, the methodological aspects of the study
and the main limitations should be considered.
Exposure assessment is a critical component of the
study. We define the study population as people living
up to 3.5 km far from the plants. This choice is based
on previous studies [8,10] and information by model
simulations on the profile of the distribution of pollu-
tant emitted by plants. In fact, this choice provided a
good contrast of exposure conditions and a better com-
parability of the contrasted population groups. We
geo-coded all the residential addresses and exposure was
assessed using the results of a model of dispersion of
pollutants into the atmosphere. A French study has vali-
dated Gaussian dispersion model for dioxins from an
incinerator with a campaign of measurements on the
ground in 75 sampling points [33]. The results con-
firmed the validity of the model in defining the different
gradients of exposure, and identified inconsistencies
between measured levels and those estimated by the
model only in the presence of complex topographical
situations (e.g. hills), a condition that does not apply to
the Po Valley. A recent British study compared the use
of distance as a proxy of exposure from a source of pol-
lution by means of estimates derived from dispersion
models and concluded that the use of the models signif-
icantly reduces the risk of misclassification embedded in
the use of the distance from a point source [34].
The approach we used for exposure assessment has
several assumptions and limitations. First of all, we con-
sidered only exposure to air pollution whereas other
exposure routes, such as soil contamination or food and
water consumption, could have importance. We consid-
ered only the individual residences at the beginning of
the follow-up and this choice was supported by the
observation that the exposure category never changed
during the study for over 90% of the subjects (Table 2).
Also, exposure was assessed at the beginning of follow-
up to account for diseases with a long period of induc-
tion-latency (such as cancer) where the relevant expo-
sure does not necessarily correspond to when it was
diagnosed but to exposure levels in the previous years
or decades. We used authorized emission values of pol-
lutants to simulate dispersion from incinerators. This
could have overestimated concentration values, but the
shape of the fallout and the gradients of exposure are
not sensitive to this choice. Finally, we assumed
that heavy metals are better tracer for incinerator pollu-
tion than other pollutants since there is vast literature
that indicates different heavy metals (such as Cd, Ni, As,
Pb, Zn, Cu, Mn) as possible tracers of incinerators
[16,35,36], and this choice was supported by monitoring
campaigns conducted during the study period.
The role of the potential confounders, in particular
other occupational and/or environmental exposures,
should be considered. We observed a cluster of inci-
dence and mortality for pleural cancer among men in
the second exposure category; the absolute number of
cases is low, but the relative risk is high. This cluster is
due to occupational exposure to asbestos in the small
industrial area in the second exposure category. There
are other environmental factors in the study area due to
the proximity of the highway and the urban area. We
took into account the effect of exposure to vehicular
traffic using predicted NO2 levels; the dispersion model
for NO2 showed no overlap between the areas of high
NO2 and the areas of high heavy metal levels. The traf-
fic-related pollutants in this case would act, at least in
theory, as negative confounders. However, when NO2
levels where considered in the analysis no important
changes in the relative risk estimates were noted, even
for respiratory mortality.
An additional limit, like many other epidemiological
investigations, is the lack of individual data about poten-
tial confounding factors such as individual socioeco-
nomic conditions, occupational exposure, and personal
lifestyle factors such as smoking habits. Data on socioe-
conomic status, available at the aggregate level (census
tract), allowed us to indirectly take into account other
factors related to mortality and/or cancer incidence (i.e.
smoking habits and occupational exposure are strongly
linked to socioeconomic conditions). In fact, rate ratios
estimates were attenuated after adjusting for socioeco-
nomic status (all causes, cardiovascular diseases and
some cancer types; data before adjustment are not
reported). On the basis of these findings, we cannot
exclude the possibility of a residual confounding by
socioeconomic status.
It is notable that the lack of information about resi-
dential history before 1990 has limited the possibility of
evaluating the effects of duration of exposure and
latency since first exposure, two common useful mea-
sures in cohort analysis. Finally, as already indicated,
power limitations given the size of the population stu-
died may have limited the possibility to provide stable
results. In fact, the study was able to detect a relative
risk of 1.3 in the last category of exposure for all cancer
combined (with a = 0.95 and b = 0.80).
Conclusions
We found some excesses of cancer mortality among
residents in areas with the highest predicted concentra-
tion of heavy metals. These findings might be possibly
related to pollutants released from the incinerators over
the past decades. This study contributes to the contro-
versy over the possible health effects of waste manage-
ment. However, future research into the health risks of

individual exposure, an improved knowledge of chemical
and toxicological data of specific compounds, multi-site

this view, an ongoing multi-site project over the entire

effects due to exposure to all eight incinerators operat-
ing in the region.

ABSTRACT 
 
Open waste burning (OWB) is a common disposal practice in several countries. However, this 
activity can serve as a source of particulate matter and black carbon, which possess a greater 
greenhouse effect potential than CO2. Moreover, particulates can produce chronic health impacts 
on residents around the burning areas. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the 
environmental effects and health risks associated with the open burning of household waste in 
Semarang, Indonesia. Four steps were followed to answer the research questions: (1) data 
collection through a random questionnaire survey, transect walk, and field survey; (2) estimation 
of environmental risk using the IPCC calculation method; (3) multiplication of emission factors to 
determine black carbon emissions; and (4) estimation of health risks based on chemical speciation 
bound to particulate matter. Open burning remained the second most common waste disposal 
practice even after the implementation of waste collection services by the government. Specifically, 
approximately 240.28 tons of waste is not collected by the environmental agency service every 
day, and 88.6% of the uncollected waste in the city is openly burned. Plastic burning contributed to 
the highest emission share among waste components, and annual total emissions due to OWB were 
estimated at approximately 53,809.66 tons. Although the carcinogenic risk was low, non-cancer 
disease risk exceeded the standard. Therefore, direct exposure of residents to OWB may pose 
significant health risks. The present work fills the scientific and knowledge gaps in the OWB studies.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Open waste burning (OWB) is a potential source of emissions in major cities of many low- and 
middle-income countries (Das et al., 2018; Lal et al., 2016; Nagpure et al., 2015). OWB releases 
many hazardous compounds that may pose risks to the public and environment around the 
burning areas (Powrie et al., 2021). OWB is an adverse practice to several sustainable development 
goals (SDGs), such as goal numbers 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation),ORIGINAL RESEARCH

11 (sustainable cities and communities), and 12 (responsible consumption and production) (Mihai 
et al., 2021). This practice is commonly undertaken in areas that are not covered by waste 
collection services, along with other disposal practices, such as burial or dumping on the open 
ground or water surface (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). Some open dumpsites with diverse waste 
characteristics may be burnt uncontrollably. For instance, a recent study reported that open 
burning at a Nigerian landfill site contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into 
the atmosphere (Daffi et al., 2020). Additionally, according to Sharma et al. (2022), the largest 
contributor of particulate matter (PM) emissions in India may be OWB by 2035 in the case of lack 
of appropriate political intervention. Therefore, these severe threats should be treated appropriately 
to reduce the possibility of other accidents. 
According to Ramadan et al. (2022a), the environmental and health risks of OWB exposure 
have attracted much research attention. OWB emits greenhouse and trace gases, PM, black 
carbon (BC), and other bound compounds (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). The IPCC 2006 methodologies 
have been extensively used to calculate the environmental impact of OWB practices. However, 
BC is not considered in these calculations and must be quantified using a separate procedure 
(Premakumara et al., 2018). BC produces a greater environmental impact than carbon dioxide or 
methane (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). Furthermore, OWB emissions are more dangerous because 
of their potential to emit hydrocarbons and metal-bound particulates (Chi et al., 2022). In particular, 
a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be released during the burning process 
because of the presence of plastic waste that is burned together with other domestic waste 
(Hoffer et al., 2020). PAHs can be released through volatilization and can bind PM (Hubai et al., 
2022; Velis and Cook, 2021). Importantly, some typical heavy metals with carcinogenic risk, such 
as Pb, Ni, and Cd, may be bound to fly ash (FA) generated from 0.01 to 14.16 mg kg–1 of burned 
waste (Park et al., 2013), posing carcinogenic and chronic health risks. 
Several studies have been reported the health effects of the OWB. Velis and Cook (2021) has 
been specifically reviewed about the health risks of open burning of plastic waste. In that study, 
dioxins, and related compounds (DRCs), bisphenol A (BPA), and PAHs were identified during the 
OWB incidents and informal recyclers are susceptible to high risk from direct inhalation and 
ingestion. Shih et al. (2015) estimated that OWB at landfill site increase PCDD/F concentrations 
in the environmental media. Several cancer deaths reported in Nairobi, can be related to the 
dioxin emissions from OWB. However, estimation of the cancer posed by dioxin is differs among 
the populations, uncertainty occurred in the estimation. Kodros et al. (2016) made estimation 
related to the global mortalities to the ambient PM2.5 emissions from OWB. The results interestingly 
showed that the 9% of mortalities from PM2.5 emissions is due to biomass burning. Since it is a 
coarse model estimation, smaller scale of study in regional, national, or city scale is needed to 
reduce the uncertainties of the estimated model. 
In the previous studies, Park et al. (2013) and Hoffer et al. (2020) estimated the potential of 
smoke, heavy metal, and PAH-bound PM emission factor from different type of OWB. In another 
study, Reyna-Bensusan et al. (2019) measured BC emissions from uncontrolled waste burning and 
estimated their effects on global warming potential (GWP). In addition, the emission pattern and 
contribution of OWB practices have been estimated at the national level (Cheng et al., 2020; Pansuk 
et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2022) and city level in some countries (Das et al., 2018; Lal et al., 2016; 
Nagpure et al., 2015; Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). Meanwhile, according to Chaudhary et al. 
(2022), waste burning may be legalized through the use of portable clean air devices as substitutes 
for conventional OWB systems. Recently, Ramadan et al. (2022b) conducted transect walk surveys 
in Semarang during semi-lockdown in rainy seasons. The authors studied CO, CO2, HC, NOx, and total 
particulate matter (TPM) emissions from OWB. The combination of transect walk and questionnaire 
survey is better for making a robust inventory of emissions especially for OWB incidents (Ramadan 
et al., 2022a). In another study, Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) have summarized typical emissions from 
OWB; however, the authors estimated emission factors using old data, due perhaps to the lack of 
availability of data on current OWB practices. Previously, the contribution of OWB to GWP has only 
been evaluated once by Reyna-Bensusan et al. (2019), and the health risks associated with FA or 
bottom ash (BA) from OWB remain largely unknown. Most previous studies focused on the emission 
profiles of biomass burning, and limited scientific evidence is available regarding the impact of 
OWB exposure on the environment and human health (Powrie et al., 2021).ORIGINAL RESEARCH

To this end, the present study is a continuation of previous work by Ramadan et al. (2022b). 
Specifically, the existing disposal practices were identified through a randomized survey among 
the citizens of Semarang. In addition, the transect walk method was used to detect the potential 
waste burning incidents, and environmental risk was determined by multiplying the total waste 
burning in Semarang by the potential BC and GHG emissions reported in literature. Finally, FA 
and BA residues from the open burning of household waste were characterized in terms of their 
chemical speciation and potential health risks. This study was focusing to the FA/BA residues and 
not discussing the exhaust gas because the information was already presented in the previous 
work. Our findings can fill the gaps in high-level data inventories of OWB and support appropriate 
policy and decision making aimed at reducing emissions from the waste sector.  
 
2 METHODS 
 
The study involved four sub-activities: an online questionnaire survey, a transect walk survey, 
environmental risk assessment, and health risk estimation. Detailed information on each sub-
activity is provided in the following sub-sections. 
 
2.1 Online Questionnaire Survey 
An online questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the current waste disposal 
practices and open burning potential in Semarang. The questionnaire comprised nine questions, 
including the name of the respondent (secured as privacy), sub-district where they live, number 
of family members, number of family members who burned their waste, burning frequency 
(daily), common waste disposal practices, availability of waste collection services, availability of 
door-to-door collection vehicles, and frequency of waste collection. According to Semarang City 
Statistical Agency, the total population of Semarang City is 1,656,564. Thus, using the formula 
shown by Hu et al. (2019), the sample size at a 95% confidence level and margin of error of 5% 
can be determined as much as 385, which later becomes the minimum data amount. Therefore, 
the questionnaires were distributed to 408 citizens. However, after data cleaning, answers from 
only 344 respondents were selected for analysis because of completeness and validity. Descriptive 
analysis was applied to the questionnaire data. The number of respondents (ra–d) from rural, 
outer peri-urban, inner peri-urban, and urban areas was 86, 85, 89, and 84, respectively. To 
determine the average number of family members (FMOB) who burned their waste and occurrence 
possibility of a burning waste event (BEa–d) in each cluster, Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) were used.

In Eq. (2), BF is burning frequency, which was defined daily, and 90 represents the maximum 
day of burning frequency. If the respondents reported no burning frequency in a specific area, BF 
was considered 90. 
 
2.2 Transect Walk Survey 
The transect walk survey followed the method described by Ramadan et al. (2022b). The 
surveys were conducted at the same location and following the same methods during the dry 
season from May to July 2021 in semi-lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The surveys 
were conducted in 16 of the 144 sub-districts of Semarang. Sub-districts with similar geography, 
demographics, and waste collection services were selected based on clustering results. In each 
sub-district, a transect line of approximately 10 km was set in a loop or straight line. Each clusterORIGINAL RESEARCH

comprised four sub-districts representing urban, inner peri-urban, outer peri-urban, and rural 
areas. Before the field survey, the surveyor was trained to ensure the same perception of waste 
pile measurement along the transect line. The surveyor documented the waste pile; flattened it; 
and then recorded the coordinates, dimensions, and burning conditions. Unburnt waste piles along 
each transect line were characterized and brought to the laboratory for burning tests. Detailed 
information on the burning test can be seen in Ramadan et al. (2022b). The amount of waste 
burned at the city scale was extrapolated by multiplying the average waste pile density by the total 
sub-district area in each cluster. This coarse estimation was used to calculate the environmental 
risk of OWB. 
 
2.3 Environmental Risk Assessment 
After estimating the total waste burned, the environmental risk caused by CO2, CH4, and N2O 
emissions was calculated using the equation derived from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 5 (Waste) (Beltran-Siñani and Gil, 2021). BC emissions were 
calculated separately because they are not included in the IPCC inventory. Therefore, BC emissions 
from OWB must be quantified separately, as this component is categorized as a short-lived climate 
pollutant (SCLP) and presents a higher GWP than CO2 or CH4 (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). 
Eqs. (3–6) were used to estimate CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC emissions from open burning incidents 
in Semarang.

Mwb represents the wet weight of waste burned in the city (t y–1), dm is the dry matter fraction 
of the burned waste, CF is the fraction of carbon in the dry matter, FCF is the fraction of fossil 
carbon in the total carbon, CE is the combustion efficiency, CoF is a conversion factor of 10–6 
kg mg–1, and j represents the type of waste being burned. Some parameters, such as dm, CF, and 
FCF, were derived from default data in the IPCC inventories. From recent studies, the emission 
factors (EFs) for CH4, N2O, and BC were set at respectively 4, 0.24, and 4.7 g of pollutant per 
kilogram of burned wet waste. All EFs are based on Tier 1 or global emission default where 
assumed the waste contains 25–50% of DOC and 2% of N in dry matter and 60% of moisture 
content (Beltran-Siñani and Gil, 2021; Sharma et al., 2019). All emissions were converted to 
ton year–1. Then, GWP was calculated by summarizing the number of equivalencies for each 
pollutant (CH4, N2O, and BC) to CO2 (Em). The values of 100-year GWP or CO2-eq (GWPk) for CH4, 
N2O, and BC were 34, 298 (Hawthorne et al., 2017), and 1,100 (Bond et al., 2011), respectively. 
Total GWP of OWB was calculated using Eq. (7). 
 
2.4 Health Risk Estimation 
The burning test followed the description by Ramadan et al. (2022b) and Park et al. (2013). 
The test was considered complete when fresh waste was completely burned. FA was collected 
using an isokinetic cyclone separator during the burning test. TPM and BA were further analyzed byORIGINAL RESEARCH

identifying metal- and PAH-bound particulates. TPM and BA (0.1 g) were analyzed at the Advanced 
Chemistry Research Center, National Research and Innovation Agency, Indonesia. Metal-bound 
particulates were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry 
(ICP-OES). PAHs were analyzed by preparing 10 g of FA and BA samples and extracting them using 
50 mL of dichloromethane while shaking for 6 h. The extract was concentrated to 2 mL using a rotary 
evaporator and then transferred to amber glass vials for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS) analysis. 
Potential health risks were evaluated by considering the cancer risk (CR) following human exposure 
to metals and PAHs, specifically among people who burn the waste. Since municipal waste 
burning is mostly conducted in the backyard, many people surrounding the house may have the 
same possibility of being exposed to FA. The average exposure doses of metal- and PAH-bound 
particulates from FA and BA were estimated using Eqs. (8–10), presented by Keshavarzi et al. 
(2015), Liang et al. (2019), and Khan et al. (2020).

D represents the exposure dose, which involves three main pathways, namely ingestion (Ding), 
dermal contact (Dderm), and inhalation (Dinh). C is the total concentration of soil PAHs and metals 
(mg kg–1). IRing and IRinh are the ingestion and inhalation rates, respectively (mg day–1). FE represents 
the frequency of exposure (days year–1). ED indicates the duration of exposure (year). BW is the 
average body weight (kg). AT is the lifespan (d). In equation for the dermal contact exposure 
dose, SA represents the surface area of the skin exposed to contaminants (cm2), AF is the dermal 
adherence factor (mg cm–2), and ABS is the factor of absorption. PEF is particle emission factor 
(m3 kg–1) in the inhalation exposure dose calculation (Dinh). 
CR of hydrocarbon-bound particulates was estimated using Eqs. (11–14) (Liang et al., 2019), 
and chronic risk exposure caused by heavy metals from each pathway was determined using 
Eq. (15). The hazard index (HI) was determined to estimate the overall chronic risk (Eq. (16)). The 
CR of only Cd, Pb, and Ni was considered since these metals are carcinogenic. Cd, Pb, and Ni 
contamination occurs through inhalation; therefore, CR caused by these metals was estimated 
by multiplying the inhalation exposure dose Dinh with CSFinh and accounted for 6.3, 9.8, and 0.042 
for Cd, Pb, and Ni, respectively. Pb can also be ingested, resulting in the values of 0.0085 mg kg–1 d–1 
of CSFing. The human threshold set by the U.S. EPA (2001) for CR is > 10–6. The higher the CR value, 
the greater the carcinogenic risk to humans (Khan et al., 2020).

3 RESULTS 
 
3.1 OWB Practices in Semarang 
Indonesia has two classifications of cities, namely city and regency; a typical regency has a less 
dense population and a larger area than a city. Semarang is the capital city of the Central Java 
Province, which explains the availability of an efficient waste collection system covering almost 
all sub-districts. This may reduce the possibility of improper waste disposal practices. However, 
from our randomized questionnaire survey, OWB was found to be the second most common waste 
disposal practice. As shown in Fig. 1(a), other improper practices, such as burying and direct disposal 
in the river, also exist. The proportion of composting, recycling, and reuse was small (2% in total), 
indicating the presence of a linear or conventional system (collection, transport, and disposal) in 
the city. The door-to-door waste collection in Semarang is managed by each neighborhood unit (NU) 
or association (NA), which gathers waste from households and brings it to the waste collection site 
(WCS). The municipal government manages the transportation of waste from the waste collection 
sites to landfills. From areas near the landfill, the door-to-door waste collection vehicle directly 
brings the collected waste to the landfill. Each NU/NA has a different waste collection system, as 
shown in Fig. 1(b); three-wheeled motorcycles are the major household waste collection vehicles 
in Semarang. Waste from some areas is not collected by vehicles and burning or direct disposal 
of waste into the environment are the common practices in such areas. Respondents from theORIGINAL RESEARCH

rural and outer peri-urban areas are most likely to burn their waste rather than bringing it to the 
nearest WCS. 
Fig. 2 presents some interesting findings regarding waste burning practices in Semarang. The 
proportion of people in families who burned waste was higher in rural areas than in other areas. 
This may be attributed to the lower waste collection frequency and availability of larger 
backyards in rural areas. Therefore, the higher the frequency of waste collection, the lower the 
possibility of waste burning or other improper waste disposal practices. A higher proportion of 
family members burning their waste implies that the practice has already become a habit for 
residents in rural areas. However, the present survey was based on an online questionnaire that 
was open to random citizens in the city, and the possibility of bias may therefore be high. Next, 
the transect walk survey was undertaken to precisely identify and model waste burning events 
in Semarang. 
 
3.2 Number of OWB Incidents 
Burned waste in Semarang exhibited specific characteristics. As such, organic matter and wood 
or branches dominated the waste composition of burned waste in Semarang (62.7%). As shown 
in Fig. 3, plastic waste (15.7%) is burned along with organic waste, which may contribute to higher 
BC emissions. Inert materials, such as glass and metals, were detected in outer peri-urban area, 
which accounting for 22.8% or the highest percentage compared to other region, indicating a 
lower burning efficiency in this region. People in rural areas are more likely to burn organic matter, 
wood, or branches than those in other areas as much as 82.4%. The highest burning of backyard 
waste was noted in rural areas. This may be attributed to the availability of larger backyards in 
rural areas than in other areas. However, the proportion of plastic in burned waste tended to be 
higher in outer and inner peri-urban areas which is 16.3% and 25.0%. Then, the greatest contributor 
to plastic waste burning was the inner peri-urban area. Interestingly, outer peri-urban areaORIGINAL RESEARCH

showed a greater diversity of waste being burned since almost all the waste composition except 
glass and miscellaneous exceed 10% of total composition. The average pile density of waste 
found in Semarang was 232.62 ± 26.98 kg m–3. Nonetheless, among burned waste, organic waste 
(leaves > yard waste > food waste) and LWTR (wood > textiles > leather > rubber) accounted for 
the highest share, followed by plastic, paper, and other waste/miscellaneous. Polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET, 5.4%) contributed to the highest burned plastic fraction in Semarang, 
followed by low-density polyethylene (LDPE, 4.9%), polyvinyl chloride (PVC, 3.5%), high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE, 1.4%), polypropylene (PP, 0.2%), polystyrene (PS, 0.1%), and other plastic 
waste that does not belong to or is a combination of the other six categories of plastic waste, 
such as bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC), or bioplastics (0.2%). 
As shown in Table 2, waste burning per capita was the highest in rural areas, followed by the 
outer peri-urban, inner peri-urban, and urban core areas. Since the scaling-up method is based 
on total areas in the cluster, outer peri-urban areas were the highest potential contributor to 
OWB. Overall, rural and outer peri-urban areas are the potential hotspots of OWB. Even urban 
core areas were not free of burning incidents, indicating that burning practices are preferred for 
waste management even in urban cores regardless of the availability of a waste collection system. 
However, as in the case of urban cores, in the other places, the frequency of non-burning incidents 
was lower than that of burning incidents. 
 
3.3 Environmental Impact of OWB 
Coarse estimation results demonstrated that CO2 (25,260.32 t y–1) is the largest pollutant 
emitted from OWB, followed by BC (365.30 t y–1), CH4 (310.89 t y–1), and N2O (18.65 t y–1). Because 
the GWP of BC over a 100-year horizon is higher than that of other pollutants, OWB practices emit 
a higher CO2 equivalency than methane (Table 3). Specifically, at least 53,809.66 tons of CO2-eq are 
emitted annually in Semarang from OWB practices. Based on data from 2018, Syafrudin et al. 
(2021) estimated that the overall emissions from the waste sector were approximately 1,650 kt; 
however, the authors ignored the potential of waste burning events and attributed the highest 
emissions to uncontrolled landfills. Moreover, previous studies used different approaches (tiers 1 
and 2) to create data inventories. 
 
3.4 Health Risks of OWB 
As shown in Table 4, nine hydrocarbon compounds and eight metal elements were detected 
in FA and BA collected from OWB. Among individual PAHs, some compounds, such as Nap, Bip,

Ant, Flua, Nnt, and Tp, were detected in both FA and BA samples. Meanwhile, Ace and Fle were 
detected in FA alone, whereas Pyr was detected in BA alone. Among PAHs bound to particulates, 
the highest concentrator (FA and BA) was Tp with the average concentration of 0.896 mg kg–1 
and 0.403 mg kg–1 for the FA and BA, respectively. The order of concentration from the highest 
to lowest in FA after Tp was Pyr (0.236 mg kg–1) > Flua (0.180 mg kg–1) > Ant (0.139 mg kg–1) > 
Nnt (0.067 mg kg–1) > Nap (0.052 mg kg–1) > Bip (0.046 mg kg–1). While for BA, the order after Tp 
was Nnt (0.316 mg kg–1) > Bip (0.232 mg kg–1) > Ant (0.241 mg kg–1) > Fle (0.187 mg kg–1) > Flua 
(0.130 mg kg–1) > Ace (0.103 mg kg–1) > Nap (0.067 mg kg–1). Heavy metal concentrations in FA 
and BA were comparable. Specifically, concentrations of Zn of FA and Mn of BA were 2,072.35 
and 1,699.26 mg kg–1, which were significantly higher than those of the other metals. Since the 
present study is the first to evaluate the open burning of municipal waste, specifically in Indonesia, 
no historical or background concentrations are available for comparison. In the present study, as 
it can be seen in Table 4, the order of metal concentrations from the highest to lowest was Zn 
(2,072.35 mg kg–1) > Mn (1,383.40 mg kg–1) > Cu (124.81 mg kg–1) > Cr (87.63 mg kg–1) > Pb (43.58 
mg kg–1) > As (17.25 mg kg–1) > Cd (16.18 mg kg–1) > Ni (14.19 mg kg–1) in FA and Mn (1,699.26 
mg kg–1) > Zn (975.31 mg kg–1) > Cu (124.81 mg kg–1) > Cr (41.44 mg kg–1) > Pb (39.53 mg kg–1) > 
As (22.10 mg kg–1) > Cd (5.96 mg kg–1) > Ni (5.32 mg kg–1) in BA. Of the nine metal elements 
selected, only Hg was not detected during measurement. 
Furthermore, CR was measured to evaluate the potential carcinogenic effects of exposure to 
environmental pollutants. Three potential exposure pathways exist: ingestion, dermal contact, and 
inhalation. Details of calculation for each compound and element are provided in supplementary 
material, and the carcinogenic risk of exposure is presented in Table 5. Children are at a higher 
risk of exposure to metals and PAH-bound particulates, which produce adverse effects. Ingestion 
is the greatest risk pathway for both PAHs and metals emitted from OWB activities, followed by 
dermal contact and inhalation. The total carcinogenic risk from inhalation is identical for children 
and adults, although adults are at a greater risk of dermal contact. The maximum observed CR 
was approximately 4.77 × 10–6, which is still within the tolerance threshold for humans.

Although the CR value was within the tolerance threshold for humans, HI indicated a greater 
potential for chronic health problems due to open burning activities. According to Keshavarzi et 
al. (2015), an HI of > 1 implies adverse health effects due to burning activities. Accordingly, FA 
may produce adverse health effects on children and adults. An aggregate HI was found in Table 6 
to be more than 1 for FA in children (1.05) and adults (1.26) which indicates the possibility of 
non-carcinogenic risks in the burning activities. Therefore, adults may experience more significant 
health effects than children due to FA. Dermal contact was the most significant pathway of adverse 
health effects with the maximum value of HQ is 1.15, followed by ingestion (0.83), and inhalation 
(0.00081). Specifically, the HQ through inhalation is the lowest than ingestion and dermal contact. 
The HQ for child through ingestion, both in BA (0.75) and FA (0.85) were found to be higher than 
adult (0.11 and 0.10 for FA and BA). The different result found in dermal contact where the higher 
HQ value found in adult (1.15 and 0.61 for FA and BA).  
 
4 DISCUSSION 
 
OWB practices are dominant in rural and outer peri-urban areas of Semarang because of the 
lack of waste collection services. Reyna-Bensusan et al. (2018) stated that regular waste collection 
and availability of waste collection facilities can reduce the intensity of OWB in urban and peri-urban 
areas. These speculations are consistent with the reports of Nagpure et al. (2015), who recorded 
the highest number of burning incidents in areas with a low socioeconomic status (SES) in India. 
Low-SES areas are similar to rural or peri-urban areas, which have a larger area but a lower population 
density. Typically, waste collection in such areas is extremely limited, and larger backyards are 
available at the household level. These contrasting socioeconomic profiles result in different 
burning profiles in selected study areas (Ramadan et al., 2022b). For instance, in rural areas of 
Mexico, over 65% of the total generated waste is burned, which is comparable to the amount of 
waste burned in rural areas of Semarang; meanwhile, < 10% of waste in urban areas is burned 
(Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). In addition, differences in lifestyle, income, and resources result 
in diverse waste disposal patterns (Mihai et al., 2021). In the present study, rural and outer peri-
urban areas were the largest contributors to open burning, where 10% of the total generated 
waste was burned, assuming that the total waste generation of 1,662 tons per day in Semarang 
according to the calculation of Ramadan et al. (2022b). Furthermore, intensive OWB may be driven 
by the lack of law enforcement and environmental knowledge among the residents. Residents 
are often unaware of the legal consequences of OWB (Mihai et al., 2021). In fact, OWB is a common 
waste disposal practice following waste collection by local authorities, such as in Indonesia (Ramadan 
et al., 2022b), South Africa (Haywood et al., 2019), Mexico (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018), India 
(Nagpure et al., 2015), Nepal (Das et al., 2018), Eswatini, and Ghana (Nxumalo et al., 2020). 
Residents tend to burn their uncollected waste rather than burying or disposing it off into water 
streams because (1) they do not have any other option to manage the generated waste and (2) it is 
easy to eliminate waste from their sight. Therefore, realizing that OWB is dangerous and damageORIGINAL RESEARCH

their property may be one of the motives to prevent OWB (Nxumalo et al., 2020; Ramadan et al., 
2022a).  
Data on the amount of burned waste and its composition are essential to provide scientific 
evidence and establish appropriate waste management systems and policies (Haywood et al., 
2019). Ramadan et al. (2022b) conducted a transect survey in the rainy season and noted that 
the composition of burned waste in outer peri-urban areas differed between the dry and rainy 
seasons. In the rainy season, the proportion of plastic waste was the lowest in burned waste. 
Overall, however, seasons did not significantly change the composition of waste being burned. 
In addition, waste composition is an appropriate tool for estimating GHG and particulate emissions 
and predicting the potential risks to citizens. For instance, burning of HDPE and other types of 
plastics may emit CO2, CO, NO2, SO2, and PM (Nxumalo et al., 2020). However, the composition 
of burned waste shapes the extent of risks and amount of contaminants released. Therefore, the 
inventories of emissions differ across cities or countries (Park et al., 2013; Reyna-Bensusan et al., 
2019). The urban areas of Semarang City present a lower waste burning percentage (9.7%) 
compared to other cities such as Vientiane City, Laos (15%), Steung Saen Municipality, Cambodia 
(21.2%), Padang City, Indonesia (11.5%), and Agra, India (24.2%) (Babel and Vilaysouk, 2016; 
Menikpura et al., 2022; Nagpure et al., 2015). In the present study, the amount of waste burned 
per capita in the urban areas of Semarang was the same (0.012 kg day–1) as that reported in the 
Kathmandu Valley. Meanwhile, the amount of waste generated per capita in the Kathmandu 
Valley (0.40 kg day–1) was half of that generated in Semarang (Das et al., 2018). Conversely, 
despite the similar amount of waste generated per capita (0.85 kg day–1), the amount of waste 
burned per capita was higher in urban area of Mexico (0.048 kg day–1) than in Semarang (See 
Table 7). However, the amount of waste burned per capita in rural areas of Mexico (0.280 kg day–1) 
was lower than that in the rural areas of Semarang (1.098 kg day–1) (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). 
This finding is interesting because rural areas represent a higher burning intensity, thereby acting 
as a hotspot of open fires in the city. 
Some gaseous pollutants and PM are emitted during burning. This issue is well known, because 
open burning also emits BC, which shows a higher GWP than methane and carbon dioxide. 
However, as BC is not included in calculations according to the IPCC methodological, its emissions 
are often underestimated and beyond prediction (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). BC has been 
categorized as an SLCP, different from other long-lived GHGs (Bond et al., 2011). Reyna-Bensusan 
et al. (2018) estimated annual BC emissions of approximately 24,840 tons over a 20-year horizon 
in Huejutla, Mexico, which is higher than that estimated in Semarang. In the present study, BC 
emissions from OWB contributed to over 5% of the relative total emissions in the city. Open 
burning can act as a source of many local respiratory illnesses and problems through inhalation 
of the generated smoke. However, this activity is underestimated because of the lack of data 
(Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). 
Based on the chemical speciation of particulate emissions, adults and children are at a potential 
chronic risk due to open burning incidents. Some metals can enter the body via dermal contact, 
ingestion, and inhalation pathways. Even though internationally accepted precautionary criteria 
have been set against metal- and hydrocarbon-bound particulates, residents may still experience 
pulmonary and respiratory illnesses in the case of lack of interventions against OWB. Since the 
value of HIs were all higher than the permissible limit, the more contact with both PAHs and trace 
elements can cause several disorders (Keshavarzi et al., 2015). In addition, people who are directly 
exposed to open burning may experience certain health problems, such as abdominal pain, 
headache, hypertension, glioma, and mental effects because of metals-bound particulate (Khan et 
al., 2020). However, those symptoms can be derived from other causes which need further in-depth 
study.  
Regarding problems and solutions, some lessons learned from previous studies may help 
decision makers reduce the environmental and health effects of OWB. First, a decentralized waste 
management system may be an appropriate short-term solution for an isolated and unserved 
waste collection system. As reported by Chaudhary et al. (2022), improved burning devices can 
reduce the emissions and health effects of waste burning, including landfill fires. Further, 
community-based solid waste management, as a decentralized system, can be used to reduce 
OWB activities (Budihardjo et al., 2022). Second, promoting circular economic opportunities amongORIGINAL RESEARCH

local leaders, such as upcycling and selling of valuable waste, can improve the economic benefits 
to citizens even in rural areas (Mihai et al., 2021). Third, increasing environmental knowledge 
through specific planned activities may encourage people to better manage their waste and stop 
burning waste. Inadequate waste management systems, which are supported by the lack of 
environmental consciousness, may increase the possibility of exposure to PAH- and metal-bound 
particulates emitted from open burning activities. Finally, a consolidated approach from waste 
management stakeholders is required to obtain an appropriate solution to reduce burning incidents 
(Permadi and Kim Oanh, 2013). Since the present study used some emission factors derived from 
literature, future studies should analyze precise emission factors for OWB to obtain a higher-tier 
inventory of health hazards and emissions. Moreover, different demographic characteristics 
should also be consideration when evaluating the cause behind OWB practices in the city level.  
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
 
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to comprehensively reveal the 
extent of waste burning in Semarang, the associated amount of emissions, and the potential 
health risks of OWB incidents. Rural and outer peri-urban areas are the highest contributors to 
OWB and should be noted as focus areas for reducing the climate impacts of OWB. Furthermore, 
BC emissions from open burning significantly contribute to GWP. Therefore, preventing OWB 
may contribute to the achievement of SDGs. From our findings, OWB is associated with a small 
CR, particularly due to emitted particulate matter. However, exposure to OWB may be associated 
with a high risk of certain chronic diseases. Thus, preventive measures are warranted against 
OWB at the household level.

Abstract. Open burning of household solid waste is a large source of air pollutants worldwide, especially in the
Global South. However, waste burning emissions are either missing or have large uncertainties in local, regional,
or global emission inventories due to limited emission factor (EF) and activity data. Detailed particulate matter
(PM) chemical speciation data are even less available. This paper reports source proﬁles and EFs for PM2.5
species as well as acidic and alkali gases measured from laboratory combustion of 10 waste categories that
represent open burning in South Africa. Carbonaceous materials contributed more than 70 % of PM2.5 mass.
Elemental carbon (EC) was most abundant from ﬂaming materials (e.g., plastic bags, textiles, and combined
materials), and its climate forcing exceeded the corresponding CO2 emissions by a factor of 2–5. Chlorine had
the highest EFs among elements measured by X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF) for all materials. Vegetation emissions
showed high abundances of potassium, consistent with its use as a marker for biomass burning. Fresh PM2.5
emitted from waste burning appeared to be acidic. Moist vegetation and food discards had the highest hydrogen
ﬂuoride (HF) and PM ﬂuoride EFs due to ﬂuorine accumulation in plants, while burning rubber had the highest
hydrogen chloride (HCl) and PM chloride EFs due to high chlorine content in the rubber. Plastic bottles, plastic
bags, rubber, and food discards had the highest EFs for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitro-PAHs
as well as their associated toxicities. Distinct differences between odd and even carbon preferences were found
for alkanes from biological and petroleum-based materials: dry vegetation, paper, textiles, and food discards
show preference for the odd-numbered alkanes, while the opposite is true for plastic bottles, plastic bags, and
rubber. As phthalates are used as plasticizers, their highest EFs were found for plastic bottles and bags, rubber,
and combined materials. Data from this study will be useful for health and climate impact assessments, speciated
emission inventories, source-oriented dispersion models, and receptor-based source apportionment.

Introduction
Uncontrolled open burning is a common practice to dispose
of household or municipal solid waste (MSW) in many ru-
ral communities, especially in the Global South (Cook and
Velis, 2021; Sharma et al., 2022; Okedere et al., 2019; Das et
al., 2018; Bulto, 2020; Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018; Cheng
et al., 2020). While MSW incineration oxidizes nearly all
fuel carbon to carbon dioxide (CO2), open burning only fully
oxidizes about 58 % of the materials (IPCC, 2006). Open
burning has lower combustion efﬁciencies due to inefﬁcient
mixing of fuels and oxygen and low burning temperatures,
resulting in emissions of a wide range of air pollutants (Velis
and Cook, 2021). MSW is often burned close to community
residences. The limited dispersion and dilution increase di-
rect inhalation exposures and exacerbate adverse health ef-
fects (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014; Lemieux et al., 2004; Krecl
et al., 2021). MSW open-burning emissions deteriorate air
quality on neighborhood, urban, and regional scales (Oleni-
acz et al., 2023). Low-income communities are often more

impacted by MSW burning emissions, leading to environ-
mental justice concerns (Nagpure et al., 2015; Martuzzi et al.,
2010). It is estimated that exposure to PM2.5 from open burn-
ing of solid waste causes at least 270 000 premature deaths
globally (Williams et al., 2019) and 10 000–20 000 premature
deaths in Africa (Gordon et al., 2023; Kodros et al., 2016)
each year. Open burning also contributes to climate change
as a result of large carbon dioxide (CO2) and light-absorbing
carbon (including black carbon, BC) emissions, two of the
largest climate forcers (IPCC, 2013; Reyna-Bensusan et al.,
2018; Bond et al., 2013).
Despite the large environmental impacts of uncontrolled
MSW open burning, its emissions are not included or are
poorly represented in local, regional, and global emission in-
ventories due to lack of emission factor (EF) and amount
of MSW burned (activity) data (Cook and Velis, 2021; Ra-
madan et al., 2022). Most existing inventories only include
criteria pollutants (U.S. EPA, 2023) or greenhouse gases
(IPCC, 2006) with limited chemical speciation. In addition to
criteria pollutants, solid waste burning emits other toxic com-
pounds. Construction timber combustion releases high con-
centrations of arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), and copper (Cu),
while plastic burning releases phthalates, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and dioxins (Velis and Cook, 2021;
Wasson et al., 2005). Lemieux (1997, 1998) reported gas and
speciated particle emissions from simulated open burning of
household waste in barrels. However, the study was limited
to testing US households with and without recycling prac-
tices. Barrel burning may not represent open pile burning
due to different fuel–air interactions. Lemieux et al. (2004)
further summarized organic air toxics from open burning of
many materials, including MSW, and these data are used
in the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) AP-
42 Compilation of Air Emissions Factors (U.S. EPA, 1992).
Stockwell (2016) measured emissions from laboratory burn-
ing of shredded tires, plastic bags, mixed waste, and a va-
riety of biomass species. Gaseous chemical EFs were pre-
sented, but PM chemistry was not reported. Jayarathne et
al. (2018) reported EFs for PM2.5 (particles with aerody-
namic diameter ≤2.5 µm) and several components (carbon,
ions, metals, and organics) for combustion sources in Nepal,
including mixed waste under dry and damp conditions, two
types of plastic mixtures, and crop residues. Emissions of cri-
teria pollutants and PM2.5 compositions (carbon, ions, and
metals) were reported for several types of MSW in China
(Cheng et al., 2020). Several studies characterized PM mass
and chemistry for plastics burning (Hoffer et al., 2020; Wu et
al., 2021). These studies highlighted a large variation in EFs
due to the heterogeneities in waste compositions and burning
conditions.
Detailed PM chemical composition data are important for
many applications. The association between PM mass ex-
posure and mortality is well established, and exposure to
PM2.5 is one of the most important risk factors for premature
death in the global burden of disease (Murray et al., 2020).
However, as PM is a complex mixture, the toxicity and car-
cinogenicity of different chemical species are still uncertain
(Lighty et al., 2000; Kelly and Fussell, 2012). Epidemiol-
ogy and toxicology studies of PM chemicals are needed to
develop a mechanistic understanding of their health effects.
PM compositions are also used to evaluate visibility and cli-
mate effects. PM light scattering and absorption properties
depend on the hygroscopicity and optical properties of its
chemical components (Watson, 2002). BC, or elemental car-
bon (EC), is the major light-absorbing component of PM and
may have a global warming potential 900 times that of CO2
(Bond et al., 2013). Speciated emission inventories have been
applied in source-oriented dispersion models to estimate am-
bient concentrations and deposition patterns and to target ef-
fective emission reduction strategies (Reff et al., 2009; Si-
mon et al., 2010). Deposition from MSW burning emissions
is a major cause of discoloring of the Taj Mahal in India
(Lal et al., 2016). PM chemical composition is necessary for
receptor-based source apportionment, which uses the chem-
ical abundance patterns in source proﬁles to quantify con-
tributions of different sources to ambient PM concentrations
(Watson et al., 2016). The source proﬁle collinearities caused
by similarities is a major cause of source apportionment un-
certainty. Extending chemical analyses beyond convention-
ally analyzed elements and ions to include particle-phase or-
ganics can potentially provide molecular markers to mini-
mize collinearities.
This study used comprehensive laboratory combustion ex-
periments to quantify emissions from 10 types of MSW from
South Africa. EFs for CO2 and criteria air pollutants have
been reported by Wang et al. (2023). This paper focuses on
speciated source proﬁles and EFs for elements, acidic and
alkali gases and ions, PAHs, nitro-PAHs, n-alkanes, and ph-
thalates.

Methodology
2.1
Waste materials and combustion experiments
MSW materials were collected from typical household re-
fuses by SASOL, a petrochemical and energy company, in
the Zamdela community in South Africa. This is part of
SASOL’s Waste Collection Interventions (WCI) program to
assist local communities in MSW collection and disposal
in landﬁlls to reduce illegal open burning and improve air
quality. The materials were sent to the Desert Research In-
stitute (DRI) in Reno, Nevada, USA, for emission testing.
Due to customs restriction and potential deterioration dur-
ing shipping, the compositions of food discards and vege-
tation collected by the WCI were characterized, and simi-
lar mixtures were collected in Nevada for testing. Food dis-
cards included bread, potato and banana peels, lettuce, cu-
cumbers, and tomatoes (Cronjé et al., 2018), and vegeta-
tion included basin wild rye, Sandberg bluegrass, crested
wheat grass, red willows, and creeping wild rye, represent-

ing African bunch grasses, African sumac, and crab grass.
The 10 types of waste categories tested include (1) paper, (2)
leather/rubber, (3) textiles, (4) hard plastic bottles and food
containers, (5) soft plastic bags, (6) dry vegetation (0 % mois-
ture content), (7) natural vegetation (20 % moisture content),
(8) damp vegetation (50 % moisture content), (9) food dis-
cards, and (10) combined materials. The combined materi-
als were mixtures of all categories based on their mass frac-
tions in MSW. Glass, metals, and ceramics were added to the
combination to mimic their inﬂuences on burning emissions.
Moisture content was measured right after collection in the
ﬁeld. The moisture content for paper, leather/rubber, textiles,
and plastics was determined by a laboratory in South Africa
by measuring the mass loss gravimetrically after heating a
small fraction of samples at 103 ◦C for 30 min. The mois-
ture content for food and vegetation was determined at DRI
by baking the samples at 90 ◦C for 24 h. Because material
moisture content will likely change during transport and stor-
age, to represent ﬁeld conditions, the waste materials (except
food discards) were oven-dried at 90 ◦C for 24 h, rehydrated
to their natural moisture levels with distilled deionized water
(DDW), and re-equilibrated for at least 24 h before testing.
The major elemental compositions (i.e., carbon, C; hydro-
gen, H; nitrogen, N; sulfur, S; and oxygen, O) of the waste
materials were measured by an elemental analyzer (Model
Flash EA1112, Thermo Scientiﬁc). The carbon content was
used for the fuel-based EF calculation. The same procedure
was used to quantify the elemental compositions of ashes af-
ter combustion.
The experimental method has been documented by Wang
et al. (2023), and only a brief description is provided here.
For each burn, 0.5 to 20 g of waste material was placed in a
ceramic crucible and maintained at 450 ◦C to simulate open
burning. Each burn typically took 30 min, varying from 16 to
65 min. Paper, textiles, soft plastic bags, vegetation (with dry
and natural moisture content), and combined waste had both
ﬂaming and smoldering phases, while leather/rubber, plastic
bottles, damp vegetation, and food discards only smoldered.
A suite of gas and particle analyzers monitored the concen-
trations in real time, including CO2, carbon monoxide (CO),
oxides of nitrogen (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), PM2.5, and
PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 µm). Inte-
grated PM samples were collected simultaneously onto four
parallel ﬁlters that accommodated different chemical analy-
ses (Fig. 1). A total of 29 ﬁlter sets were collected, includ-
ing three replicates for each of the eight fuels, two replicates
for vegetation with 20 % and 50 % moisture content, and one
ﬁeld blank.
2.2
Chemical analysis
As shown in Fig. 1, the PM10 ﬁlters (Channel 4) were
weighed for gravimetric mass concentrations, while the
three PM2.5 ﬁlters (Channels 1–3) were analyzed for ele-
ments, ions, carbon fractions, and organic compounds (Chow
and Watson, 2013). Backup ﬁlters impregnated with gas-
absorbing solutions were analyzed for acidic and alkali
gases.
Channel 1 is a Teﬂon-membrane ﬁlter backed by a potas-
sium hydroxide (KOH)-impregnated cellulose-ﬁber ﬁlter.
The Teﬂon-membrane ﬁlters were analyzed for PM2.5 mass
by gravimetry using microbalances (Model XP-6, Mettler
Toledo, Hightstown, NJ) with 1 µg sensitivity (Watson et al.,
2017). In addition, 51 elements (from Na to U) were mea-
sured using a PANalytical X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF) an-
alyzer (Model Epsilon 5, Almelo, the Netherlands) (Wat-
son et al., 1999). The backup KOH-impregnated cellulose-
ﬁber ﬁlters behind the Teﬂon-membrane front ﬁlter were an-
alyzed for acidic gases, including hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF),
hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitrous acid (HNO2), nitric acid
(HNO3), and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as their corresponding
ions (i.e., F−, Cl−, NO−
2 , NO−
3 , and SO2−
4 ) by ion chro-
matography (IC) (Sturges and Harrison, 1989; Eldering et al.,
1991), which are known to emit from waste burning (Chris-
tian et al., 2010).
Channel 2 contains a quartz-ﬁber ﬁlter backed by a citric-
acid-impregnated cellulose-ﬁber ﬁlter. Half of the quartz-
ﬁber ﬁlter was extracted in DDW and analyzed for 10 water-
soluble ions, including ammonium (NH+
4 ), sodium (Na+),
magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), ﬂu-
oride (F−), chloride (Cl−), nitrite (NO−
2 ), nitrate (NO−
3 ),
and sulfate (SO2−
4 ) by using Dionex ICS 6000 IC sys-
tems (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Sunnyvale, CA) (Chow and Wat-
son, 2017). The backup citric-acid-impregnated cellulose-
ﬁber ﬁlter behind the quartz-ﬁber front ﬁlter was analyzed
for ammonia (NH3) as NH+
4 by IC.
Organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) and eight
thermal fractions (i.e., OC1–OC4; pyrolyzed carbon, OP;
EC1–EC3) were quantiﬁed following the IMPROVE_A ther-
mal/optical protocol using the DRI Model 2015 multiwave-
length carbon analyzer (Magee Scientiﬁc, Berkeley, CA)
(Chow et al., 2007, 2015b; Chen et al., 2015). A 0.5 cm2
punch was taken from the Channel 2 quartz-ﬁber ﬁlter and
heated in a pure helium (He) carrier gas at 140 ◦C (OC1),
280 ◦C (OC2), 480 ◦C (OC3), and 580 ◦C (OC4) tempera-
ture steps. Next, the carrier gas composition was changed to
98 % He and 2 % O2, and the ﬁlter continued to be heated at
580 ◦C (EC1), 740 ◦C (EC2), and 840 ◦C (EC3). Seven lasers
with wavelengths ranging from 405 to 980 nm were used to
monitor light reﬂectance (R) and transmittance (T ), which
were used to calculate wavelength-dependent light absorp-
tion. OC and EC were determined at the 635 nm wavelength
after R returned to its initial value to correct for OC pyrol-
ysis. The multiwavelength measurement allowed separation
of light absorption by black carbon (BC) from brown carbon
(BrC), which has unique wavelength dependence based on
fuel and combustion conditions (Chow et al., 2015b, 2018,
2021).

Figure 1. Analyses for the three PM2.5 and one PM10 ﬁlter channels.
A parallel quartz-ﬁber ﬁlter in Channel 3 was analyzed for
non-polar organic compounds, including PAHs, nitro-PAHs,
alkanes, cycloalkanes, hopanes, steranes, phthalates, and
other organics using in-injection port-thermal desorption–
gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS) (Ho et
al., 2008; Ho and Yu, 2004; Ho et al., 2011). Aliquots (1.0–
1.5 cm2) of the quartz-ﬁber ﬁlters were cut into small pieces,
spiked with internal standards, and inserted into TD tubes for
analyses.
Chemical data were quality-checked as part of quality as-
surance (QA) to ensure internal consistency and to achieve
mass closure. As shown in Fig. S1, the sum of measured
chemical species and reconstructed mass accounted for 73 %
and 99 % of gravimetric mass on average, respectively. High
coefﬁcients of determination (R2) of 0.98 assure that ma-
jor PM2.5 constituents (i.e., gravimetric mass, carbon, ions,
and elements) are quantiﬁed with high quality (Chow et al.,
2015a). To obtain chemical source proﬁles, the chemical con-
centrations were normalized to PM2.5 mass concentrations.
Potential markers and hazardous air pollutant emissions from
each waste category were assessed. Fuel-based EFs were cal-
culated based on carbon mass balance techniques (Wang et
al., 2023).

Results and discussion

Major PM2.5 compositions
Figure 2 compares average PM2.5 mass fractions for the ﬁve
major composition categories (i.e., organic matter, OM; EC;
ions; mineral; and others). Carbonaceous aerosol (OM and
EC) contributed more than 70 % of PM2.5 mass with minor
contributions from ions. OM was the most abundant compo-
nent, accounting for > 50 % of PM2.5 mass. EC had the high-
est abundances in the ﬂaming materials, including plastic
bags (49.4 ± 29.2 %), combined fuels (47.9 ± 13.2 %), tex-
tiles (12.8 ± 4.3 %), and dry vegetation (9.1 ± 2.2 %). De-

tailed mass fractions for each material are shown in Fig. S2.
High OC and EC abundances were also found for PM2.5
from waste burning in other studies. For example, Jayarathne
et al. (2018) found average OC and EC abundances of
77 % (ranging from 59 % to 114 %) and 2.6 % (ranging
from 0 % to 12 %), respectively, for mixed waste in Nepal.
Wu et al. (2021) found that carbonaceous components were
80.5 %–91.4 % of PM2.5 for ﬂaming burning of various plas-

53 %, respectively, which are similar to the ﬂaming emis-
sions in this study.
The abundances of the seven carbon fractions (i.e., OC1–
OC4 and EC1–EC3) by source type are shown in Fig. S3.
The sum of lower-temperature OC1 and OC2 fractions ex-
ceeded 20 % for most fuels, except for plastic bags and com-

bined materials that had intense ﬂaming combustion. Pa-
per and vegetation had higher OC3 + OC4 fractions (15 %–
30 %), consistent with their higher charring fractions (py-
rolysis of OC to EC during oxygen-free heating). Plastic
bags and combined materials had the highest sums of EC1
and EC2 (53 %–70 %), with plastic bags having much higher
EC2 (63 %) than EC1 (8 %), indicating higher combustion
temperatures. High-temperature EC3 (840 ◦C) was not de-
tected. Carbon fractions varied by moisture content in vege-
tation samples, with the highest OC3, OC4, and EC1 in dry
vegetation due to dominant ﬂaming combustion. As mois-
ture content increased to 50 %, the abundances of OC1 in-
creased, and OC2 remained approximately the same, while
OC3, OC4, and EC1 abundances decreased. Similar carbon
fraction distributions were found for barrel and pile burning
of MSW by Cheng et al. (2020).
Figure 3 shows EFs for PM2.5 and its major components
OM and EC. Rubber, plastic bottles, 50 % moisture vege-
tation, and food discards generated higher EFs for PM2.5
and OM among 10 source types, consistent with their dom-
inant smoldering combustion. Combustion of plastic bot-
tles produced the highest EFs for PM2.5 (651 ± 38 g kg−1)
and OM (635 ± 49 g kg−1). As shown in Fig. S2d, over
97 % of the plastic bottle PM2.5 is OM. Rubber had the
second-highest EFs for PM2.5 (141 ± 23 g kg−1), with 98 %
PM2.5 mass being OM (Fig. S2b). Plastic bags had the
highest EFs for EC (17.1 ± 1.9 g kg−1), followed by tex-
tiles (5.52 ± 0.24 g kg−1) and combined waste materials
(3.44 ± 1.98 g kg−1). Assuming a 100-year global warming
potential (GWP) of 900 for EC (Bond et al., 2013), the cli-
mate forcing of EC from these materials is a factor of 2–5
higher than that of CO2 (Wang et al., 2023).
As 50 % moisture vegetation only smoldered, the PM2.5
EF (88 ± 7 g kg−1) was over an order of magnitude higher
than those of dry (3.2 ± 1.3 g kg−1) and 20 % moisture
(4.8 ± 2.0 g kg−1) samples. Even though the dry vegetation
had a higher EC abundance than the 50 % moisture vege-
tation (8.2 % vs. 2.6 % of PM2.5), the 50 % moisture vege-
tation still had a higher EF for EC due to the much higher
EF for PM2.5 (Fig. 3). Pokhrel et al. (2021) reported PM
(≤720 nm) EFs for seven types of African woody biomasses,
averaging 19.2 g kg−1 (ranging 13.2–25.1 g kg−1) for burns
with MCE < 0.85, which are lower than that for the 50 %
moisture sample in this study; on the other hand, PM EFs
were 5.0 g kg−1 (ranging 0.82–22.2 g kg−1) for burns with
MCE ≥0.85, similar to those for the dry and 20 % moisture
samples.
As thermal EC and optical BC are often used interchange-
ably (Pöschl, 2003), Table 1 compares EC from this study
with EC or BC reported in the literature. The EC EF for
paper (0.86 ± 0.57 g kg−1) is in the same range as those
(0.5–0.76 g kg−1) reported by Cheng et al. (2020) and Wu
et al. (2021), while the EF for textiles is about 4 times
those reported by Cheng et al. (2020). A wide range of
EFs are reported for plastic bottles and bags. The plas-

tic bag EF (17.1 ± 11.6 g kg−1) is in good agreement with
plastic foam (18.7 ± 3.9 g kg−1) by Wu et al. (2021) and
close to a plastic mixture (10.3 ± 1.0 g kg−1) burned by Ja-
yarathne et al. (2018). Different vegetation types, mois-
ture content, and burning conditions resulted in variable
EFs. However, EFs for this study fall in the range reported
by Akagi et al. (2011) except for 50 % moisture vegeta-
tion that is 75 % higher than the maximum value by Akagi
et al. (2011). Andreae (2019) summarized emissions from
biomass burning for savanna/grassland, tropical/temperate/-
boreal forest, and agricultural residue fuels and reported av-
erage BC EFs of 0.42–0.55 g kg−1. The EF for mixed materi-
als (3.44 ± 1.98 g kg−1) is similar to those reported for damp
mixed garbage (3.30 ± 3.88 g kg−1) in Nepal (Jayarathne et
al., 2018; Stockwell et al., 2016) but is 5 times the sug-
gested value (0.65 ± 0.27 g kg−1) for global emission inven-
tory (Akagi et al., 2011; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). The high
variability in the BC EFs (1.4 ± 5.1 g kg−1) for mixed waste
burning is also shown by Andreae (2019) and is due to dif-
ferent materials and burning conditions as well as the limited
number of studies.

terials. Rubber had the highest EFs for Cl and sulfur (S) as

well as HAP elements cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), and
lead (Pb), while the 50 % moist vegetation had the highest
EFs for chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and sele-
nium (Se). Table S2 compares these heavy metal EFs with
those reported in the literature. The EFs by Park et al. (2013)
are lower than those by other studies for most elements, ex-
cept for higher zinc (Zn) EFs. For paper burning, both this
study and Cheng et al. (2020) found similar EFs for cop-
per (Cu) and Pb. The plastic bottles had much higher EFs
for Cr and Pb than plastic bags and other studies; high Cu
EFs for plastics are also found from this study and Cheng
et al. (2020). The high Cu emissions from paper and plas-
tics likely originate from the Cu compounds used for cyan,
green, and reddish-blue printing pigment (Zi˛eba-Palus and
Trzci´nska, 2011). The EFs for Cr, Zn, and Pb from dry and
20 % moisture vegetation are similar to those by Cheng et
al. (2020), while the Cu EFs for 50 % moisture vegetation are
similar to that by Cheng et al. (2020). For the combined ma-
terials, Cr and Ni are below detection limits in this study, but
the EFs for other elements are in the same range as those re-
ported in the literature, with large variations (Lemieux, 1997;
Christian et al., 2010; Jayarathne et al., 2018; Cheng et al.,
2020).
The elemental abundances are shown in Fig. S4. Cl abun-
dance ranged from 0.04 ± 0.04 % of PM2.5 mass for plas-
tic bags to 5.1 ± 4.3 % for dry vegetation. The low Cl abun-
dance in the tested plastics was probably due to their lack of
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) components. Vegetation samples
had higher potassium (K) abundances, consistent with the
fact that K is often used as a biomass burning marker. Plas-
tic bottles and bags had lower abundances of most elements
than other materials, similar to the ﬁndings by Valavanidis
et al. (2008). Sb has been reported as a potential marker for
solid waste burning because of its use in textiles (ﬂame retar-
dant), batteries, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) projec-
tion (Jayarathne et al., 2018; Christian et al., 2010). Figure S4
shows that Sb had higher abundances in rubber, vegetation,
and mixed materials, but with lower abundances in paper,
plastics, and food discards, indicating that caution should
be taken when using Sb as a waste burning marker due to
its high dependence on waste compositions. The Sb abun-
dance in the combined materials (0.035 ± 0.021 %) is simi-
lar to the value of 0.025 ± 0.033 % reported by Jayarathne et
al. (2018). The combined materials had higher abundances
of Pb (0.075 ± 0.062 %) than other waste categories, prob-
ably related to the metals and glass added to the mix; this

Jayarathne et al. (2018).

Acidic and alkali gases and ions
Acidic and alkali ionic species are present in both gas and
particle phases, and their partition depends on temperature
and reactions. Acidic and alkali gases are toxic and corro-
sive; they can cause adverse effects on human health, ma-
terials, and ecosystems if not neutralized soon after emis-
sion. Figure S5 shows elevated ionic concentrations for NO−
3
and NH+
4 on backup ﬁlters (i.e., in the form of HNO3 and
NH3, respectively). The sum of gaseous ion abundances
ranged from 0.6 % (plastic bottles) to 73 % (dry vegetation)
of PM2.5, higher than the particulate ion abundances (less
than 10 % of PM2.5). Figure S6 shows abundant Cl−and
SO2−

for dry and 20 % vegetation. Consistent with high
abundances of elemental K, dry vegetation and 20 % mois-
ture vegetation show high K+ abundances. Vegetation with
50 % moisture content had low K+ abundances, probably

because the dominant smoldering phase left most K in the
ash. The sums of anion equivalents were higher than those
for cations for most materials, likely because the hydrogen
ion (H+) was not measured; it might be associated with hy-
drochloric, sulfuric, or nitric acids. Therefore, directly emit-
ted particles appear to be acidic, although these would prob-
ably be neutralized by available NH3 soon after emission.
The deposition of the acidic waste-burning particles proba-
bly contributed to discoloring of the Taj Mahal in India (Lal
et al., 2016).
Figures 5 and 6 show that EFs for HCl from rubber as well
as HNO3 from rubber, textiles, vegetation, and food discards
and NH3 from food discards were 1 to 2 orders of magni-
tude higher than the corresponding particulate ions. Food dis-
cards and 50 % moisture vegetation had the highest EFs for
HF and particulate F−, consistent with ﬂuorine accumula-
tion in plants (Jayarathne et al., 2014). The modiﬁed combus-
tion efﬁciencies (MCEs) for the dry (MCE = 0.88) and 20 %
moisture (MCE = 0.91) vegetation samples were higher than
the 50 % moisture vegetation sample (MCE = 0.79) (Wang
et al., 2023). One would expect that the dry and 20 % mois-
ture vegetation samples would cause higher EFs for HF
than particulate F−due to preferred partition in the gas
phase at higher combustion temperatures and MCEs. How-
ever, low HF and F−EFs were observed in these cases.
Future study should investigate the partitioning of ﬂuorine
among gases, particles, and ashes during biomass burning.
Jayarathne et al. (2014) reported F−EFs in the range of
0.7–136 mg kg−1 for several types of biomass burning with
an overall average of 32 ± 7 mg kg−1. These values are in
the range of dry (7.6 ± 0.6 mg kg−1) and 25 % moisture
vegetation (17.8 ± 8.3 mg kg−1), but lower than the 50 %
moisture vegetation (744 ± 61 mg kg−1) and food discards
(291 ± 88 mg kg−1).
The
rubber
sample
had
the
highest
EF
for
HCl
(9.6 ± 1.5 g kg−1) with an order of magnitude lower EF for
PM Cl−(0.8 ± 0.2 g kg−1). Consistent with low elemental Cl
emission, the plastic bottles or bags did not have high HCl or
Cl−emissions. Lemieux (1997) reported HCl EFs of 1.51–
3.28 and 0.086–0.481 g kg−1 for combined waste materials
with higher and lower PVC mass fractions, respectively. The
EF for lower PVC waste is similar to the values for com-
bined materials (0.47 ± 0.22 g kg−1) measured in this study.
These values are lower than the 1.7–9.8 g kg−1 EFs reported
by Christian et al. (2010) for landﬁll MSW burning in Mex-
ico. Stockwell et al. (2016) measured HCl from six mixed
garbage samples and found EFs ranging from non-detectable
to 3.03 g kg−1. They also found that one sample containing
mostly plastic bags did not have detectable HCl, but another
sample dominated by hard plastics had a high HCl EF of
77.9 g kg−1, indicating the high sensitivity of HCl EFs to fuel
compositions.
Due to high volatilities, NO−
2 and NO−
3 were in the gas
phase (Fig. S5). The waste materials had low sulfur content
(Wang et al., 2023); therefore, EFs for both H2SO4 and SO2−

were low. NH3 was in gas phase because the fresh emis-
sions had not reacted with acidic gases to create PM am-
monium. Similar to HF emissions, 50 % moisture vegetation
(2.86 ± 0.16 g kg−1) and food discards (6.98 ± 1.05 g kg−1)
had the highest NH3 EFs. The NH3 EF for the combined ma-
terials was 0.23 ± 0.08 g kg−1, within the large variations of
0.94 ± 1.02 g kg−1 reported by Akagi et al. (2011). The NH3
EFs for the vegetation (0.29–2.86 g kg−1) from this study
are similar to the EFs of 0.52–2.72 g kg−1 found by Akagi
et al. (2011) for different biomass burning emissions. Low
EFs for particulate Cl−, NO−
3 , SO2−
4 , and NH+
4 were also re-
ported by Pokhrel et al. (2021) for African biomass burning
emissions.
3.4
Non-polar organic compounds
The abundances (Fig. 7) and EFs (Fig. S7) for organic
groups differ among waste materials. Higher abundances of
n-alkanes, phthalate, and PAHs are found for rubber and
plastics (Fig. 7), consistent with elevated EFs (Fig. S7). Paper
and textile emissions are dominated by n-alkanes. The high
abundance of n-alkanes and phthalates in solid waste burn-
ing is consistent with prior studies (Jayarathne et al., 2018;
Simoneit et al., 2005).
Figure 8 shows the EFs for the most abundant PAHs,
including the US EPA priority PAHs (Andersson and
Achten, 2015). The PAH distribution shows similar pat-
terns for rubber and plastic bottles/bags, with dominant
EFs and abundances (Fig. S8) found for ﬁve- and six-ring
PAHs (e.g., benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene, benzo[j + k]ﬂuoranthene,
and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene), although the relative abun-
dances for rubber differ from those for plastic bot-
tles and bags. Simoneit et al. (2005) also reported that
benzo[j + k]ﬂuoranthene (0.02 %–0.036 % of PM10 mass)
and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (0.01 %–0.024 % of PM10 mass)
were the most abundant PAHs from plastics combustion.
However, their abundances were an order of magnitude lower
than the abundances found in this study (0.1 %–0.3 % of
PM2.5 mass for both PAH species). Paper and textiles consist
mostly of four-ring PAHs, with high EFs for ﬂuoranthene,
pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and benzo[c]phenanthrene. The

Figure 8. Emission factors for PAHs.
PAH EFs for textiles were about twice those for paper. Veg-
etation and food discard burning emitted a wide range of
PAHs, and the EFs varied signiﬁcantly with moisture con-
tent.
PAH EFs from this study and those reported in the liter-
ature are compared in Table 1. Note that PAH compounds
measured in different studies may be different. The PAH EF
for paper from this study (0.051 ± 0.001 g kg−1) is in the
same range as that reported by Wu et al. (2021) but is over
an order of magnitude higher than those by Park et al. (2013)
and Hoffer et al. (2020). Hoffer et al. (2020) also reported
much lower PAH EFs for rubber but similar EFs for tex-
tiles as compared to this study. The plastic bottle PAH EF
from this study is over an order of magnitude higher than the
other studies, while the plastic bag and vegetation PAH EFs
from this study are consistent with several other studies (Ja-
yarathne et al., 2018; Hoffer et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021; An-
dreae, 2019). However, the EFs for food discards are over 10
times higher than those for vegetation. The combined waste
PAH EF from this study (0.024 ± 0.010 g kg−1) is close to
that for recycled waste (0.0235–0.0244 g kg−1) by Lemieux
(1997) and dry mixed waste (0.015 g kg−1) by Jayarathne et
al. (2018). These EFs are lower than those reported for non-
recycled waste (Lemieux, 1997) and damp mixed waste (Ja-
yarathne et al., 2018).
PAH diagnostic ratios have been used to infer PAH sources
(Ravindra et al., 2008; Harner et al., 2018); however, not
many ratios have been reported for MSW burning emissions
(James et al., 2023). Table S3 lists several common PAH
diagnostic ratios from this study. While there are similari-
ties among different materials, some distinct ratios can be
observed. For example, plastic bottles and bags have sig-
niﬁcantly (p < 0.05) higher benzo[e]pyrene/benzo[a]pyrene
and indeno[1,2,3−c,d]pyrene/benzo[g,h,i]perylene ratios;
however, they had much lower emissions of retene, which is
a biomass burning emission tracer, than other materials.

Figure 9. Emission factors for nitro-PAHs.
Figure 10. Emission factors for total PAHs and nitro-PAHs ex-
pressed in benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) toxicity equivalent.
Figures 9 and S9 show that 2-nitrobuphenyl is the most
abundant nitro-PAH for most MSW. Plastic bottles had the
highest nitro-PAH EFs, followed by food discards and rub-
ber. The dry vegetation had higher EFs than the moisture fu-
els.
The cancer risks of PAHs and nitro-PAHs are often es-
timated using the equivalents of benzo(a)pyrene (BaPeq),
one of the most potent PAHs with known carcinogenic
characteristics. The toxic equivalent factor (TEF) for BaP
is set to 1, and other PAHs and nitro-PAHs are assigned
a TEF value by comparing their relative toxicity to that
of BaP (ATSDR, 2022; Samburova et al., 2017; Moradi
et al., 2022). For PAHs, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene has the
highest TEF of 2.4, followed by BaP, benzo[e]pyrene and
dibenzo[a,e]pyrene, with a TEF of 1.0 (ATSDR, 2022; Sam-
burova et al., 2017). For nitro-PAHs, 6-nitrochrysene and
1,6-dinitropyrene have the highest TEF of 10 (ATSDR,
2022). The EFs for BaPeq (BaP toxicity equivalent) were
calculated from the sums of the products of the EF and
TEF of individual PAHs and nitro-PAHs. Figure 10 shows
that plastic bottles, rubber, and plastic bags had the high-
est PAH EFs for BaPeq, while plastic bottles, food discards,

and rubber had the highest nitro-PAH EFs for BaPeq, consis-
tent with their high EFs for PAHs and nitro-PAHs. The PAH
BaPeq EFs for paper (0.00032 ± 0.00010 g kg−1) and textiles
(0.0010 ± 0.0003 g kg−1) are in similar ranges to those re-
ported by Hoffer et al. (2020): 0.00016 ± 0.00012 g kg−1 for
paper and 0.0016 ± 0.0020 g kg−1 for textiles. However, the
PAH BaPeq EFs for rubber (0.47 ± 0.06 g kg−1) and plastic
bottles (3.0 ± 0.4 g kg−1) were over an order of magnitude
higher than the tire and plastics (0.001–0.02 g kg−1) reported
by Hoffer et al. (2020). These differences are likely caused by
the more efﬁcient oxidation by co-combustion of solid waste
with charcoal in the Hoffer et al. (2020) tests, and more PAH
species were measured and included in the BaPeq calculation
in this study.
Abundances and EFs for n-alkanes are shown in Figs. S10
and 11, respectively. The most striking preference of odd
alkanes over even alkanes was observed for the dry-
vegetation emissions, with a carbon preference index (CPI;
the ratio of the sums of odd to even carbon numbers) of
6.01 ± 0.47, consistent with literature ﬁndings (Rogge et al.,
1993; Noblet et al., 2021; Caumo et al., 2020). The higher-
than-unity CPI is due to biogenic wax emissions. The EFs for
50 % moisture vegetation were over an order of magnitude
higher than those of dry and 20 % moisture vegetation sam-
ples. However, the odd n-alkane preference was lost in emis-
sions from moist vegetation, with CPI values of 0.63 ± 0.01
and 0.75 ± 0.03 for vegetation with 20 % and 50 % moisture
content, respectively. Paper, textiles, and food discard emis-
sions also showed preference for odd n-alkanes, with CPIs of
1.80 ± 0.10, 2.39 ± 0.04, and 2.53 ± 0.21, respectively. Plas-
tic bottles had the highest EFs for n-alkanes, with C30–C32
having the highest EFs. Synthetic rubber and plastic bags had
the second- and third-highest EFs for n-alkanes.
The CPIs for plastic bottles and bags, rubber, and com-
bined waste material were less than 0.6, indicating combus-
tion of petroleum products (Rogge et al., 1993). Jayarathne

et al. (2018) reported CPIs of 0.6–1.1 for mixed waste, simi-
lar to the combined materials (0.58 ± 0.01) in this study. Si-
moneit et al. (2005) reported strong preferences for even-
carbon-number n-alkanes (CPI = 0.1–0.47) for plastic ex-
tracts, but the preference decreased (CPI = 0.68–0.98) in the
plastic burning smoke due to thermal cracking. These val-
ues are slightly higher but close to those for plastic bot-
tles (0.58 ± 0.03) and plastic bags (0.53 ± 0.02). The carbon
number maxima (Cmax) are C30 and C32 for plastic bottles
and C32 and C34 for plastic bags, consistent with the values
reported by Simoneit et al. (2005).
Phthalates can irreversibly disrupt the endocrine system,
metabolism, and multiple organs (Wang and Qian, 2021; Si-
moneit et al., 2005). Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), one
of the most common phthalates, was designated by the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a probable hu-
man carcinogen (Miao et al., 2017). EFs (Fig. 12) and percent
PM2.5 abundance (Fig. S11) for phthalates are the highest
for plastic bottles and bags, rubber, and combined materials,
consistent with phthalates’ use as plasticizing agents (Chien
et al., 2003). Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), DEHP, and di-
n-octyl phthalate (DnBP) were the phthalate species with the
highest EFs for all waste materials. Rubber had higher abun-
dances of DnBP than plastic bottles or bags. Phthalate EFs
from 50 % moisture vegetation are over an order of magni-
tude higher than the drier vegetation samples, while paper
had the lowest phthalate EFs.

components exceeded 20 % for most fuels, except for plas-
tic bags and combined fuels, which had the highest sums
of EC1 and EC2 (53 %–70 %). Cl was the most abun-
dant element in PM2.5 from all waste materials. Vegeta-
tion samples had higher abundances of K and K+, conﬁrm-
ing their use as biomass burning markers. Paper and textile
non-polar organic emissions were dominated by n-alkanes.
They had similar PAH distributions with abundant four-
ring PAHs (e.g., ﬂuoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene,
and benzo[c]phenanthrene). Rubber, plastic bottles, and
plastic bag emissions have high abundances of PAHs, n-
alkanes, and phthalates, with abundant ﬁve- and six-ring
PAHs (e.g., benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene, benzo[j + k]ﬂuoranthene,
and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene). Dry-vegetation emissions pro-
duced approximately 10-fold higher PAH abundances than
moist-vegetation fuels, with a strong preference for odd n-
alkanes and a CPI of 6.01 ± 0.47. In contrast, rubber and
plastic bottles and bags showed preference to even n-alkanes,
with CPI values less than 0.6. Rubber, plastic bottles and
bags, and combined materials had the highest abundance
of phthalates, while dry-vegetation burning had the highest
abundance of nitro-PAHs.
In term of EFs, Cl had the highest EFs among all elements
measured by XRF. Rubber had the highest EFs for particu-
late Cl and S as well as gaseous HCl due to its most abun-
dant Cl and S in the fuel. Rubber also had the highest EFs for
HAP elements (Cd, Sb, and Pb), while 50 % moisture vege-
tation had the highest EFs for Cr, Co, Ni, and Se. Food dis-
cards and 50 % moisture vegetation had the highest EFs for
HF, NH3, and particulate F−. The phthalates with the highest
EFs are BBP, DEHP, and DnBP. Plastic bottles had the high-
est EFs for nitro-PAHs, followed by food discards and rub-

Conclusions
This study provides detailed chemical speciation of ﬁlter
samples collected from laboratory combustion of 10 munic-
ipal solid waste (MSW) materials, representing open burn-
ing of household waste in South Africa. Source proﬁles and
emission factors were calculated. The key conclusions are as
follows.
Source proﬁles representative of local emission sources
are critical for accurate source apportionment (Watson et al.,
2016). This study expands conventional elements, ions, and
carbon fractions to include non-polar organic compounds
such as PAHs, nitro-PAHs, alkanes and alkenes, and phtha-
lates. The additional chemical speciation allows improve-
ment in source attributions of open waste burning in South
Africa and other regions in the world.
Emission factors derived from the combustion of local ma-
terials that represent community-generated solid waste im-
prove the accuracy of emission estimates. Emissions from
open burning of MSW are understudied for local, national,
and global emission inventories (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014)
with a dearth of measurements for waste combustion (Rabaji,
2019; Kwatala et al., 2019). This study contributes to the air
quality management and research communities by provid-
ing experimentally determined EFs for different waste mate-
rial categories speciﬁc to South Africa. These localized EFs
can be used to estimate the emission reductions for SASOL’s
WCI program and to improve MSW open-burning emission
inventories for South Africa and other countries.
EFs for chemical species provide additional information
to assess potential health risks associated with exposure to
open-burning emissions. The established chemical database
can be used for risk assessment to further demonstrate emis-
sion reductions for many air toxics (e.g., hazardous gases,
heavy metals, and PAHs) beyond criteria pollutants by reduc-
ing open waste burning. The EFs for CO2 and EC are also
useful for evaluating the climate impacts from MSW open
burning.
The EFs determined for nine individual waste categories
and the combined waste category offer ﬂexibility in calcu-
lating emissions. When the weight composition is known for
open-burn piles, emissions of chemical species can be cal-
culated by summing those from individual categories; other-
wise, the EFs for the combined categories can be used. EFs
for PM2.5 from this study are within the ranges reported in
the literature. This study ﬁlls a data gap, particularly for spe-
ciated proﬁles and EFs from burning many waste materials,
such as paper, leather/rubber, textiles, and food discards.
Results were obtained from laboratory tests simulating
real-world conditions. However, the differences in fuel mix-
tures, packing structure, moisture content, burn conditions,
dilution, and aging between laboratory and ﬁeld conditions
will cause differences in chemical compositions and EFs
(Hodshire et al., 2019). The EFs might need to be adjusted
when real-world burning conditions differ signiﬁcantly from
the test conditions used in this study.

ABSTRACT
The open burning of mixed wastes that contain plastics is a widespread practice across 
the globe, resulting in the release of gas emissions and ash residues that have toxic 
effects on human and environmental health. Although plastic pollution is under scrutiny 
as a pressing environmental concern, it is often conflated with plastic litter, and the 
contribution of the open burning of plastics to air, soil, and water pollution gets overlooked. 
Therefore, campaigns to raise awareness about plastic pollution often end up leading to 
increased open burning. Many countries or regions where open burning is prevalent have 
laws in place against the practice, but these are seldom effective. In this viewpoint, we 
direct attention to this critical but largely overlooked dimension of plastic pollution as 
an urgent global health issue. We also advocate interventions to raise awareness about 
the risks of open burning and emphasize the necessity of phasing out some particularly 
pernicious plastics in high-churn, single-use consumer applications.2

INTRODUCTION
Plastic pollution has emerged as one of our most pressing environmental challenges, and media 
coverage of plastic pollution has skyrocketed. The public has encountered two differing narratives 
in the in the media. The first narrative unfolds with images of wildlife dying after ingesting 
plastics, mountains of plastic trash on land, and plastics strewn in the ocean. The second narrative 
showcases images of clean-up campaigns and innovative plastic repurposing and recycling 
programs, creating the impression that substantial efforts to address the problem are being made. 
However, the impact of these remediation efforts is subject to debate. While these efforts reduce 
visible plastic waste in the immediate environment, raise awareness about our growing plastic 
footprint, and inspire hope, in practice, less than ten percent of plastic waste [1, 2] is recycled. 
The plastic problem is steadily intensifying and is further worsened by the practice of shipping 
post-consumer plastics collected in higher income countries to low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs) under the guise of recycling. This practice exacerbates the existing challenges LMICs face 
with their own plastic waste [3–5].
Most news reporting about plastic pollution has focused on litter as an environmental hazard to 
animals [6]. In comparison, far less media attention has been dedicated to the methods by which 
plastics are disposed and their resulting health consequences. News stories about the plastic waste 
collected locally by communities seldom specify what happens to this waste. Through our multi-
sited ethnographic fieldwork, we found that this waste is routinely burned in open fires. Ironically, 
anti-litter campaigns and initiatives raising awareness about plastic pollution often contribute to 
increased volumes of open burning, as individuals and communities burn the trash collected in 
clean-up activities [7].
OPEN BURNING OF WASTES
Approximately two billion people across the globe receive no municipal solid waste collection [8]. 
Their wastes are usually buried or dumped on land or in waterways, and more commonly, they 
are subjected to open burning [9]. The amount of plastics that get burned are estimated to be as 
high as the quantity of plastics emitted into the land or sea [10]. The scale of open burning among 
LMICs is estimated to range from 40% to 65% of total municipal solid waste [11–13]. Open burning 
is a large source of air pollutants, especially reactive trace gases and particulate matter (PM). For 
example, in China, emissions of PM 10 micrometers or less in diameter (PM10) from open domestic 
waste burning are equivalent to 22% of China’s total reported anthropogenic PM10 emissions 
[13]. When it comes to open burning, plastics are a particularly problematic waste stream. One 
study attributed 90% of black carbon emitted from burning wastes to two plastics—polyethylene 
terephthalate and polystyrene [14]. Although reliable measurements of the amount of black 
carbon released through the burning of wastes are lacking, very basic calculations have suggested 
that they are not negligible [10, 15], correlating the open burning of wastes to climate change as 
well as detrimental health effects. Some emissions, including persistent organic pollutants such as 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins and dioxin-related compounds, have been linked to 
skin lesions, cancer, immunological issues, and birth defects, among other health issues [11, 14]. 
The open burning of plastics is also associated with increased risks of heart disease, respiratory 
issues, and neurological disorders [7, 11, 12, 16–18]. The ash from open burning can contain 
dioxins, heavy metals, and other toxicants, which once settled on the ground, contaminate the 
soil, groundwater, and thus the organisms surrounding the environment and their respective food 
chains [19]. One study estimated a global mortality rate between 400,000–1,000,000 people per 
annum associated with waste mismanagement and suggested that plastic waste is likely to be 
responsible for a significant proportion of these deaths [20].
Open burning is a common practice in much of the Global South, and it occurs even in the Global 
North. With the trends of increasing global plastic production and consumption [9], it is likely that 
open burning will increase in frequency and extent. Our ethnographic fieldwork in countries such 
as India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Zambia reveals a widespread reliance on open burning, 
despite the implementation of laws against the practice.3

DOI: 10.5334/aogh.4232
Individual consumers and communities cannot be blamed for open burning practices. We found 
that trash collection is infrequent or non-existent in many neighborhoods, and if available, can be 
an economic burden for households. Often, collected wastes are transported to dumping grounds 
burdened beyond their capacities. Simultaneously, low-value post-consumer plastic wastes from 
high-income countries are shipped to LMICs under the guise of recycling, even though these wastes 
are not always recycled. Post-consumer plastic wastes are often discarded along roadsides, in 
vacant lots, or in open dumps that are quickly overrun. In all such situations, when plastic wastes 
accumulate beyond the point of being deemed a nuisance—whether in terms of contagion or 
aesthetics—they are burned in the open.
HEALTH CONSEQUENCES
The health consequences of open burning depend on the type of plastic being burned. Some 
plastics release particularly carcinogenic or toxic gases that pose significant health risks when 
burned (see Table 1) [7, 11, 13, 16]. Our fieldwork revealed that few people realize the magnitude 
of the health and environmental hazards of burning plastics, even plastics such as polyvinyl 
chloride or Styrofoam (a type of polystyrene) that release toxic dioxins, chlorinated furans, or 
styrene gas when burned in the open. The major concern voiced by interlocutors was the acrid 
smell and thick smoke from the burning of some plastics; this was considered more of a short-
term inconvenience than a long-term hazard. However, the toxicants released by burning plastics 
can linger even after the smoke and smell have dissipated. In addition, the small-scale community 
burning of mixed plastic wastes has been found to pose greater risks to human health than fires 
at large dumping grounds because of the higher frequency, higher probability of human exposure, 
and low dispersive dilution caused by ground-level emissions [21].
Pollution has been deemed responsible for 15% of all deaths and 275 million disability-adjusted life 
years in 2017 [22]. The open burning of plastic wastes is an important contributor to such pollution. 
It is also an often-missed element, i.e the open burning of domestic wastes is an emissions source 
that has not been built into mainstream emissions inventories [13, 23, 24]. Laws against open 
burning exist but have not proven effective given a lack of alternatives for safe and convenient 
disposal, the shipping of low-value plastic wastes to LMICs, and low awareness regarding the 
health and environmental risks of open burning [7]. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, anti-plastic 
pollution campaigns focusing on litter have paradoxically increased open burning as communities 
engage in clean-up activities and burn the collected waste.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Plastic pollution has been recognized in public discourse as an urgent environmental challenge, and 
there are indications that governments are under pressure to take action to address the problem. 
Consequently, a UN Treaty on plastic pollution is currently being negotiated. It is imperative that 
any global plastics treaty recognizes the open burning of plastic wastes as a key aspect of plastic 
pollution and an immediate public health concern. Despite public discourses focusing on the 
associated health risks posed by microplastics and the endocrine-disrupting chemicals used as

additives in plastics —both of which are subject to ongoing research— the open burning of plastic 
wastes should remain a paramount topic to address.
Interventions to address the open burning of mixed wastes containing plastics should not solely 
focus on community outreach programs to raise awareness of the associated risks. To increase 
efficacy, these interventions must also involve waste pickers and the informal recycling sector. 
Easily comprehensible labeling should be implemented to identify the types of consumer plastics 
that are particularly pernicious when burned, going beyond existing resin recycling codes. Crucially, 
the onus of collecting and safely disposing of those plastics should be placed on the plastic industry 
and consumer goods companies rather than on the state. At the same time, prioritizing the 
phase-out of the production of these particularly harmful types of plastics (e.g., polyvinyl chloride, 
Styrofoam) for short-term and high-churn applications is of vital importance. The implementation 
of effective policies necessitates pragmatic solutions based on systematic analysis in local 
worlds and cooperation not just between various national ministries of environment but also 
with the better-funded and agenda setting ministries of health. Furthermore, it will require the 
re-evaluation of the burden of responsibility for consumer plastic disposal, shifting it away from 
individual consumers and communities and more towards the plastic manufacturers and the 
consumer brand owners using plastic packaging.

aste management encompasses 
the avoidance, reduction, 
collection, transport, storing and 
disposal of waste products from municipal, 
health and industrial sources. Current disposal 
strategies include recycling, landfill and 
incineration.1,2
Waste management is of growing concern for 
communities globally and in Australia, with 
alternatives to traditional landfill increasingly 
being employed. Waste incinerators provide 
one alternative for reducing pressure on 
landfill. Modern incinerators are also designed 
to generate electricity, which increases their 
appeal to policymakers.3–5
Waste incinerator systems have traditionally 
been associated with emission of toxic 
pollutants, impacting human and 
environmental health. The Stockholm 
Convention provides international guidance 
on the safe management of persistent 
organic pollutants (POPs). The objective of 
the Convention is to minimise or prevent 
human exposure to POPs. It incorporates 
a precautionary and manufacturer/user 
pays approach. The guidelines cover waste 
incineration because this is a potential source 
of POPs, including dioxin-like compounds. 
Waste reduction is a key recomendation.6
Newer waste incinerator technologies 
are claimed to run more cleanly and with 
less environmental impact. Nevertheless, 
pollutants are still produced, with upgraded 
facilities requiring regular service to maintain 
emission levels. 
Despite technological advancements, 
local and global health impacts from 
waste incinerators remain a concern for 
communities where they are being built. 
Adverse health outcomes in populations 
near waste incinerators, including cancers 
and reproductive dysfunction, have been 
demonstrated in primary studies.7–12 
Unfortunately, precise evaluation of the 
health impact of waste incinerators can be 
difficult due to confounding factors, including 
pollution from industries, automobiles 
and agriculture chemicals, latency for 
carcinogenicity, subacute and delayed 
reproductive/intergenerational effects, 
mobility of populations and other factors.
This systematic review aims to identify the 
health effects on human populations living 
near waste incinerators to inform the public 
and guide policymakers, and to define 
appropriate criteria for approving current 
and future waste incinerator proposals. 
We reviewed primary studies investigating 
levels of known pollutants in human and 
environmental samples as well as the health 
effects associated with waste incineration 
pollutants.

Abstract
Introduction: Waste incineration is increasingly used to reduce waste volume and produce 
electricity. Several incinerators have recently been proposed in Australia and community 
groups are concerned about health impacts. An overview of the evidence on health effects has 
been needed. 
Method: A systematic review of English language literature for waste incinerators and health 
using PRISMA methodology. 
Results: A range of adverse health effects were identified, including significant associations 
with some neoplasia, congenital anomalies, infant deaths and miscarriage, but not for other 
diseases. Ingestion was the dominant exposure pathway for the public. Newer incinerator 
technologies may reduce exposure. 
Discussion: Despite these findings, diverse chemicals, poor study methodologies and 
inconsistent reporting of incinerator technology specifications precludes firmer conclusions 
about safety. 
Conclusion: Older incinerator technology and infrequent maintenance schedules have been 
strongly linked with adverse health effects. More recent incinerators have fewer reported ill 
effects, perhaps because of inadequate time for adverse effects to emerge. A precautionary 
approach is required. Waste minimisation is essential.
Implications for public health: Public health practitioners can offer clearer advice about 
adverse health effects from incinerators. We suggest improved research design and methods 
to make future studies more robust and comparable. We offer ideas for better policy and 
regulation.

Methods
Study inclusion criteria
This systematic review was conducted 
based on the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines.13 We included peer-
reviewed primary literature addressing health 
effects of waste incineration. Studies had to 
focus on the impacts of waste incineration on 
health risk and/or health outcomes. Papers 
had to be in English and accessible online and 
could not be protocols. 
Search criteria
Relevant papers were found through a search 
of the PubMed database from 1 January 2002 
through 31 December 2017, using the MeSH 
term ‘waste management’ AND keyword 
search terms ‘incineration’ AND ‘health’. We 
did not search ‘waste to energy’ because 
incineration more generally was our primary 
focus. To keep the volume of literature 
manageable within time limits, and to harvest 
more recent and therefore up-to-date and 
relevant studies, we set the 15-year time 
horizon. A similar search on the Science Direct 
database did not yield any additional papers. 
The reference lists of captured systematic 
reviews were examined for further papers 
that met the inclusion criteria. 
Study eligibility
Paper eligibility was evaluated independently 
against the criteria by two researchers using 
the abstracts. Disagreements were resolved 
by a third assessor. Eligibility was re-assessed 
when the full manuscript was read. The 
broader research team decided exclusions by 
majority decision.
Data extraction
Papers were randomly assigned to six group 
members to extract the following data from 
each manuscript: the study design; methods; 
country of study; incinerator properties; local 
and global health outcomes; bias; and main 
results. Study design was categorised as 
either randomised-controlled trial, cross-
sectional, case-control, cohort, case study, 
case series, simulation or ecological. Local 
health outcomes were considered as those 
that affected populations living or working 
within the vicinity of waste incineration 
facilities; whereas, global health outcomes 
(primarily health impacts of global warming 
due to waste incineration) were considered 
for more distant populations.
We further classified papers according to 
impacts on health risks or health outcomes. 
Health risks were subclassified by assessment 
method as either external (measurements 
of air, soil, water, food, etc) or internal 
(measurements of serum, urine, breast milk, 
hair, or direct effects on cells and/or DNA). 
Health outcomes were further subclassified 
as neoplasia, reproductive health and other. 
Many papers examined both health risks and 
outcomes; they were included in multiple 
groups. Each paper was evaluated for its 
assessment of bias. 
As a quality control measure, a separate 
reviewer examined 20% of papers to assess 
concordance between the different data-
extraction teams.
Grade of evidence
Each paper was graded according to the 
National Health and Medical Research Council 
(NHMRC) guidelines: A (excellent) to D 
(poor).14
Results and discussion
The identification of 93 manuscripts meeting 
criteria is detailed in Figure 1. Details are 
provided in the Supplementary File: Data 
Table. Most papers were graded low on 
NHMRC criteria; the highest grade awarded 
was C (satisfactory), see Supplementary 
File. The study designs reviewed included 
19 cohort (prospective and retrospective) 
and case-control investigations. Overall 
methodological quality was satisfactory (five

studies) to poor (14 studies), with the absence 
of randomisation and blinding as the chief 
impediments to obtaining higher grade. This 
is not a major limitation given the necessarily 
observational nature of the studies. 
The five studies assessed as satisfactory were 
based on results gained from a generalisable 
study population; they reported findings with 
valuable clinical impact (odds-ratios and risk-
ratios) and considered bias.15-19
The 74 lower-grade studies comprised cross-
sectional (42), case-study (2), longitudinal (4), 
ecological (2), simulation (19), observational 
(1) and life-cycle analysis (4) studies. Absence 
of control groups and no analysis of bias were 
the chief impediments to obtaining a higher 
grade. 
Concordance between different members of 
the data-extraction team was satisfactory at 
greater than 80%.
Overall, we identified 61 (66%) papers that 
demonstrated a significant adverse outcome 
in relation to waste incineration. Of these, 34 
(37%) showed exposure to elevated levels of 
known pollutants, nine (10%) identified an 
increased risk of developing some neoplasia, 
nine (10%) found a correlation with adverse 
reproductive outcomes, and nine (10%) found 
a link to other diseases such as hypertension 
or reduced lung function. No papers 
investigated the global health effects of waste 
incineration.
Note that, while occupational exposure is 
mentioned in some cases, this is usually as 
a comparator to local resident exposure. In 
addition, exposed workers can be sentinels for 
effects that can be sought in the wider public.
Exposure risk – external 
measurements
Fifty-five papers analysed external measures 
of exposure. Most were cross-sectional, 
ecological or simulation types. A common 
format for studies involved measuring 
plant stack emissions (or samples taken 
at different distances from stacks) and 
modelling exposure based on a mixture of 
demographics, food consumption patterns 
and weather. This was usually based on US 
EPA modelling guidelines20 to calculate 
exposure by inhalation, dermal contact, soil 
contact and ingestion. Exposure levels were 
acceptable (within local regulations) in 23 
papers, while 25 found that the exposure 
could lead to adverse outcomes and seven 
made neither judgement. Eleven of the 
55 papers found that newer incinerator 
technologies led to reduced exposure, 
either by pre- and post-analysis following 
incinerator upgrades, or via comparison of 
multiple incinerators of varying ages.
Dietary ingestion was consistently the largest 
route for toxic emission exposure. Six papers 
concluded this explicitly,21-26 while other 
studies attributed the majority of exposure 
burden to food ingestion, based on pre-
existing research.
Few studies acknowledged other potential 
sources of pollutants, despite every 
incinerator facility operating near other 
polluters: transport, factories or refineries. 
Details concerning incinerator design were 
omitted in 23 studies, precluding comparison 
of the efficacy of different stack emission 
cleaning systems and making these results 
difficult to interpret. 
Exposure risk – internal 
measurements
Thirty-six papers15,22,27-60 investigated 
exposure to waste incinerator emissions 
by measurement of body substances. 
Upon review, five were found to have 
been misclassified and were excluded 
from the analysis. This heterogeneous 
group of 31 papers measured exposure 
in a variety of ways, including cell studies 
and measurements of organic and non-
organic substances in body fluids and 
hair. Substances studied included dioxins, 
furans, heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAH). Given the diversity of 
substances and methods of measurement, 
the variability in results is unsurprising.
Findings from internal measurements
Increased levels of substances were measured 
in nearby residents and workers (who may 
also be nearby residents). 
Cell function and damage
Five papers performed cell studies, 
encompassing studies on cell viability, 
immune cell activation, markers of mutation 
and markers of oxidative damage. Of these, 
three reported significant findings. Cao et 
al.56 exposed human A459 cells to particulate 
matter from incinerator atmospheric samples 
and found increased production of reactive 
oxygen species and reduced cell viability. 
Oh et al.38 compared blood samples from 31 
waste incineration workers and 84 control 
subjects and found significantly increased 
T-cell activation in incineration workers. Leem 
et al.52 measured urinary markers of oxidative 
stress in 13 workers and 16 residents near a 
municipal waste incinerator and compared 
these to samples from 10 residents near an 
industrial waste incinerator; residents near 
the industrial incinerator had significantly 
higher markers than those near the municipal 
incinerator. The lack of control group and 
small sample size limit the utility of this 
analysis in making conclusions regarding the 
safety of municipal waste incinerators.
Dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs)
Nineteen papers assessed effects of exposure 
to concentrations of polychlorinated 
dibenzodioxins (PCDDs/dioxins) and 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs/
furans) in the human body. Of these, five 
reported significant results. Yamamoto 
et al.39 measured PCDD/PCDF blood 
concentrations in 16 incineration workers 
over an eight-year period after the closure 
of the incinerator in 1997, finding PCDD 
levels 4.7 times higher and PCDF levels 
21.2 times higher compared to the local 
farming population. Although this result 
looks alarming, the age of the incinerator 
studied may limit its applicability to the 
modern context. The impact of incinerator 
age was also demonstrated by Reis et al.,36 
who measured dioxin concentrations in 
breast milk and found significantly higher 
concentration in mothers exposed to the 
older, compared to the modern, incinerator. 
Leem et al.52 found significantly higher blood 
dioxin concentration in 10 residents near an 
industrial incinerator compared to 29 workers 
and residents near a municipal incinerator 
but did not compare these results to controls 
without exposure to incinerators. 
Chen, Su and Lee22 investigated the 
relationship between food consumption and 
blood dioxin concentration in 1,709 residents 
near 19 incinerators in Spain, finding 
significantly higher blood dioxins in those 
consuming locally grown food compared to 
those who did not (p<0.0001). Similar results 
were found in Ranzi et al.59 and Cordier et al.24 
Most other studies used residents who lived 
further away from an incinerator as a control 
group compared to residents who lived closer 
as the exposure group; distance was assumed 
to be a proxy for exposure. The dominance 
of food ingestion among exposure pathways 
potentially confounds these results, as the 
assumed ‘controls’, who in many cases only 
lived kilometres away from the ‘exposed’, may 
have eaten the same-sourced foods. Further 
meteorological conditions may carry toxins 
longer distances.61 Distance from residence to

Health impacts of waste incineration
incinerator should therefore not be regarded 
a legitimate proxy for exposure, given the 
likelihood of confounding factors leading to 
an underestimation of effect.
Heavy metals
Ten papers assessed concentrations of heavy 
metals, of which five reported statistically 
significant results. Deng et al.34 measured 
blood mercury concentrations in 35 
incinerator workers in China and 269 exposed 
local residents with 143 control subjects. After 
controlling for confounders including food 
consumption habits, they found significantly 
higher mercury levels in the incinerator 
workers and exposed group compared to 
controls (median levels 1.02 mg/L, 0.81 mg/L, 
0.70 mg/L, respectively; p<0.05). The raised 
levels in both the workers and exposed 
residents corroborates the potential problem 
of using local residents, who might consume 
the same food sources, as controls. Reis et 
al.55 measured lead concentration in hair 
and blood from 497 children living in Spain, 
finding that while significantly higher levels of 
lead were found in the exposed compared to 
the control group, lead levels were relatively 
low across the study participants, although 
the lead action level used was higher than 
in other countries. This result is consistent 
with Reis et al.,35 who also found a significant 
but mild increase in maternal and newborn 
blood lead, although the concentrations 
were all below the established action level. 
Chao and Hwang58 found significantly higher 
concentrations of urinary and blood arsenic in 
workers compared to age- and sex-matched 
residents. A modifying factor was workers’ 
use of activated carbon facemasks and 
gloves during working hours. Ranzi et al.59 
found a dose-response trend for urinary and 
serum heavy metals and PAH in their study 
of 65 subjects living near or working in an 
incinerator and with 103 controls. 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
Four papers assessed the concentrations 
of PAH, of which three reported statistically 
significant results. Oh et al.38 found urinary 
PAH metabolites were 15 and 3.5 times higher 
in incineration workers compared to the 
controls (p<0.05). This result was consistent 
with a later study performed by Ranzi et al.,59 
which found significantly higher urinary PAH 
in the exposure group compared to controls. 
Incinerator technology seems to influence the 
exposure to PAH, as demonstrated by a study 
by Ichiba et al.,32 which found significantly 
higher urinary PAH in workers at an older 
incinerator compared to a more modern one. 
Waste incinerator exposure and 
neoplasia risk
Several studies showed that local residents 
may be exposed to carcinogenic levels of 
pollutants from waste incinerator emissions. 
However, the utility of these studies in 
guiding incinerator design is limited, with 
many studies omitting crucial information 
regarding the type of incinerator design, 
specific criteria to define local residents, and 
details outlining the analysis of bias and 
confounders.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma has been associated 
with waste incinerator exposure. Floret et al.15 
studied waste incinerator exposure (since 
1971 in two locations and 1976 in another) 
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases in local 
residents compared to a control population. 
After accounting for confounders, a 
relationship was established between dioxin 
exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; 
exposure levels greater than 0.0004 pg/
m3 resulted in an odds ratio of 2.3 (95%CI 
1.4–3.8). Viel et al.62 identified a low-risk ratio 
of 1.120 (95%CI 1.002–1.251) for non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma in local residents, although only in 
females; the period studied was 1972–85.
Soft tissue sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcomas have also been linked 
to exposure to waste incinerator emissions. 
Zambon et al.63 revealed an increased risk 
of sarcoma related to exposure to a large 
variety of incinerators and waste streams. The 
only exposure associated with a significant 
odds ratio was for levels greater than 6 fg/m3 
dioxin species (OR 3.27; 95%CI 1.35–7.93). This 
studied peak exposure over the period 1972–
86. Comba et al.16 studied local residents of 
an incinerator in Mantua, Italy, and found an 
alarming odds ratio of 31.4 (95%CI 5.6–176.1) 
for sarcoma in residents within 2 km of the 
incinerator. Notably, Mantua was recognised 
for its unregulated and toxic waste streams 
through the period 1974–91. 
Bowel cancer
Ranzi et al.,64 using a cohort study, 
demonstrated bowel cancer risk increased 
in residents near a waste incinerator. After 
controlling for confounders, analysis revealed 
significant bowel cancer risk ratios for 
mortality in men (RR 2.1; 95%CI 1.1–4.4), and 
incidence in women (RR 2.0; 95%CI 1.3–3.06). 
Parodi et al.65 conducted a cross-sectional 
study linking lung cancer deaths and heavy 
metal concentrations in soil utilising a 
dispersion model. Results included increased 
risk for women with high (RR 2.14; 95%CI 
1.09–4.20) and low (RR 1.54; 95%CI 1.01–2.36) 
exposure. However, the region studied had 
multiple pollution sources not factored into 
the analysis, reducing validity of the results. 
Other cancers
Federico et al.8 performed an ecological 
study across multiple incinerators and a large 
population of exposed local residents. The 
study correlated stomach, gallbladder, lung 
and pleural cancer mortality with distance 
to incinerators. All cancer risks were above 
unity but only slightly, with an overall cancer 
mortality risk ratio of 1.06 (95%CI 1.04–1.09; 
p<0.0001). Viel et al.17 found women aged 
over 60 years in the highest exposure bracket 
were actually less likely to be diagnosed 
with invasive breast cancer (OR 0.31; 95%CI 
0.08–0.89); however, this study had limited 
technical incinerator detail.
Several studies showed no association of 
cancer risk to waste incinerator exposure. In 
Japan, Fukuda et al.9 reported that cancers 
in residents near waste incinerators had no 
significant relationship to dioxin exposure 
across a large variety of exposure periods. 
Additionally, Domingo et al.66 performed a 
case study that sampled and then modelled 
air and soil pollutant levels in the vicinity 
of waste incinerators. They concluded that 
carcinogenic risk from waste incinerators was 
similar to background levels in any industrial 
or urban area, suggesting that, while waste 
incineration is at most not worse than 
traditional industrial and urban pollution 
sources, this level of exposure would add to 
the historical baseline level. Finally, Garcia-
Perez et al.18 performed an ecological study of 
two incinerators and were unable to identify 
a spatial trend between cancer incidence 
and proximity to incinerator. These studies 
suggest that relationships between proximity 
and effects may be neither direct nor linear.
Overall, results relating to neoplasia were 
mixed. This is unsurprising given that many 
use proximity to the incinerator as the 
independent variable, despite the limitations 
of this approach described earlier. Further, 
most papers omitted pertinent details on 
incinerator design, and several statistically 
significant results were inconsequential as 
they approached unity. Nevertheless, the 
seriousness of neoplasia diagnoses warrants 
a precautionary approach to incinerator 
exposure. Further, earlier periods of exposure 
have a stronger link with cancers such as non-
Hodgkin lymphoma and sarcoma.

Reproductive outcomes
Eleven eligible studies11,12,24,38,49,67-72 examined 
the effects of waste incinerator exposure on 
a wide range of reproductive outcomes. Nine 
of these found significant adverse effects, 
including preterm delivery, reduced sperm 
quantity and quality, congenital anomalies, 
infant deaths, and miscarriage.
Preterm delivery
All three studies examining preterm delivery 
demonstrated an association between 
exposure to pollutants from incinerators and 
preterm and earlier gestational age at birth. 
Santoro et al.12 performed a cross-sectional 
study of 3,153 births from 2001 to 2010 near 
an incinerator in Italy and found that, after 
adjusting for confounders, there was an 
increased risk of preterm birth in primiparous 
women (OR 2.18; 95%CI 1.05–4.53; p=0.033). 
This result was consistent with a larger study 
of 21,157 births conducted by Candela et 
al.,67 which found that increased exposure 
to particulate matter from eight incinerators 
in Italy was significantly associated with 
an increase in preterm delivery (OR 1.30; 
95%CI 1.08–1.57; p<0.001), as well as for very 
preterm babies (OR 1.44; 95%CI 1.11–1.85; 
p<0.001). Lin, Li and Mao49 found a small 
reduction in gestational age at birth in 
exposed groups. Although statistically 
significant, the effect size was tiny (0.09 
weeks). Overall, these results suggest an 
association between exposure to incinerator 
pollutants and preterm birth, but further 
research is required to rule out potential 
confounders relating to location and time 
frame used in the first two studies.
Sperm analysis
Oh et al.38 conducted a cross-sectional 
comparison of sperm count and motility 
for six waste incineration workers and eight 
controls and found that the sperm count 
was significantly lower in waste incineration 
workers compared to the control subjects 
(p=0.05). The authors also found that the 
incineration workers had more DNA damage 
in their spermatozoa compared to the 
controls (mean olive tail moment 1.40 vs. 1.26, 
p<0.001). The small sample size and lack of 
adjustment for confounding factors limit the 
utility and generalisability of this study.
Congenital anomalies
Five studies investigated congenital 
anomalies, with four finding a significant 
association between exposure to pollutants 
from incinerators and increased risk of 
congenital anomalies. These significant 
results included lethal heart and neural tube 
defects, facial clefts and renal tract defects, 
as well as infant death with congenital 
anomalies. 
A retrospective cohort study by Dummer, 
Dickinson and Parker70 used population 
registries to collect data on 244,758 births in 
the UK between 1956 and 1993 and found 
a significantly increased risk of lethal heart 
defects (OR 1.12; 95%CI 1.03–1.22; p<0.01) 
and lethal neural tube defects (OR 1.12; 
95%CI 1.07–1.28; p<0.01) among births in 
closer proximity to incinerators. Although the 
large size of this study increases its value, the 
study period might limit its applicability to 
the modern context. 
More recent studies have confirmed an 
association between incinerators and 
congenital anomalies. A retrospective cohort 
study by Tango et al.69 found a dose-response 
association for infant deaths from congenital 
malformations for births in Japan between 
1997 and 1998 in areas near incinerators 
with higher compared to lower soil dioxin 
levels (p=0.047). Cordier et al.68 conducted 
a retrospective cohort study in France using 
data from 1988–97 and found increased 
frequency of facial clefts (RR 1.30; 95%CI 
1.06–1.59) and renal dysplasia (RR 1.55; 
95%CI 1.10–1.20) in the incinerator-exposed 
communities. Additionally, a dose-response 
association of increased risk of obstructive 
uropathies was observed between the low, 
medium and high exposure groups (RR 1, 
1.38 and 1.93 respectively). Cordier et al.24 
followed this up with a case-control study in 
which cases of renal/urinary tract anomalies 
were matched with controls and assessed 
for exposure to incinerators. This study 
controlled extensively for environmental, 
social and individual confounders and found 
significantly increased risk of renal/urinary 
tract birth defects linked to higher exposure 
from incinerator-produced atmospheric 
dioxins (OR 2.84, 95%CI 1.32–6.09) and dioxin 
deposits (OR 2.95; 95%CI 1.47–5.92). The 
effect size and more rigorous study design 
provides stronger evidence for an association 
between exposure to incinerators and renal/
urinary tract congenital anomalies.
Miscarriage
Four studies looked at miscarriage and 
stillbirth; however, only one found a 
significant association with exposure to 
incinerator emissions. This cross-sectional 
study by Candela et al.11 used population 
registries and hospital records and found 
increased risk of hospitalisation for 
miscarriage among women without previous 
miscarriages with a higher compared to lower 
exposure based on incinerator dispersion 
modelling (OR 1.29; 95%CI 0.97–1.72; 
p=0.042). They also modelled alternative 
exposure sources. The use of hospital records 
did not capture the women who were not 
surgically managed for their miscarriage and 
the strength of the association is limited due 
to the odds ratio crossing unity. Moreover, 
since the study design was based on EPA 
dispersion modelling, not real-world emission 
sampling, the result may underestimate the 
true effect size.
Dioxins interfere with several biological 
processes that are key to embryonic and 
foetal development and are causally linked 
to poor birth outcomes. The associations 
found here can be partially explained 
through a teratogenic pathway. Dioxins, 
particulate matter and heavy metals, 
all emitted by incinerators, are known 
teratogens,73,74 demonstrating plausibility 
for a causal link between waste incinerators 
and congenital anomalies and miscarriage. 
The association between incinerators and 
preterm birth, however, demonstrates that 
dioxin teratogenicity does not account for all 
adverse reproductive outcomes associated 
with waste incinerators. Other possible 
links include effects of dioxins on placental 
development and function75 as well as 
endocrine signalling.76,77
Overall, the literature demonstrates 
increased risk of adverse reproductive 
outcomes associated with exposure to 
waste incinerators, in particular preterm 
birth and congenital anomalies. Conversely, 
no significant association appeared for sex 
ratio,12,67,69 birth weight,12,49,67,69 small for 
gestational age12,67 and neonatal death.69,70 
Nevertheless, the outcomes for which a 
significant association was found represent 
severe and potentially tragic health and 
personal implications, which warrant careful 
consideration and planning to mitigate risks 
from proposed waste incinerator facilities in 
Australia.
Other diseases
Seventeen eligible studies examined waste 
incinerator impacts on a range of other 
health outcomes. Adverse health effects, 
including on overall mortality and burden of 
disease, cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, 
dermatologic, childhood developmental 
delay and mental health (see Supplementary 
File) were absent or insignificant.

Overall mortality and burden of disease
Epidemiological studies in Japan9 and 
Italy64 showed no increased all-cause 
mortality associated with living in proximity 
to incinerators and increased exposure to 
dioxins, oxides of nitrogen or heavy metal 
emissions from waste incinerator facilities. 
Galise et al.78 modelled a 0.12% increase 
in overall deaths in the studied region 
attributable to fine particle (PM10, <10µm in 
diameter) exposure, while Li et al.79 concluded 
waste-to-energy incineration had the lowest 
non-cancer risks under normal operation but 
carried the highest cancer risk in comparison 
to other waste management strategies. 
Kim et al.80 calculated the burden of disease 
(measured in years of life lost and disability-
adjusted life years) in populations close to 
waste incinerators in Korea to be small.
Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity
Fukuda et al.9 demonstrated no evidence 
of increased ischemic heart disease-related 
mortality in surrounding populations with 
adjustment for socioeconomic status, while 
Ranzi et al.64 inferred no clear trends for 
increased cardiovascular or ischemic heart 
disease mortality in those exposed to heavy 
metals or living near incinerators regardless 
of adjustment for co-exposure with oxides of 
nitrogen.
Galise et al.78 modelling attributed a 0.19% 
(95%CI 0.11–0.28) increase in cardiovascular 
mortality and 0.06% (95%CI 0.00–0.12) of 
heart disease-related hospital admissions 
to potential exposure to 40µg/m3 of PM10 
incinerator emissions; these are very low 
increases in risk ratios. Contrastingly, Chen et 
al.81 demonstrated a significant association 
between serum dioxin levels and the 
occurrence of hypertension (OR 5.58; 95%CI 
1.63–19.62; p=0.007) among populations 
living close to incinerators.
Respiratory mortality and lung function 
impairment 
Galise et al.78 demonstrated a 0.27% 
respiratory mortality and 0.12% hospital 
admission rate to PM10 incinerator emissions 
(95%CI 0.11–0.42, 0.04–0.23, respectively), 
while Ranzi et al.64 ruled out any increase 
in mortality or hospital admissions due to 
lung diseases and COPD among residents in 
proximity to incinerators compared with a 
reference population. 
Studies by Hours et al.82 and Charbotel et al.19 
both demonstrated significant impairment 
of lung function among incinerator workers. 
However, only Hours et al. were able to 
demonstrate a correlation between lung 
function impairment and occupational 
pollutant exposure. Hazucha et al.83 were not 
able to demonstrate a similar link between 
paired resident and control communities. 
Metabolic syndrome and endocrine 
disorder
Chen et al.81 investigated serum dioxin 
levels and biochemical abnormalities in 
residents living close to incinerators. The 
study demonstrated elevated blood glucose 
levels (p=0.003), blood urea/nitrogen 
(p=0.003) and uric acid (p=0.019) with no 
significant association to diabetes mellites 
(p=0.07) and gout. In addition, there was no 
evidence for any correlation between dioxin 
exposure and anaemia, gallstones, goitres or 
hyperthyroidism.
Similarly, Yamamoto et al.84 found that blood 
dioxin levels among incinerator workers 
did not differ from the general Japanese 
population. Increased HbA1C levels were 
shown to correlate with blood dioxin level 
among incinerator workers; however, the 
prevalence of diabetes among incinerator 
workers was similar to that in the general 
population.
Yoshida et al.30 found a positive correlation 
between serum oestradiol (E3) and dioxin 
levels, but no difference in the oestrone (E1) 
urinary metabolite after adjustment for age, 
BMI, smoking and alcohol consumption. The 
authors of this paper did not comment on 
the potential health outcomes associated 
with elevated levels of oestrogen; hence the 
finding is of uncertain clinical consequence.
Dermatological symptoms
A study by Chen et al.81 showed that exposure 
to dioxins was protective against dermal 
allergies (OR 0.29; 95%CI 0.09–0.91; p=0.034) 
in populations living near incinerators. 
Conversely, Oh et al.82 showed significantly 
more subjectively and objectively reported 
skin lesions compared with controls with 
a dose-dependent relationship (moderate 
occupational exposure: OR 4.85; 95%CI 
2.04–11.51 and high occupational exposure: 
OR 5.03; 95%CI 2.00–12.67). No relationship 
between distance of Japanese schools 
from waste incinerators and incidence of 
atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis was 
demonstrated in students.85
Childhood wellbeing
Lung et al.86 identified an increased risk of 
mild-to-moderate developmental delay at 
ages six months and 36 months in Taiwanese 
children living near incinerators compared 
to control populations with adjustment for 
socioeconomic status. Miyake et al.85 analysed 
residential proximity to a waste incinerator 
and parent-reported illness and symptoms 
in elementary school children. Living in 
proximity to a municipal waste incinerator 
was independently associated with increased 
prevalence of wheeze (adjusted OR 1.08; 
95%CI 1.01–1.15), headache (adjusted 
OR 1.05; 95%CI 1.00–1.11), stomach ache 
(adjusted OR 1.06; 95%CI 1.01–1.11) and 
fatigue (adjusted OR 1.12; 95%CI 1.08–1.17).
Mental health
Only one study investigated stress levels 
secondary to the fear of occupational 
exposure to dioxins among municipal solid 
waste incinerator workers, which was lower 
than the general stress experienced by office 
workers.87
In vitro and in vivo oxidative stress
Chronic oxidative stress has been implicated 
in ischemic heart disease, carcinogenesis 
and respiratory disease. Yoshida et al.88 
investigated the duration of employment 
of incinerator workers in Japan and levels 
of serum and urine markers of oxidative 
stress. The marker of systemic oxidative 
stress did not correlate with job duration, 
while the level of urinary 8-hydroxy-2’-
deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA 
damage, had a positive correlation with 
length of employment, after adjustment 
for alcohol consumption, smoking and age 
(p<0.05). However, the relation to disease risk 
is uncertain.
Overall, negative health outcomes were 
demonstrated by a reduction in measured 
lung function parameters in incinerator 
workers. Out of three studies looking at the 
effects of incineration-associated pollution on 
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, only 
one showed a significant association between 
serum dioxin levels and hypertension. As 
such, the contribution of incinerators to 
cardiovascular disease risk is undetermined. 
The impact of incinerator pollution on 
metabolic function was demonstrated by an 
elevation of blood glucose levels, without an 
increased risk of diabetes mellitus. Regarding 
dermatologic symptoms, conflicting results 
were demonstrated among incinerator 
workers, paediatric and general populations 
in both self-reported and objectively 
measured lesions. Therefore, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn.

Limitations
Definitive studies on the link between 
waste incineration and health are difficult 
to conduct due to the diversity of pollutants 
emitted, and the complex nature of disease 
aetiology and pathophysiology. This 
problem is exacerbated by multiple exposure 
routes, experimental design limitations, 
unpredictable and indeterminable weather 
patterns, confluent and unmeasured 
alternative sources of pollution, unspecified 
incinerator design elements and cleaning 
systems used, unknown maintenance 
schedules and unrecorded content of waste 
streams. Proximity of incinerators to the 
local populace, number of years lived near 
incinerator, water and food sources and 
consumption patterns introduce a third set of 
uncontrolled confounders.
Bias and study design affected robustness 
of results. Exposure misclassification was 
a recurring, undefined weakness. Control 
groups were often poorly matched to 
experimental groups. Not all studies 
reported confounders; for example: 
migration trends, places of occupation 
and other factors (smoking, alcohol, diet, 
education, occupation, time spent inside/
outside incinerator among workers, age, sex, 
household condition, urban/rural status, 
overall health status, breast feeding status 
and route of toxin contact [dermal, inhalation, 
ingestion]) were variably reported. Where 
reported, none of these had significant effect 
on health outcome. Use of distance as a proxy 
for exposure, lack of control groups, small 
sample sizes and an inability to establish 
a causal relationship weakened ability to 
draw firm conclusions. Given the diversity of 
exposure and dispersal routes, it is not clear 
how important socioeconomic status would 
be as a confounder.
The diversity found in the literature suggests 
the true neoplasia risk remains obscure, and 
evidence implies exposure to incinerators 
increases risk of cellular damage due to intake 
of dioxins, furans, metals and polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons. The variation in 
results between studies measuring different 
exposures and different risks suggests that 
at least some waste incinerators are likely 
to increase the risk of at least some types of 
neoplasia. 
One limitation of any review like this is the 
possibility of data dredging. If widespread, it 
would create the appearance of a causal link 
between waste incineration and ill health. 
The risk may be low in this study because 
there is a presumptive link between waste 
incineration and ill health. This means that 
a study not finding a connection would be 
approximately as notable as one finding a 
connection.
Despite ingestion being considered the 
primary exposure route in the literature that 
specifically examines this variable, most 
studies only considered inhalation and 
dermal exposure to pollutants in their study 
design.
Incinerator design specifics were often 
omitted from papers and detail about waste 
streams and stack emission treatments were 
inconsistent, making comparisons of different 
design elements and systematic comparison 
of results difficult.
Waste incinerator designs have changed 
over the past decades and papers comparing 
emissions from an incinerator before and 
after upgrade mostly showed significant 
reductions in measured pollutant levels. Older 
incinerator technologies featured in most 
studies, therefore subsequent improvements 
in incinerator technologies may mean these 
results will not accurately represent the 
health consequences of exposure to current 
incinerators. However, since many health 
effects require cumulative exposure and may 
take many years to manifest, it will be difficult 
to measure any improved safety from modern 
incinerator designs for decades. 
Finally, compared to other energy sources, the 
financial costs of waste to energy are high.89 
Further building reliance on maintaining 
a waste stream for supply of material 
counteracts the imperative to reduce waste.
Implications for public health
Based on this review, we provide researchers 
with suggestions for design and methods 
that will make future studies more robust and 
their results better comparable. Additionally, 
public health practitioners can offer the 
public, policy makers and regulators clearer 
advice about incinerator safety.
Future studies
This review has revealed substantial gaps 
and inconsistencies. These preclude clear 
assessment of which incinerator-related 
variables are important for health impacts. 
Future studies should: 
• include information on the waste, 
including content and volume, incinerator 
technical characteristics such as stack 
height, type of combustion chamber, stack 
cleaning mechanisms and maintenance 
schedules, and the types and quantities of 
emissions; 
• where possible, analyse or control for three 
exposure pathways: ingestion, inhalation 
and dermal exposure. The possible lack 
of correlation between distance from the 
incinerator and the intensity of all three of 
the pathways should guide study design 
and interpretation of results; 
• report a range of variables potentially 
related to health effects;
• control for or account for absence of 
control for likely confounders; and
• determine whether those living downwind 
of incinerators are at risk.
Finally, further research is needed to compare 
different incinerator designs, and incineration 
with other methods of waste management. 
This will allow more rigorous and meaningful 
comparisons between waste disposal options. 
Policy and regulation
• Since there has been insufficient time 
for health effects of newer technology 
to emerge, a precautionary approach to 
licensing and monitoring incinerators must 
continue. 
• As a condition of applying for a licence 
to build waste incinerators, independent 
third-party conducted baseline population 
studies and long-term surveillance cohort 
studies be mandated to measure the 
longitudinal and emerging effects of 
the incinerator’s presence on the local 
community and the environment. 
• Health and safety standards for workers 
should be enshrined in law and should 
include regular health checks and exposure 
monitoring.
• In countries that have ratified the 
Stockholm Convention, incinerators should 
be designed to meet the Convention 
guidelines.
• Facility upgrades and regular maintenance 
schedules for incinerators must be adhered 
to. 
• New incinerators should be located away 
from areas of food production. 
• Food grown near an incinerator should be 
avoided.
Conclusion
This is the first systematic review that links the 
literature on exposure assessments (internal 
and external toxin measurements) to health

outcomes. While we recognise that all studies 
discovered had limitations (only five reached 
NHMRC criterion C), this review permits 
assessment of incinerator safety.
This review shows contamination of food 
and ingestion of pollutants is a significant 
risk pathway for both nearby and distant 
residents. While occupationally exposed 
groups have been shown in primary studies 
to most likely suffer adverse effects, they are a 
relatively smaller population than all residents 
in the vicinity of incinerators. Workers may be 
considered a sentinel population for adverse 
effects. Incinerator workers are probably also 
local residents so also subject to exposures 
outside the workplace. Both local residents 
ingesting food grown in close proximity 
to incinerators, as well as more distant 
populations consuming food transported 
from areas near an incinerator, are open to 
exposure. Because most studies in this review 
examined only a small subset of potential 
exposure and disease pathways, together 
with the low quality, it is likely that our review 
has ‘under-discovered’ the full health-effects 
picture.
This systematic review highlights significant 
risks associated with waste incineration as 
a form of waste management. Many older 
incinerators were linked with neoplasia, 
reproductive issues and other diseases. 
While the results were not consistent across 
the literature, based on a precautionary 
principle there is insufficient evidence to 
conclude that any incinerator is safe. There 
is some suggestion that newer incinerator 
technologies with robust maintenance 
schedules may be less harmful, but diseases 
from exposures tend to manifest only after 
many years of cumulative exposure, so it 
is premature to conclude that these newer 
technologies improve safety. 
Incineration for waste management, 
including waste-to-energy options, is likely 
to remain an alternative that governments 
will consider. However, the financial and 
ecological costs of waste to energy are 
comparably high. Building reliance on a 
waste stream for energy counters the need 
to reduce waste overall. This review suggests 
that incineration is not without problems and 
so it is an option that needs to be pursued 
carefully with close monitoring. Local 
community groups have a basis for legitimate 
concern and so siting of incineration 
facilities needs to take these concerns into 
account. Early transparent consultation with 
communities about these facilities is essential.

Introduction
Wildfires are a global occurrence. Changes 
in temperature and precipitation patterns 
from climate change are increasing wildfire 
prevalence and severity (Westerling et al. 
2006; Settele et  al. 2014) resulting in 
longer fire seasons (Flannigan et al. 2013; 
Westerling et al. 2006) and larger geographic 
area burned (Gillett et al. 2004). Wildfire 
smoke contains many air pollutants of 
concern for public health, such as carbon 
monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, 
particulate matter (PM), polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and volatile organic 
compounds (Naeher et al. 2007). Current 
estimated annual global premature mortality 
attributed to wildfire smoke is 339,000 
(interquartile range of sensitivity analyses: 
260,000–600,000) (Johnston et al. 2012), 
but the overall impact on public health in 
terms of respiratory, cardiovascular, and 
other morbidity effects is unknown. A better 
synthesis of current knowledge on the health 
effects of wildfire smoke is needed to guide 
public health responses.
Wildfire smoke epidemiology is an active 
area of research (Henderson and Johnston 
2012) with new methods uncovering 
associations that were previously undetect-
able. Studies of health outcomes associated 
with wildfire smoke exposure tend to be 
retrospective and researchers have to rely on 
administrative health outcome data such as 
mortality or hospitalization records. Achieving 
adequate statistical power has been chal-
lenging because such severe outcomes are 
less common, fires tend to be episodic and 
short in duration, and exposed populations 
from individual events are often small. Many 
recent studies have increased statistical power 
by investigating very high exposure events 
that last for longer periods, large populations 
over many years in regions with frequent 
fires, more common health outcomes such as 
medication ­dispensations, or a combination of 
these methods.
Previous reviews of wildfire health impacts 
have either not included the full range of 
health end points associated with community 
exposure to wildfire smoke (Dennekamp and 
Abramson 2011; Henderson and Johnston 
2012) or have summarized the literature 
without critical analysis of specific studies 
(Finlay et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015; Youssouf 
et al. 2014). Our review follows a modified 
version of the systematic review methodology 
outlined in Woodruff and Sutton (2014) to 
analyze studies critically and to only evaluate 
the strongest evidence.
Methods
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and 
PsychInfo to identify scientific papers related 
to wildfire smoke exposure and relevant 
health outcomes. We conceptualized wildfires 
as those within the definition of landscape 
fires defined in Johnston et al. (2012). Our 
search strategy (Figure 1) yielded 778 journal 
articles in PubMed and 1,248 journal articles 
in Web of Science in November 2013. We 
then selected studies that potentially focused 
on human health effects related to wildfire 
smoke based on title and yielded 248 journal 
articles from PubMed and 217 from Web 
of Science. After discarding duplicates, 350 
articles remained. PsychInfo did not yield any 
new peer-reviewed journal articles.
After reading abstracts, we removed 
articles if they assessed only exposure and 
not associated health effects, reported health 
surveillance outcomes without analysis of 
associations with exposure, did not analyze 
primary or secondary health data, did not 
adequately describe the exposure assessment 
or it was not clearly related to wildfire smoke, 
or were not published fully in English. This

Background: Wildfire activity is predicted to increase in many parts of the world due to changes 
in temperature and precipitation patterns from global climate change. Wildfire smoke contains 
numerous hazardous air pollutants and many studies have documented population health effects 
from this exposure.
Objectives: We aimed to assess the evidence of health effects from exposure to wildfire smoke and 
to identify susceptible populations.
Methods: We reviewed the scientific literature for studies of wildfire smoke exposure on mortality 
and on respiratory, cardiovascular, mental, and perinatal health. Within those reviewed papers 
deemed to have minimal risk of bias, we assessed the coherence and consistency of findings.
Discussion: Consistent evidence documents associations between wildfire smoke exposure and 
general respiratory health effects, specifically exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease. Growing evidence suggests associations with increased risk of respiratory infec-
tions and all-cause mortality. Evidence for cardiovascular effects is mixed, but a few recent studies 
have reported associations for specific cardiovascular end points. Insufficient research exists to 
identify specific population subgroups that are more susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure.
Conclusions: Consistent evidence from a large number of studies indicates that wildfire smoke 
exposure is associated with respiratory morbidity with growing evidence supporting an association 
with all-cause mortality. More research is needed to clarify which causes of mortality may be associ-
ated with wildfire smoke, whether cardiovascular outcomes are associated with wildfire smoke, and 
if certain populations are more susceptible.

yielded 103 studies that we reviewed. We 
continually searched for new papers and 
subsequently added 12 more by August 2015. 
These papers included human experimental 
studies of woodsmoke, studies of effects 
on wildland firefighters, and studies whose 
outcomes were self-reported respiratory 
symptoms associated with wildfire smoke, but 
these are not included in this paper.
From the remaining epidemiological 
studies (N = 53), we extracted information 
and made an expert judgment on the risk 
of bias for each study based on their sample 
size, exposure assessment methods, control 
for potential confounding factors, and use of 
objective outcome measures (see Table S1). 
We deemed studies to have a lower risk of 
bias if there were no concerns in any of these 
categories, moderate risk if there were minor 
concerns in one or more categories, and higher 
risk if either there were multiple concerns 
about bias or if one concern was sufficiently 
large based on our collective judgment.
All evaluation of results from these studies 
is based on the authors’ interpretation of the 
reported findings in each paper. In this review 
“significant” means a 95% confidence interval 
(CI) that does not include the null, “sugges-
tive” means a 95% CI that does include the 
null but would not with a slightly relaxed crite-
rion such as a 90% CI, and “no association” 
means that the 95% CI includes the null with 
no indication of a relationship. We assumed 
that exposure to smoke from all types of land-
scape fires were comparable. We use the term 
wildfire to refer to all types of landscape fires.
Assessing human exposure to wildfire 
smoke is challenging for many reasons. 
Wildfires tend to occur in rural areas in which 
air pollution monitoring networks might be 
absent or less comprehensive than in cities. 
The studies we reviewed used various exposure 
assignment methods such as self-report, 
assignment to the nearest regulatory air pollu-
tion monitor, comparison of fire periods to 
non-fire periods, and use of satellite data or 
air quality modeling output. Heterogeneity 
of exposure assessment methods across 
studies (Table 1; see also Table S1) made a 
quantitative meta-analysis of effect estimates 
­inappropriate. While publication bias could be 
present in this literature, we could not assess 
its extent due to the scarcity of studies for each 
health outcome.
Results
Our review covers the following health 
outcomes: mortality, respiratory morbidity, 
cardiovascular morbidity, birth outcomes, and 
mental health. We further discuss the evidence 
from toxicological studies and for susceptible 
population subgroups. Table S1 provides 
more details on reviewed studies.
After review of 53 epidemiological papers, 
we evaluated 27 as having lower potential 
for bias, 17 as moderate potential for bias 
and 10 as higher potential for bias. Of the 
10 deemed to have higher risk of bias, 4 did 
not adequately adjust for important covari-
ates (Azevedo et al. 2011; Cooper et al. 1994; 
Prass et al. 2012; Resnick et al. 2015), 2 were 
likely underpowered due to small sample size 
(Cooper et al. 1994; Vedal and Dutton 2006), 
3 used retrospective self-report for exposure 
assessment with high potential for bias (Ho 
et al. 2014; McDermott et al. 2005; Marshall 
et al. 2007), and the exposure assessment 
in 2 other studies was not clearly related to 
smoke from wildfires (Analitis et al. 2012, 
Caamano-Isorna et al. 2011). The remaining 
43 studies deemed to have low to moderate 
risk of bias are discussed below. More detail

Mortality
Growing evidence from the more recent, 
adequately statistically powered studies 
demonstrates associations between wildfire 
smoke exposure and all-cause mortality, but 
more studies are needed to determine whether 
specific causes of mortality are most affected.
A study of the 1997 southeast Asian 
wildfire found an increase in mortality 
in Malaysia associated with a measure of 
visibility and measured PM10 (PM ≤ 10 μm 
in aerodynamic diameter) both linearly and 
with various discrete levels of PM10 (Sastry 
2002). A study of the 2010 heat wave and 
wildfires in Moscow reported findings of an 
interaction between high temperatures and 
high PM10 on deaths and that smoke exposure 
was responsible for about 29% of the 10,859 
excess deaths during the 44-day heat wave 
(Shaposhnikov et al. 2014). A cross-sectional 
analysis of cardiovascular mortality among 
people older than 65 years in the Brazilian 
Amazon, where the predominant source of air 
pollution is from wildfires, found a significant 
association between the percentage of hours 
of PM2.5 over 25 μg/m3 and cardiovascular 
mortality (Nunes et al. 2013).
The most recent studies of wildfire smoke 
and mortality take advantage of long time 
series data and provide growing evidence of 
significant increases in mortality. A study of 
13.5 years of data including 48 days affected by 
wildfire smoke in Sydney, Australia, demon-
strated a significant increase in mortality 
associated with smoke-affected days (Johnston 
et al. 2011). An earlier study of mortality in 
Sydney, using 8 years of data, found a sugges-
tive increase in mortality associated with 
wildfire-related PM10 (Morgan et al. 2010). 
A meta-analysis of data from 2003 to 2010 in 
10 cities in southern Europe found increases 
in cardiovascular mortality associated with 
PM10 that were stronger on smoke-affected 
days than on non-affected days, but smoke was 
not significantly associated with respiratory 
mortality (Faustini et al. 2015). In Madrid, 
mortality, but not specifically respiratory or 
cardiovascular mortality, was associated with 
PM10 on days with advection events associated 
with biomass burning (Linares et al. 2015). 
Further multi-year studies in regions regularly 
affected by wildfire smoke could help clarify if 
specific causes of mortality are associated with 
wildfire smoke exposure.
Respiratory Morbidity
Epidemiological studies have demonstrated 
significant associations between wildfire 
smoke exposure and declines in lung function 
among non-asthmatic children (Jacobson 
et al. 2012, 2014), and increases in physician

et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2009; Moore et al. 
2006; Mott et al. 2002), respiratory emer-
gency department (ED) visits (Johnston

2009; Thelen et al. 2013) and respiratory 
hospitalizations (Cançado et al. 2006; Chen 
et al. 2006; Delfino et al. 2009; Henderson 
et al. 2011; Ignotti et al. 2010; Martin et al. 
2013; Morgan et al. 2010; Mott et al. 2005). 
Findings for specific respiratory end points 
are reviewed below.
Asthma. Evidence from multiple epide-
miological studies demonstrates that wildfire 
smoke exposure contributes to exacerba-
tions of asthma. Studies have documented 
increased physician visits (Henderson et al. 
2011; Yao et al. 2016), ED visits (Duclos 
et  al. 1990; Johnston et  al. 2002, 2014; 
Rappold et al. 2011) and hospitalizations 
(Arbex et al. 2007; Delfino et al. 2009; Martin 
et al. 2013; Morgan et al. 2010; Mott et al. 
2005) for asthma associated with wildfire 
smoke exposure. Some studies found sugges-
tive increases in asthma ED visits (Smith 
et al. 1996) and asthma hospital admissions 
(Johnston et al. 2007); these studies may have 
lacked statistical power due to short time 
periods (Smith et al. 1996) or small affected 
populations (Johnston et al. 2007). Another 
study did not find a significant increase in ED 
visits or hospitalizations among a cohort of 
asthmatic children in the year after large wild-
fires in San Diego, California, compared to the 
year prior to those fires (Tse et al. 2015).
Four studies demonstrated no signifi-
cant acute changes in lung function among 
people with asthma related to PM from 
wildfires (Jacobson et al. 2012; Jalaludin 
et al. 2000; Vora et al. 2011; Wiwatanadate 
and Liwsrisakun 2011), although significant 
declines in lung function were found among 
those without asthma (Jacobson et al. 2012) 
and children without bronchial hyper-
reactivity (Jalaludin et al. 2000). One possible 
explanation for these counter-intuitive 
findings is increased use of rescue medica-
tion in response to elevated levels of smoke 
among those diagnosed with asthma as was 
found in one (Vora et al. 2011) of two studies 
(Vora et al. 2011; Jacobson et al. 2012) that 
­investigated this mechanism.
Other studies documented associations 
between medication usage for obstructive 
lung disease and wildfire smoke exposure. 
Both usage of reliever medication and initia-
tion of oral steroid use were associated with 
wildfire smoke in a panel study of adults and 
children in Australia (Johnston et al. 2006). 
People with asthma reported elevated levels 
of rescue medication usage during a wildfire 
in Southern California (Vora et al. 2011). 
Dispensations of reliever medications were 
related to metrics of wildfire smoke exposure

in British Columbia (Elliott et al. 2013; Yao 
et al. 2016). Researchers found increases in 
physician-dispensed short-acting beta-agonists 
but not physician-prescribed oral cortico-
steroids for children with asthma in years 
after two catastrophic wildfires in southern 
California compared to the year prior to 
each wildfire (Tse et al. 2015). An associa-
tion between visits to hospitals for inhalation 
therapy and daily mass of air particle sediment 
collected in four nearby water containers was 
found during one sugarcane-burning season in 
Brazil (Arbex et al. 2000).
All previously mentioned studies examined 
exacerbations of asthma, whereas only one 
study investigated incident asthma related to 
wildfire smoke. Methodological concerns in 
that portion of the study suggest a high poten-
tial for bias as new diagnoses occurring after, 
but not during, two large wildfire episodes 
were included (Tse et al. 2015).
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD). Epidemiological evidence of asso-
ciations between wildfire smoke exposure and 
exacerbation of COPD is mounting. Elevated 
rates of hospitalizations (Delfino et al. 2009; 
Johnston et al. 2007; Martin et al. 2013; 
Morgan et al. 2010; Mott et al. 2005), ED 
visits (Duclos et al. 1990; Johnston et al. 
2014; Rappold et al. 2011), and physician 
visits for COPD (Yao et al. 2016) have been 
associated with wildfire smoke exposure. 
Additionally, the findings of increased reliever 
medication dispensing during wildfire smoke 
exposure in British Columbia may indicate 
increases in COPD or asthma exacerbations 
(Elliott et al. 2013; Yao et al. 2016).
Respiratory infections. The evidence for 
associations between wildfire smoke exposure 
and respiratory infections is inconsistent. 
Duclos et al. (1990) found a higher rate of 
ED visits for respiratory infections during 
major wildfires in California compared to 
a reference period. Rappold et al. (2011) 
found a suggestive increase in ED visits 
for upper respiratory infections in smoke-
affected counties in North Carolina during 
peat fires compared to a reference period 
and this temporal increase was not found 
in non-smoke-affected counties. Henderson 
et al. (2011) and Yao et al. (2016), however, 
found no association between wildfire smoke 
exposure and physician visits for upper 
respiratory infections in British Columbia. 
Johnston et al. (2007) reported no association 
between PM predominantly from wildfires 
and hospitalizations for respiratory infections 
in Australia.
The evidence does suggest an association 
between wildfire smoke and acute bron-
chitis and pneumonia, however. Although 
Johnston et al. (2014) did not find an asso-
ciation between ED visits for pneumonia and 
bronchitis associated with wildfire smoke in 
Australia, most other studies did. Yao et al. 
(2016) found significant increases in physi-
cian visits for lower respiratory infections 
associated with PM2.5 over 10 fire seasons 
in British Columbia. Rappold et al. (2011) 
documented increased ED visits for pneu-
monia and acute bronchitis associated with 
exposure to smoke from a peat fire. Duclos 
et al. (1990) found higher rates of hospitaliza-
tion for bronchitis during a wildfire compared 
to a reference period. Moreover, Martin et al. 
(2013) reported associations between days 
with high levels of bushfire smoke and hospi-
talizations for pneumonia and acute bron-
chitis in Newcastle, Australia, although this 
association was not found in the larger city 
of Sydney; the authors attribute this to lack 
of precision in estimates of specific respira-
tory outcomes. Two studies have documented 
similar associations between wildfire smoke 
and background PM with bronchitis and 
pneumonia (Delfino et al. 2009; Morgan 
et al. 2010), suggesting that effects of wildfire 
and urban PM on these outcomes are similar.
Cardiovascular Morbidity
Results from studies of associations between 
cardiovascular outcomes and wildfire smoke 
exposure are inconsistent. Many studies of 
wildfire smoke exposure have found no asso-
ciations with grouped cardiovascular disease 
outcomes (Hanigan et al. 2008; Henderson 
et al. 2011; Johnston et al. 2007, 2014; 
Lee et al. 2009; Martin et al. 2013; Moore 
et al. 2006; Morgan et al. 2010; Rappold 
et al. 2011; Yao et al. 2016), although a 
few have documented evidence for specific 
end points. Rates of out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrests were associated with wildfire-related 
PM2.5 in Australia (Dennekamp et al. 2015; 
Haikerwal et al. 2015). Hospitalizations but 
not ED visits for acute myocardial infarctions 
(MI) were associated with wildfire-related 
PM2.5 during the same fires (Haikerwal

et al. 2015). ED visits for congestive heart 
failure (CHF) were associated with wildfire 
smoke exposure from a peat fire in North 
Carolina (Rappold et al. 2011), but only a 
suggestive association was found for CHF 
hospitalizations and PM2.5 during a wildfire 
in southern California (Delfino et al. 2009). 
Johnston et  al. (2014) did not find any 
association between wildfire smoke and ED 
cardiac failure. Other studies have found no 
associations between wildfire smoke exposure 
and CHF (Martin et al. 2013; Morgan et al. 
2010) or cardiac dysrhythmias (Delfino et al. 
2009; Johnston et al. 2014; Martin et al. 
2013). And no associations were found in the 
one study that investigated angina in relation 
to wildfire PM2.5 (Haikerwal et al. 2015).
Study results are also mixed for ischemic 
heart disease (IHD). Higher counts of hospital-
izations for IHD than expected based on histor-
ical data were found in Sarawak, Malaysia, 
during the prolonged very high PM levels 
of the 1997 Southeast Asian wildfires (Mott 
et al. 2005). ED visits for IHD were higher 
on smoke-affected days in Sydney, Australia 
(Johnston et al. 2014), but two other studies 
in Australia (Martin et al. 2013; Morgan 
et al. 2010) and one in California (Delfino 
et al. 2009) reported no associations for IHD 
hospital admissions. A study in Darwin, 
Australia, found increased risk of IHD hospital-
izations only among the indigenous population, 
whereas the results suggested an inverse asso-
ciation among the whole population (Johnston 
et al. 2007). Researchers also found a positive 
association between PM10 during a wildfire 
and clinic visits for IHD in a Native American 
reservation in California (Lee et al. 2009).
Very few studies have investigated other 
cardiovascular outcomes, making definitive 
conclusions difficult. Arbex et al. (2010) found 
increases in hospitalizations for hypertension 
associated with exposure to total suspended 
particles over 2 years within a community 
seasonally exposed to smoke from burning 
sugarcane, but there was no clear difference in 
this finding between burning and non-burning 
periods, which implies that the relationship 
may not be due to the source of the particles. 
Henderson et al. (2011) did not find any rela-
tionship between PM10 during a wildfire and 
physician visits for hypertension. One (Delfino 
et al. 2009) of three (Delfino et al. 2009; 
Morgan et al. 2010; Johnston et al. 2014) 
studies to investigate cerebrovascular disease 
or stroke found a suggestive association with 
wildfire smoke exposure.
Too few studies and too many inconsis-
tencies in findings exist to determine whether 
wildfire smoke exposure is associated with 
specific cardiovascular outcomes, despite 
evidence that exposure to ambient PM is asso-
ciated with increased risk of cardiovascular 
morbidity (Brook et al. 2010).
Birth Outcomes
Corroborative evidence suggests that wildfire 
smoke exposure effects on birth outcomes 
are plausible. For example, a growing litera-
ture exists on associations between adverse 
birth outcomes and exposure to ambient air 
pollution (Woodruff et al. 2010), to wood 
smoke from household cooking and heating 
in developing countries (e.g., Lakshmi et al. 
2013) and to household heating in developed 
countries (Gehring et al. 2014). While these 
exposures are chronic compared to the more 
acute nature of exposure to smoke from some 
wildfires, some studies have demonstrated 
links between wildfire smoke exposure and 
birth outcomes. Holstius et al. (2012) found 
lower birth weights, overall and for the second 
and third trimesters specifically, for babies that 
gestated during the 2003 southern California 
wildfires compared to babies from the same 
region born before or more than 9 months 
after the fires. Jayachandran (2009) found 
that prenatal smoke exposure from the 1997 
Southeast Asian wildfire in the third trimester 
was the most important predictor of ‘missing’ 
children from the Indonesian 2000 Census, 
the only way to estimate early life deaths from 
the scant data in Indonesia. Pregnant women 
exposed to very high levels of PM2.5 from 
agricultural burning in the Brazilian Amazon 
had higher rates of low birthweight babies 
compared to those exposed to lower levels 
(Cândido da Silva et al. 2014).
Mental Health Outcomes
Although many studies have documented 
evidence of psychological impairment related 
to wildfires (e.g. Papanikolaou et al. 2011), few 
have investigated smoke exposure as a cause. 
We found six studies that investigated the asso-
ciation between objective mental health impacts 
and wildfire smoke exposure; however, four 
of those were deemed to have higher poten-
tial for bias (Ho et al. 2014; McDermott et al. 
2005; Marshall et al. 2007; Caamano-Isorna 
et al. 2011). In the two studies that remain, one 
found no increase in physician visits for mental 
illness associated with PM during the 2003 
wildfire season in British Columbia (Moore 
et al. 2006) and the other found no increase in 
mental health hospitalizations during the 1987 
California fires compared to a reference period 
(Duclos et al. 1990).
Toxicological Studies
A major pathway by which PM causes respi-
ratory effects is through pulmonary oxidative 
stress and inflammation (Nakayama Wong 
et al. 2011). Systemic responses are the main 
pathways through which PM is thought to 
influence cardiovascular health. These are 
hypothesized to be induced either directly 
by the movement of pro-inflammatory, pro-
coagulation, and pro-oxidant components of 
PM to the circulation, indirectly as a conse-
quence of the pulmonary changes induced by 
PM, or through PM-mediated changes in the 
autonomic nervous system (Brook et al. 2010; 
Delfino et al. 2010).
In vivo animal studies of wildfire-derived 
PM exposure compared to controls have 
demonstrated increased oxidative stress and 
cell death in mice (Williams et al. 2013), and 
lower counts of lung macrophages, higher 
levels of inflammatory cells and cytokines, 
and greater antioxidant depletion in a study 
of smoke from a California wildfire in a 
mouse model (Wegesser et al. 2009, 2010).
Similarly, increased respiratory inflammation 
and reduced lung mechanics compared with 
controls was documented from a mouse study 
of biomass smoke from burning sugarcane in 
Brazil (Mazzoli-Rocha et al. 2008). In vivo 
studies in humans have also demonstrated 
increased inflammatory responses, specifically 
elevated band neutrophil counts in peripheral 
blood (Tan et al. 2000) and elevated cyto-
kines (van Eeden et al. 2001) associated with 
air pollution levels during the 1997 Southeast 
Asian wildfires.
In vitro studies have documented increased 
inflammation in rat alveolar macrophages 
exposed to PM2.5 from prescribed fires (Myatt 
et al. 2011) and in human bronchial epithe-
lial cells exposed to wildfire-derived PM2.5 
compared to cells exposed to ambient PM 
(Nakayama Wong et al. 2011). After exposure 
to wildfire-derived PM, human lung epithe-
lial cells showed declines in glutathione, an 
important antioxidant (Pavagadhi et al. 2013); 
mouse peritoneal monocytes showed increased 
hydrogen peroxide production and oxygen 
radical generation (Leonard et al. 2007); and 
mouse macrophages (Franzi et al. 2011), rat 
macrophages (Myatt et al. 2011), and human 
lung epithelial cells (Pavagadhi et al. 2013) 
had increased cell death.
Oxidative stress can also lead to DNA 
damage. All size fractions of PM extracted 
from wildfire smoke caused DNA damage in 
mouse peritoneal monocytes (Leonard et al. 
2007). Studies in regions near sugarcane 
burning in the Brazilian Amazon observed 
higher numbers of micronucleated cells, 
a measure of genotoxicity, in buccal cells 
from children in highly smoke-affected areas 
compared to children in a control community 
(Sisenando et al. 2012); however, it is unclear 
if the higher pollution in the study commu-
nities was solely due to agricultural burning 
because two factories are located in the exposed 
but not in the control region. Another study 
found more micronucleated buccal cells in 
sugarcane workers compared to nearby hospital 
administrative workers (Silveira et al. 2013), 
but the authors do not mention any control for 
other differences in these two populations that 
could explain this finding.Reid et al.

volume 124 | number 9 | September 2016  •  Environmental Health Perspectives
A recent study demonstrated the potential 
for early life exposure to wildfire smoke to 
confer immune effects, measured as reduced 
cytokine synthesis in peripheral blood cells, 
lasting into adolescence in Rhesus macaque 
monkeys (Miller et al. 2013). Short-term 
inhalation of wood smoke in general and not 
specifically from a wildfire can compromise 
lung immune responses, which may be one 
reason for the observed increased likelihood of 
lung infections in children exposed to wood 
smoke (Zelikoff et al. 2002). There is there-
fore growing evidence to support the theory 
that incidence of respiratory infections can be 
increased by exposure to wildfire smoke.
In summary, existing toxicological 
evidence supports potential respiratory and 
cardiovascular health effects of wildfire smoke 
exposure. The body of evidence, however, 
is relatively small compared to toxicological 
studies of general PM.
Vulnerable Populations
Few epidemiological studies have investi-
gated whether specific populations are more 
susceptible to wildfire smoke exposure than 
the general population. Susceptibility factors 
investigated include those related to lifestage, 
pre-existing disease, socioeconomic status 
(SES), and ethnicity. Unless otherwise stated, 
all subgroup differences are based on observed 
changes in the magnitudes of point estimates, 
not on significance tests.
The findings for differential effects by age 
are inconclusive. A study of PM10 exposure 
in Malaysia from the 1997 Southeast Asian 
wildfires found higher rates of mortality 
among people 65–74 years old compared to 
others; a smaller suggestive effect was found 
among those ≥ 75 years old (Sastry 2002). 
People ≥ 65 years old had higher rates of 
respiratory hospitalizations compared to 
younger adults exposed to biomass burning 
in the Brazilian Amazon (Ignotti et al. 2010) 
and wildfire smoke in Australia (Morgan et al. 
2010). Such older adults were also found to 
have higher rates of hospitalization for asthma 
than their younger counterparts during 
California wildfires (Delfino et al. 2009), and 
higher rates of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests 
and hospitalizations for IHD in Victoria, 
Australia (Haikerwal et al. 2015).
Other studies, however, have found higher 
effects for younger adults than for older adults. 
Wildfire PM-related respiratory admissions 
during Indonesian wildfires exceeded predic-
tions for 40- to 64-year-olds but not for those 
≥ 65 years (Mott et al. 2005). Similarly, ED 
visits for COPD, and pneumonia and acute 
bronchitis were more strongly associated with 
peat fire smoke among people < 65 years old 
compared to people ≥ 65 in North Carolina 
(Rappold et al. 2011). Although respiratory 
physician visits were associated with PM10 
among people 60–70 years old and among 
those ≥ 80 in a British Columbia wildfire, 
younger adults exhibited stronger associa-
tions (Henderson et al. 2011). No differences 
were found in either of the two studies that 
investigated differential effects by age for 
cardiovascular outcomes (Morgan et al. 2010, 
Henderson et al. 2011).
Children with asthma did not experience 
increased respiratory symptoms or medica-
tion use during Australian wildfires, whereas 
adults did (Johnston et al. 2006). Similarly, 
the highest PM-related increase in physician 
visits for asthma during a wildfire in British 
Columbia was found for adults (Henderson 
et al. 2011), as was true for ED visits for 
asthma on smoke-affected days in Australia 
(Johnston et al. 2014). Asthma hospitaliza-
tions among children ages 0–5 years were 
more strongly associated with wildfire PM2.5 
exposure than were asthma hospitalizations for 
both older children and adults < 65 years old 
during a California wildfire; but the greatest 
association was found for people ≥ 65 years 
(Delfino et al. 2009).
Some studies have used previous health 
care utilization as a measure of pre-existing 
health conditions. One study found no effect 
modification by number of physician visits in 
the previous year (Henderson et al. 2011). In 
contrast, people ≥ 65 years old who were hospi-
talized for any cardiorespiratory outcome in the 
first half of the year were at increased risk of 
being hospitalized during the 1997 Southeast 
Asian fires compared with similar temporal 
comparisons in previous years without fires 
(Mott et al. 2005). Pre-existing cardiac or respi-
ratory conditions may plausibly increase vulner-
ability to wildfire smoke exposure; however, the 
available evidence is currently inconclusive.
A recent study found that body mass 
index modified the association of wildfire 
smoke exposure on exacerbations of asthma, as 
measured by prevalence of physician-dispensed 
short-acting beta-agonists for children with 
asthma in southern California (Tse et al. 2015).
Few studies have investigated how socio-
economic status (SES) influences responses 
to wildfire smoke exposure. Henderson et al. 
(2011) noted findings of no effect modifica-
tion by neighborhood SES on associations 
between wildfire smoke exposure and physi-
cian visits in British Columbia, Canada, 
but detailed results were not presented. In 
contrast, during a North Carolina peat fire, 
North Carolina counties with lower SES 
had higher rates of ED visits for asthma and 
CHF compared to counties with higher SES 
(Rappold et al. 2012). Similarly, in Indonesia, 
districts with lower food consumption demon-
strated larger adverse associations between 
smoke exposure and survival of birth cohorts 
than those with higher household food 
consumption (Jayachandran 2009).
To our knowledge only one ethnic 
subgroup has been studied in relation to differ-
ential health outcomes associated with wildfire 
smoke exposure. Indigenous people in Australia 
experienced higher rates of hospitalization for 
respiratory infections (Hanigan et al. 2008), 
and IHD (Johnston et al. 2007) associated 
with exposure to bushfire smoke than non-
indigenous people. This effect may be explained 
by underlying health status, access to medical 
services, or other social characteristics in this 
group (Martin et al. 2013).
Discussion
Our critical review demonstrated consistent 
evidence of associations between wildfire 
smoke exposure with general respiratory 
morbidity and with exacerbations of asthma 
and COPD (Table 1). Mounting epidemiolog-
ical evidence and plausible toxicological mech-
anisms suggest an association between wildfire 
smoke exposure and respiratory infections, but 
inconsistencies remain. Increasing evidence 
suggests an association between wildfire smoke 
exposure and all-cause mortality, especially 
from more recent, higher-powered studies 
(e.g., Johnston et al. 2011; Morgan et al. 2010; 
Faustini et al. 2015). The current evidence 
for cardiovascular morbidity from wildfire 
smoke exposure remains mixed; many studies 
are inconclusive or negative, but some have 
demonstrated significant increases for specific 
cardiovascular outcomes, such as cardiac 
arrests. Toxicological findings are consis-
tent with cardiac effects through evidence of 
systemic inflammation and increased coagula-
bility. Most of the other end points of interest, 
including birth outcomes, mental health, and 
cancer have not been sufficiently studied.
Our review highlights the lack of informa-
tion about which populations are most suscep-
tible to wildfire smoke exposure. People already 
diagnosed with asthma or COPD are more 
susceptible. We found inconsistent evidence of 
differential effects by age or SES. Two studies 
have suggested differential effects by Australian 
indigenous status with no investigation of other 
ethnic groups.
Many gaps exist in understanding the 
public health implications of exposure to 
wildfire smoke. Larger studies with greater 
statistical power and more spatially refined 
exposure assessments are needed to better char-
acterize impacts on mortality, cardiovascular 
disease, birth outcomes, and mental health 
effects. Currently, evidence exists of exacerba-
tion, but not incidence, of asthma and COPD 
from wildfire smoke exposure. In temperate 
parts of the world, where wildfire smoke 
exposure is episodic, it is unlikely that changes 
in asthma incidence would be observed. Studies 
have not been conducted in populations

with wildfire smoke exposure have not yet been 
sufficiently studied, such as otitis media, which 
has been associated with exposure to second-
hand tobacco smoke (Kong and Coates 2009), 
air pollution from woodsmoke (MacIntyre 
et al. 2011) and recently wildfire smoke (Yao 
et al. 2016). Human experimental studies of 
exposures to wildfire smoke could help clarify 
biological mechanisms. Very little information 
exists on health effects associated with measures 
of pollutants in wildfire smoke other than PM, 
such as ozone or PAHs. Although this review 
combined results from studies of various types 
of fires, it is possible that smoke originating 
from peat fires, forest fires, grassland fires, and 
agricultural burning could lead to differential 
health effects due to different constituents in 
the smoke. To our knowledge, no studies have 
yet investigated chronic exposure to wildfire 
smoke, but many populations in Southeast 
Asia, Africa, and Latin America are exposed 
regularly for extended periods (Johnston 
et al. 2012).
Characterization of the exposure–response 
function is critical for setting smoke levels 
for public health warnings or interventions, 
and it is not yet known whether current levels 
based on undifferentiated PM sufficiently 
characterize the effects of wildfire smoke. 
Four studies (Arbex et al. 2010; Chen et al. 
2006; Johnston et al. 2002; Sastry 2002) 
have attempted to identify effects at different 
exposure levels, but these studies are hard to 
compare because of differences in exposure 
assessment methods, health outcomes, types of 
fires, and population susceptibilities.
Conclusions
We found consistent evidence of associations 
between wildfire smoke exposure and respi-
ratory morbidity in general, and specifically 
for exacerbations of asthma and COPD. 
Growing evidence suggests associations with 
respiratory infections and all-cause mortality. 
More research is needed to determine whether 
wildfire smoke exposure is consistently associ-
ated with cardiovascular effects, specific causes 
of mortality, birth outcomes, and mental health 
outcomes. Research into which populations are 
most susceptible to health effects from wildfire 
smoke exposure is also needed to inform public 
health planning for future wildfires.

(WHO) 1998]. Most biomass burning is car-
ried out in developing countries and is done
to clear land for shifting cultivation, to con-
vert forests to agricultural or pastoral lands,
and to remove dry vegetation to promote agri-
cultural productivity. Burning of agricultural
wastes in the field, such as sugar cane and
stalks from grain crops, is another important
type of biomass burning (Artaxo et al. 1999;
Crutzen and Andreae 1990). 
Biomass burning emissions represent an
important global source of particles and
gases to the atmosphere, especially in the
tropics where biomass burning is widespread.
Annually, 7,500–8,600 Tg (teragrams) of dry
material is emitted to the atmosphere around
the world through the process of burning.
About 43% of this dry material is derived
from savannah burning, 23% from the burn-
ing of agricultural waste, 18% from rainforest
burning, and 16% from wood burning for
fuel (Levine et al. 1995). Biomass burning
emits large amounts of carbon and particulate
matter (PM). Estimates show that the annual
carbon and PM released to the atmosphere
because of biomass fires in the tropics is
around 2,000–4,500 Tg and 36–154 Tg,
respectively (Crutzen and Andreae 1990).
Brazil plays an important role in biomass
burning emissions. Most of the ﬁres in Brazil
occur during the dry season, from May
through October. An especially critical area in
the country is the Amazon region, where every
year approximately 17,000 km2 of tropical
forests are cut down and most of them burned.
Until now, of the total Amazon area (5.5 mil-
lion km2), 14% has been deforested (Instituto
Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais 2002).
In São Paulo State, located in the south-
eastern region of Brazil, most of the ﬁres are
generated in agricultural fields, especially
sugar cane crops, in which 20 tons/ha are
burned every year to facilitate harvesting.
Sugar cane fires also have significant effects
on the composition and acidity of rainwater
over large areas of southeastern Brazil because
of the emissions of aerosol and trace gases
(Lara et al. 2001). Aerosols can also cause
injury to human health. Small PM, particu-
larly those < 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter
(PM2.5), appear to have the greatest potential
for damaging health because they can pene-
trate deep into the lungs and reach the lower
respiratory system (American Thoracic
Society 1996). Despite its importance, little
information about the aerosol particles emit-
ted from sugar cane burning is available (Lara
et al. 2005; Martinelli et al. 2002).
Within this scenario, the Piracicaba
region, located in São Paulo State, is especially
interesting because the atmosphere of this
region receives emissions not only from indus-
trial and urban sources but also and primarily
from sugar cane burning (Lara et al. 2001). In
this study, we investigated the influences of
PM generated from sugar cane burning on
respiratory hospital admissions of children and
the elderly.
Materials and Methods
Study area and sampling. The city of
Piracicaba is located in the western part of
the Piracicaba River basin, in São Paulo
State, and has a population of approximately
320,000 inhabitants and a population density
of 242 inhabitants/km2 (Figure 1). The land
use in this area is dominated by sugar cane
plantations (80%), followed by pastures
(11%), urban areas (6%), and forests (3%)
(Centro de Energia Nuclear para a Agronomia
1997). Sugar cane is burned every year from
May through October, during the dry season,

We analyzed the inﬂuence of emissions from burning sugar cane on the respiratory system during
almost 1 year in the city of Piracicaba in southeast Brazil. From April 1997 through March 1998,
samples of inhalable particles were collected, separated into ﬁne and coarse particulate mode, and
analyzed for black carbon and tracer elements. At the same time, we examined daily records of
children (< 13 years of age) and elderly people (> 64 years of age) admitted to the hospital because
of respiratory diseases. Generalized linear models were adopted with natural cubic splines to con-
trol for season and linear terms to control for weather. Analyses were carried out for the entire
period, as well as for burning and nonburning periods. Additional models were built using three
factors obtained from factor analysis instead of particles or tracer elements. Increases of
10.2 µg/m3 in particles ≤2.5 µm/m3 aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and 42.9 µg/m3 in PM10
were associated with increases of 21.4% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.3–38.5] and 31.03%
(95% CI, 1.25–60.21) in child and elderly respiratory hospital admissions, respectively. When we
compared periods, the effects during the burning period were much higher than the effects during
nonburning period. Elements generated from sugar cane burning (factor 1) were those most asso-
ciated with both child and elderly respiratory admissions. Our results show the adverse impact of
sugar cane burning emissions on the health of the population, reinforcing the need for public
efforts to reduce and eventually eliminate this source of air pollution. Key words: air pollution,

http://dx.doi.org/ [Online 13 January 2006]whereas the wet season extends from November
through April.
From April 1997 through March 1998,
samples of inhalable particles (PM10) were
taken from four stacked ﬁlter units (SFU) in
two separated size fractions: ﬁne PM (PM2.5)
and coarse PM (2.5 < particle diameter < 10
µm). Each filter unit was a 47-mm diameter
Nuclepore polycarbonate filter (Whatman
International Ltd., Kent, UK) and was
retrieved every 72 hr. Samplings were obtained
at the meteorologic station of the Escola
Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz,
which is located about 4 km from downtown
Piracicaba and < 1 km from the nearest sugar
cane plantation. The SFU inlets were located
3 m above the ground to minimize direct
inﬂuences of local resuspended soil dust. The
dominant wind direction was from the sugar
cane plantations to the sampling station.
Gravimetric mass and black carbon (BC) were
measured in the Nuclepore filters. BC was
measured by a reﬂectance technique according
to the method developed by Reid et al. (1998).
Elemental composition was measured by
particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE)
(Johansson and Campbell 1998), a multi-
elemental technique that allows the identiﬁca-
tion of 21 elements (aluminum, silicon,
phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, potassium, cal-
cium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, man-
ganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, selenium,
bromine, rubidium, strontium, zirconium,
lead). PIXE detection limits are about 1 ng/m3
for elements with Z > 20 and about 10 ng/m3
for elements from sodium to K. Details on
PIXE technique and aerosol sampling have
been reported by Artaxo et al. (1999) and
Yamasoe et al. (2000).
To investigate the respiratory health effects
on the Piracicaba population, we obtained
daily records of hospital admissions due to res-
piratory diseases [categorized according to
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 9th revi-
sion, (ICD-9; WHO 1975) codes 460–519
and International Classification of Diseases,
10th revision (ICD-10; WHO 1994) codes
J00–J99] for children (< 13 years of age) and
the elderly (> 64 years of age) from the gov-
ernment health agency (DATASUS; Brasilia,
Brazil) from April 1997 to March 1998. The
Agricultural School of São Paulo University
(Piracicaba, Brazil) provided daily records of
minimum temperature and relative humidity.
Statistical analysis of air pollutant health
effects. Counts of daily respiratory hospital
admissions for children and elderly were mod-
eled separately for the entire period in Poisson
regressions. We used the generalized linear
model (McCullagh and Nelder 1989) with
natural cubic splines (Green and Silverman
1994) to control for season. Splines were used
to account for the nonlinear dependence of
the hospital admissions on that covariate.
The function of time was used to remove
the basic seasonal pattern (and long-term trend)
from the data. If each admission were an inde-
pendent event, we would expect no serial corre-
lation in the data. Seasonal patterns for each
end point (child and elderly respiratory hospital
admissions) were modeled. Because we assumed
that seasonal patterns would vary according to
the adopted end point, end point–speciﬁc time
smoothing parameters were used.
It was not necessary to incorporate auto-
regressive terms (Brumback et al. 2000) in the
models because autocorrelation plots showed
there were no remaining serial correlations in
the residual. Indicators for day of the week
were included in order to control for short-
term trends.
Respiratory diseases present an almost lin-
ear relationship with weather. Therefore, lin-
ear terms for temperature and relative
humidity were adopted. To reduce sensitivity
to outliers in the dependent variable, we used
robust regression (M-estimation). Three-day
moving averages of BC, PM, and their main
tracer elements were used to estimate the
effects on respiratory morbidity.
For each age group, using the coefﬁcients
of the pollutants that presented adverse effects
on respiratory hospital admissions for the
entire period, we estimated the effects in two
different periods: burning (May through
October) and nonburning (November
through April).

The communality expressed for each variable represents the fraction of the respective variable that is explained by the
retained factors. In this case, the communalities were typically higher than 82% (PM2.5). This indicated that the factors
could explain most of the data variability.

ArgentinaAdditionally, because of the large number
of elemental components, speciﬁc rotation fac-
tor analysis was performed to identify main
factors that could represent the main sources
of air pollution in Piracicaba (Weiss 1971),
reducing the analysis to a small number of fac-
tors. Factor analysis is a multivariate technique
that allows for the combination of multiple
variables into few factors based on their degree
of correlation, thereby reducing the number of
elements included in the analysis. Using the
varimax rotation technique, we identified
three main factors from the 17 tracer elements
mentioned above: biomass burning and soil
dust (factor 1), industrial emissions (factor 2),
and fuel or automotive emissions (factor 3)
(Table 1). Additional models were built using
the factors instead of tracer elements in single-
and three-factor models. 
Results were expressed in terms of per-
centage increases in respiratory hospital
admissions for interquartile range (IQR)
increases in air pollutant concentrations. To
carry out the statistical analyses, we used
S-Plus (version 4.536; Insightful Corporation,
Seattle, WA, USA). 
Results
At the time of the study, 26% of the
Piracicaba population were children and ado-
lescents < 13 years of age, and 7% were > 64
years of age. There were 673 hospital admis-
sions due to respiratory diseases among chil-
dren and 275 among the elderly. Table 2
shows the daily descriptive analysis of child
and elderly respiratory hospital admissions and
temperature and humidity of the city of
Piracicaba during the study period. The aver-
age number of child respiratory hospital
admissions was more than twice that of the
elderly, although the child population was
almost four times the elderly population. The
weather in Piracicaba is warm (climate charac-
terized as subtropical Cw; humid with dry
winter), and low temperatures are very rare.
Table 3 presents the descriptive analysis of
the PM and its main elements measured dur-
ing the entire period of study and burning
and nonburning periods. Concentrations of
PM10, PM2.5, and BC presented large sea-
sonal variability with higher concentrations
during the burning period compared with the
nonburning period. For the elements gener-
ated mainly by biomass burning and soil dust,
their concentrations increased from 2-fold to
4-fold between nonburning and burning peri-
ods. During the entire period of study, the
PM10 concentration surpassed the standard
limit adopted for this pollutant (50 µg/m3).
Daily variations in PM10 and PM2.5 as
well as in BC, Al, Si, and K, which are prod-
ucts of biomass burning and soil dust (Lara
et al. 2005), were signiﬁcantly associated with
child respiratory hospital admissions even after
controlling for season and weather (Figure 2).
Mn and S, proxies of industrial and automo-
tive emissions, respectively, also presented
effects on respiratory hospital admissions.
Furthermore, we observed associations
between daily variations in PM10, BC, and K
and elderly respiratory hospital admissions for
the entire period (Table 4).
Figure 3 presents the estimated percentage
increases in child respiratory hospital admis-
sions shown by burning and nonburning
periods. We observed that PM2.5, PM10, BC,
and elements from PM2.5 generated from bio-
mass burning and soil dust promoted higher
effects during the burning period than during
the nonburning period. Because the burning
period is also the period with lower humidity
and temperature, which impair air pollution
dispersion, increases were observed in the ele-
ments generated from other sources, and con-
sequently, higher respiratory effects resulted.
Among the elderly during the sugar cane–
burning period (Figure 4), we also observed
significant increases in respiratory hospital
admissions due to increases in PM10, BC, and
K, a proxy of biomass burning. Mn, a proxy
of industrial emissions, presented significant
associations with elderly hospital admissions
during the nonburning period, showing a pat-
tern of susceptibility different from those
observed among children.
Models using factors (factor 1, biomass
burning and soil dust; 2, industrial emissions;
3, automotive emissions) instead of pollutants
and tracer elements were essential in specify-
ing the source with the major impact on res-
piratory diseases among elderly and children.
Factor 1 presented the highest effect on respi-
ratory hospital admissions in both single- and
three-factor models for children (Table 5) and
the elderly (Table 6). 
Discussion
In contrast to large cities, such as São Paulo;
Santiago, Chile; New York, New York;
Baltimore, Maryland; and cities in Pakistan
and China, where the main sources of aerosol
particles are emissions linked to fossil fuel com-
bustion (Artaxo et al. 1999; Castanho and
Artaxo 2001; Conner et al. 2001; Lena et al.
2002; Zhang et al. 2002), the main source of
aerosol in Piracicaba is biomass burning
(Martinelli et al. 2002). In Piracicaba, sugar
cane burning contributed 60% of the fine-
mode aerosol mass. The second major source
was resuspended soil dust, representing 14% of
the PM2.5. Industry and oil combustion each
contributed 12% of the total PM2.5 mass (Lara
et al. 2005). 
Studies have already shown that land use
can influence the atmospheric composition
in the Amazon Basin (Artaxo et al. 1999;
Yamasoe et al. 2000) and in the State of São
Paulo (Lara et al. 2001; Martinelli et al.
2002). Particularly, in the Piracicaba basin,
the main land use is sugar cane plantations,
which cover almost 80% of the total area.
In the present study, increases in PM10
and PM2.5 were strongly associated with res-
piratory hospital admissions. The magnitudes
of those effects were slightly higher than that
found in São Paulo, the largest Brazilian city
(Braga et al. 1999, 2001; Lin et al. 1999).

Burning periodand PM2.5 were assessed for the same end
point, there were no differences between
them. This could be explained by the fact that
we worked with total PM10 measurements
instead of just the coarse-mode fraction.
Hence, it is possible to assume that the effects
observed for PM10 include PM2.5 effects.
However, in a region with at least three
important sources of PM air pollution—bio-
mass burning and industrial and automotive
emissions—it is necessary to identify the air
pollution source responsible for most of the
respiratory hospital admissions. In this con-
text, the association of elemental components
of PM2.5 that are generated mainly from bio-
mass burning and soil dust (BC, Al, Si, and
K) and the results of factor analysis showing
that factor 1 (biomass burning) was the most
associated with respiratory hospital admis-
sions reinforce the role of this source of air
pollution on child and elderly respiratory dis-
eases in this region, despite the contribution
of industrial and automotive emissions.
The use of factor analysis to identify
and apportion ambient concentrations to
sources has been used in the past, and a work-
shop sponsored by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency explored the use of
resolved source contributions in health effects
models (Thurston et al. 2005). For this work-
shop, multiple groups of investigators ana-
lyzed PM composition data sets from two
U.S. cities, and although different factor
analysis methods were used, similar source
proﬁles were extracted from these sets, with a
good agreement among the major resolved
source types. The same investigators also
found similar health effects associations
(Hopke et al. 2005; Ito et al. 2005; Laden
et al. 2000; Mar et al. 2005). In our data set,
we had 1 year of daily data, which is less than
that in the studies described above; the factor
analysis chose only some factors, and in the
model we adjusted for all potential con-
founders that have been shown to be the most
relevant. The associations of health effects
with the metals are still under investigation,
and although some associations might be due
to chance, evidence for them has been found
in the past. We believe that our results are not
due to chance, even though other studies are
needed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings. 
Studies have shown that population expo-
sure to high levels of pollutants can increase
the risk of acute respiratory infections, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung can-
cer (Smith et al. 1999). Children are the most
susceptible group. Studies performed in the
city of São Paulo have shown adverse effects of
PM on inflammatory and infectious diseases
of both upper and lower respiratory tracts
(Farhat et al. 2005; Lin et al. 1999). Indeed,
acute lower respiratory infections are the single
most important cause of mortality in children
> 5 years of age (Bruce et al. 2000). Globally,
about 43% of the total burden of disease due
to environmental risks falls on children
> 5 years of age, although they make up only
12% of the population (Smith et al. 1999).
This study adopted total respiratory hospi-
tal admissions of children and elderly instead
of speciﬁc-respiratory disease diagnoses because
of the small number of events observed in the
city during the study period. Moreover, this
approach avoided misclassiﬁcation of disease-
speciﬁc diagnoses.
Around Piracicaba, the percentage
increase in child respiratory hospital admis-
sions in relation to the mean levels of PM10,
PM2.5, BC, Al, Si, Mn, K, and S was two to
three times higher in the burning season than
in the nonburning season, compromising the
health of this population. Among the elderly,
the same pattern of effects was observed
between burning and nonburning periods. It
undoubtedly shows that the months of the
year when sugar cane is burned are the most
dangerous for the inhabitants of the region.
In fact, the association between exposure
to indoor and outdoor biomass smoke and
health effects has already been reported in
some areas of Asia and India (Behera et al.
1994; Phonboon et al. 1999). Deposition of
carbon in the lungs occurred consistently in
patients exposed to biomass burning (Bruce
et al. 2000). However, different from most of
the mentioned regions where outdoor biomass
burning events are episodic, biomass burning is
a common and scheduled activity in Piracicaba
and other Brazilian sugar cane plantation areas,
exposing the population on a regular basis. 
The mechanisms whereby PM causes air-
way diseases have been studied. Oxidative
stress, caused by the release of oxidant radicals
by inflammatory cells, may be an important
component in promoting inflammation and
respiratory cell damage, compromising pul-
monary function, increasing susceptibilities to
allergens, and increasing the incidence of respi-
ratory infections (Bernstein et al. 2004; Bruce
et al. 2000).
The population of these areas of Brazil has
been exposed to sugar cane burning for at
least 6 months every year for the last four
decades. The health effect is determined not
just by acute exposures to high pollution lev-
els but also, and more importantly, by the
length of time that people spend breathing
polluted air chronically. Similar to this study,
the acute effect of sugar-cane–generated air
pollution was assessed previously in São Paulo
State (Arbex et al. 2000). However, the mag-
nitude of chronic effects is not known.
Alcohol produced from sugar cane is a
renewable fuel and is less pollutant than fossil
fuel. Brazil is the largest producer of sugar and
alcohol from sugar cane in the world.
Plantations cover about 5 million hectares and
surround a great number of cities, mainly in
the southeastern region of the country. About
80% of the sugar cane crops are burned to
facilitate harvesting every year (Brazilian
Agriculture Ministry 2005).
The addition of alcohol to gasoline and
national policies to reduce automotive emis-
sions contributed to a decrease in air pollution
in Brazilian urban centers in the last 20 years.
Nowadays, the use of alcohol as automotive
fuel is under study or has already been par-
tially adopted in many countries. Hence, it is
clear that ethanol production will tend to
grow in this century. To avoid secondary
health damages, the procedure of burning the
crops before harvesting should be banished.
In summary, we showed that air pollution
from biomass burning causes damage to the
respiratory system, leading to an increase in
respiratory hospital admissions. This effect is
higher for children and the elderly, and it is
similar to that observed in urban areas due to
exposure to industrial and vehicle-emitted air
pollutants. Finally, it is necessary to keep in
mind the close relation between health effects
and air pollution. This concern should be
included in public efforts for sustainability and
improving environmental health conditions.

"1.  Introduction
In Africa, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) caused 1.1 million premature deaths, when considering ambient and 
household air pollution (361,000 of the deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5) in 2019 (Fisher et al., 2021; Murray 
et al., 2020) making it the leading environmental risk factor for premature death, ahead of unsafe water, unsafe 
sanitation, and handwashing. PM2.5 leads to health impacts because particles can travel far beyond the head 
airways and deposit deep in the tracheobronchial or alveolar region of the respiratory system, depending on the 
diameter of the particle (Hussein et al., 2013; Kodros et al., 2018; Londahl et al., 2009). Long-term exposure 
to PM2.5 has been linked to heart failure, pneumonia, Parkinson's disease, urinary tract infections, dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease, increased risk for psychiatric disorders, depression, anxiety, increased brain inflammation, 
reduced fertility and miscarriages, Ischemic heart disease (IHD), lung cancer (LC), stoke, and chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. (Allen et al., 2016; Braithwaite et al., 2019; Elliott et al., 2013; Grande 
et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2011; Holstius et al., 2012; Ilango & Shaffer, 2020; Johnston et al., 2012; Naeher 
et al., 2007; Peeples, 2020; Stefanidou et al., 2008; Veras et al., 2010). Many people across Africa currently live 
in regions that exceed the World Health Organization's (WHO) newly revised PM2.5 guideline of annual average 
Abstract  Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the second leading risk factor 
of premature death in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use GEOS-Chem to quantify the effects of (a) trash burning, 
(b) residential solid-fuel burning, and (c) open biomass burning (BB) (i.e., landscape fires) on ambient PM2.5 
and PM2.5-attributable mortality in Africa. Using a series of sensitivity simulations, we excluded each of the 
three combustion sources in each of five African regions. We estimate that in 2017 emissions from these three 
combustion sources within Africa increased global ambient PM2.5 by 2%, leading to 203,000 (95% confidence 
interval: 133,000–259,000) premature mortalities yr −1 globally and 167,000 premature mortalities yr −1 in 
Africa. BB contributes more ambient PM2.5-related premature mortalities per year (63%) than residential 
solid-fuel burning (29%) and trash burning (8%). Open BB in Central Africa leads to the largest number of 
PM2.5-attributed mortalities inside the region, while trash burning in North Africa and residential solid-fuel 
burning in West Africa contribute the most regional mortalities for each source. Overall, Africa has a unique 
ambient air pollution profile because natural sources, such as windblown dust and BB, contribute strongly 
to ambient PM2.5 levels and PM2.5-related mortality. Air pollution policies may need to focus on taking 
preventative measures to avoid exposure to ambient PM2.5 from these less-controllable sources.
Plain Language Summary  Air pollution substantially impacts human health in Africa and may 
continue to get worse in the coming years with population and economic growth and urbanization. In this 
modeling study, we estimate the health benefits from removing three combustion sources (trash burning, 
residential biofuel used for home cooking and heating, and open biomass burning) and the regional differences 
across Africa. Our finding suggests that eliminating these sources in Africa can prevent 167,000 premature 
mortalities each year in the continent alone and 203,000 deaths globally. The information we provide may help 
policy makers in developing appropriate policies to mitigate the impacts of air pollution in Africa.

concentration of 5 μg m −3 (Ayetor et al., 2021; WHO, 2021a, 2021b). Additionally, Africa is experiencing rapid 
urbanization, population growth, and a growing economy, and it is projected to grow to 40% of the world's 
population by 2100 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, & Population Division, 2017). 
Africa is projected to have the fastest urban growth rate in the world: by 2050, Africa's cities will be home to 
an additional 950 million people, and the continent's population is anticipated to be primarily urban by 2035 
(OECD/SWAC, 2020). Thus, air pollution is likely to increase and impact more people across the continent in the 
future (Abera et al., 2021; Coker & Kizito, 2018).
The PM2.5 in Africa likely has different physical properties (e.g., size, composition) than PM2.5 in many other 
parts of the world. Compared to other regions of the world, such as North America and Europe, there are rela-
tively few studies on the sources, composition, and health impacts of PM2.5 in Africa (Abera et al., 2021; Katoto 
et al., 2019; Liousse et al., 2014). Important sources of PM2.5 in Africa include waste burning, residential solid-
fuel burning for cooking and heating, and open biomass burning (BB) (Amegah & Agyei-Mensah, 2017; Bearak 
et al., 2021; Mead et al., 2008; Naidja et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2016). We selected these three 
combustion sources because they are more diffuse and inefficient than sources that have been studied in North 
America and Europe (e.g., traffic, industry, power generation). While there are other large sources of PM2.5 on 
the African continent, such as natural dust (Kotsyfakis et al., 2019; Urrutia-Pereira et al., 2021), here, we focus 
on three diffuse combustion sources because they are less controlled across Africa in comparison to other regions 
of the world, are understudied and unique from fossil-fuel sources that have been studied more historically, and 
they may have increased emissions in the future with population growth and climate change.
Although some countries have regulations in place that prohibit open trash burning, waste burning is common 
across Africa due the lack of solid waste collection services, the inability to fund collection programs, and poor 
waste management (Godfrey et al., 2019; Solomon, 2011). Residents in Africa generate low quantities of waste 
when compared to other regions of the world, however, only approximately 44% of waste is collected and the 
future growth rates of waste generation are likely to be large (Godfrey et al., 2019). Sub-Saharan Africa generates 
less than 0.6 kg per capita per day as opposed to an average of 2.2 kg per capita per day in developed countries 
(Hoornweg & Bhada-Tata, 2012). When residents burn waste, toxic gaseous and PM2.5 are emitted (Christian 
et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014), leading to degradation of regional air 
quality.
More than 60% of people who live in Africa still depend on residential combustion of solid fuels such as wood, 
coal, dung, crop waste, and charcoal for household heating and cooking (Bonjour et al., 2013; Eberhard et al., 2008; 
Girard, 2002; World Health Organization. Regional Office for South-East Asia, 2006). When combusted, resi-
dential solid fuels emit high levels PM2.5 with a large fraction composed of black carbon and organic matter. Air 
pollution from residential solid fuels impacts indoor air quality as well as outdoor air quality in regions of heavy 
use. Because of the large electricity deficit in Africa (IEA, 2021) residential solid-fuel use is widespread, thus 
negatively impacting air quality and public health across the region. Population growth in Africa is projected to 
outpace future electricity access gains (IEA, 2021). According to recent studies, there has been a slow decrease in 
the use of residential solid fuel for cooking in Africa but few programs have been created to switch to clean fuels 
for cooking (Stoner et al., 2021).
Across Africa, open BB (i.e., landscape burning) is the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles and 
the second largest source of trace gasses (Aghedo et al., 2007; Andreae & Merlet, 2001; Bond et al., 2004; Giglio 
et al., 2013). Open BB refers to wildfires, prescribed burning, and agricultural fires, and it encompasses a range 
of fuel types (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands). Africa is the largest source of global BB total carbon emissions, 
contributing ∼52% of global BB emissions (Roberts et al., 2009; van der Werf et al., 2003, 2006, 2010). Open 
BB occurs between November and February in the Northern Hemisphere of Africa (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, 
Nigeria, Niger, Cameron, Sudan, Uganda) and June until October in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Congo, 
Angola, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi) (Roberts et al., 2009). 
These emissions have a substantial impact on human health and air quality locally and downwind (Li et al., 2021)
Here, we use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to quantify the effects of three combustion 
sources in Africa: (a) trash burning, (b) residential solid-fuel burning, and (c) open BB across the five regions of 
Africa defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD): North, Southern, West, Central, and East Africa (Figure 
S1 in Supporting Information S1). We present an analysis of a range of regional sensitivity simulations to inves-
tigate the impacts of local emissions and regional transport on ambient PM2.5 levels across Africa. We use the

GBD approach with newly updated concentration-response function from R. Burnett et al. (2018) to estimate the 
PM2.5-attributable mortalities from local and transported air pollution for each of the emissions sources in each of 
five African regions. To our knowledge, very few health impact assessments have been conducted in this region 
of the world for the three combustion sources we address here.
2.  Methods
2.1.  GEOS-Chem Model Configuration
We use the global 3-D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem version v12.6.0 (https://doi.org/10.5281/
zenodo.3507501) aerosol-only simulation with offline oxidation fields (Bey et  al.,  2001; Leibensperger 
et al., 2012; R. J. Park et al., 2004). The model is driven by assimilated meteorological data from the Goddard 
Earth Observing System Forward Processing product (GEOS-FP) provided by the NASA Global Model and 
Assimilation Office (GMAO, https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov). Each GEOS-Chem simulation was conducted at a 
horizontal resolution of 2° × 2.5° (∼222 by 277.5 km) with 47 vertical layers for the year of 2017 with a one 
month spin up. The model produced surface level ambient PM2.5 concentrations over the continent of Africa

Equation 1 includes ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NIT), sulfate (SO4), hydrophilic black and organic carbon (BCPI 
and OCPI), hydrophobic black and organic carbon (BCPO and OCPO), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), fine-
mode dust aerosol size bins (DST1 and DST2), and fine-mode sea salt (SALA) to calculate surface level ambient 
PM2.5 at an assumed relative humidity of 35%.
Anthropogenic emissions are based on the Community Emissions Data System GBD-Major Air Pollution 
Sources (CEDSGBD-MAPS) inventory (McDuffie et al., 2020), which is a collection of several inventories and 
includes trash (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014) and residential solid-fuel burning emissions to ambient air in Africa 
(Marais & Wiedinmyer, 2016). There are four open BB emissions inventories available over Africa for use with 
GEOS-Chem: The Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) (Giglio et al., 2013), Fire INventory from NCAR 
(FINN) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2011), Quick Fire Emissions Data set (QFED) (Koster et al., 2015), and the Global 
Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) (Kaiser et al., 2012). (See Text S1 in Supporting Information S1) We conducted 
simulations using each of the four BB emissions inventories to evaluate the impacts of inventory choice on 
surface level ambient PM2.5 estimates over Africa. We used the Mineral Dust Entrainment and Deposition model 
(Zeng et al., 2019) to account for emissions of mineral dust. Sea salt emissions followed (Jaegle et al., 2011).
The 28 simulations presented in this study are summarized in Table 1. The first four simulations were base-case 
simulations that varied the open BB emissions inventory. To evaluate the performance of each open BB inven-
tory, we compared the first four simulations to annually averaged PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) 
by conducting a linear least squares regression (Figure 1 and Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). (See 
Section 2.3 for additional details.) The All_on_QFED simulation better reproduced annually-averaged surface 
level ambient PM2.5 estimates than the simulations that used the other BB emission inventories: thus, we used the 
QFED inventory for the remaining 24 simulations.
The remaining simulations were sensitivity simulations that were used to evaluate the impacts of each of the three 
combustion sources (i.e., trash burning, residential solid-fuel burning, and open BB) by region. By comparing 
each sensitivity simulation with the base case, we isolated the influence of regional emissions and atmospheric 
transport on ambient PM2.5 levels across the continent. We conducted six sensitivity simulations for each of 
the three combustion sources, five simulations where the source was turned off in each of the five African 
regions and one simulation where the source was turned off across the whole African continent. Additionally, we 
conducted a set of six simulations where we turned off all three of the combustion sources together in each of the 
five African regions and across the whole African continent.

sions and atmospheric transport across the continent using the GBD approach. To calculate PM2.5-attributableGeoHealth

mortalities, we used baseline 2017 mortality data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (http://
ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) for five causes of premature mortalities: stroke, LC, IHD, COPD, and 
lower respiratory infections (LRI). Additionally, we used gridded population for 2015 from the NASA Socioec-
onomic Data and Application Center (SEDAC, N. E., 2022). We regridded our model resolution of 2° × 2.5° to 
the population data resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°.
The Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) concentration response function (CRF) was used to relate ambi-
ent PM2.5 exposures to the risk of mortality (R. Burnett et al., 2018) for premature mortalities across all age 
groups. The GEMM was formulated by 41 cohort epidemiological studies in 16 countries (but not including 
any African countries) for adults that are older than 25 years old and assumes all PM2.5 components have equal 
toxicity. We selected this CRF, because it is based on a larger data set with wider geographical coverage and

included a wider range of ambient air pollution exposure levels compared to previous CRF meta analyses. Using 
the GEMM coefficients we report mean premature mortalities including their uncertainty range of ±2 × standard 
error. Further, we acknowledge that our choice of GEMM CRF, which does not include health studies in Africa 
(R. Burnett et al., 2018), assumes equal toxicity for all PM2.5 components (M. Park et al., 2018), and is applied to 
all age groups, will contribute to uncertainty in our mortality estimates. We applied the CRF using the attribution 
method. The equation used to calculate PM2.5-attributable mortality from residential solid-fuel use from emis-
sions in North Africa is provided below.

where MRS_North is defined as the number of premature mortalities attributable to residential solid-fuel combustion 
emissions in North Africa, PM2.5,BASE is the estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations the base case simulation, 
and PM2.5,RS_North is the estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations from each of the simulation where residential 
solid-fuel use emissions were turned off in the North, and MBASE is total PM2.5-related mortalities in the base case 
simulation. For each of the five GBD regions of Africa, we used an equivalent version of Equation 2 to calculate 
the annual premature mortalities attributed to emissions from each combustion source in each region.
Measurement data that is available across Africa suggests that ambient PM2.5 concentrations vary substantially 
throughout Africa (Arku, 2015; Arku et al., 2008). Our model resolution does not capture the spatial variability 
of PM2.5 at the city-scale, which may lead to exposure misclassification. Kodros et al. (2016) suggested that lower 
horizontal model grid resolutions may underestimate the fraction of the population that is exposed to higher PM2.5 
concentrations at least for anthropogenic sources that spatially correlate with where people live, meaning that our 
PM2.5-related mortality values may be biased low.
2.3.  Model Evaluation
Insufficient PM2.5 monitoring data exists across Africa (Martin et al., 2019). Therefore, we used annually aver-
aged PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) to evaluate our simulations. These estimates combine data 
from satellites, ground measurements, and chemical-transport models. We evaluated the model using statistical 
metrics: the slope, coefficient of determination (R 2), mean normalized bias, mean bias (MB), mean normalized 
Figure 1.  (a) PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) from the year 2017 regridded to GEOS-Chem resolution (i.e., 2° × 2.5°). (b) GEOS-Chem base case surface

error, mean error, and normalized mean bias (NMB). Hammer et al. (2020) estimates are provided at 0.1° × 0.1° 
degree resolution, so we regridded the data to 2° × 2.5° for the model-estimate comparisons.
3.  Results and Discussion
3.1.  Evaluation of Modeled PM2.5
The global comparison of the Hammer et al. (2020) PM2.5 estimates to the GEOS-Chem estimates for the BASE 
case are given in Figure 1. We acknowledge that the lack of continuous ground-based monitoring of PM2.5 in 
Africa leads to uncertainty in estimated PM2.5 concentrations. The choice and uncertainty of emission inventories 
may also lead to uncertainty in estimated PM2.5 concentrations. Further uncertainty in the percentage of ambient 
PM2.5 that is emitted from a certain source can lead to large uncertainties in premature mortality estimates in 
Africa according Kodros et al. (2018). On an annual global basis compared to Hammer et al. (2020), GEOS-
Chem ambient global PM2.5 estimates have a NMB of −6.9% (Figure 1) a R 2 of 0.776. The negative bias from 
our model ambient PM2.5 will contribute to uncertainties in our PM2.5-attributed premature mortality estimates 
from each of the three combustion sources covered in this study particularly as we cannot evaluate the bias in 
each source separately.
3.2.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for All Three Combustion Sources
Figure  2 shows the percentage change in annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 when all three combustion 
sources are removed. The annual-average percent changes in surface ambient PM2.5 are presented in Table 2. 
Results are presented based on the region of Africa where the air pollution is emitted (i.e., North, Southern, East, 
West, Central) and the region that is impacted by the emissions. In addition to presenting the impacts across the 
five African regions, Table 2 also contains the percent change in ambient PM2.5 concentrations due to emissions 
from each of the five regions to the entire African continent itself and outside of the African continent (Table 2). 
Although the Northern and Southern Hemisphere portions of Africa have different open BB seasons (Ramo 
et al., 2021), we present the annual-average changes in surface ambient PM2.5 because the annual changes are 
used to estimate the impacts of chronic exposure to ambient PM2.5.

Overall, these three combustion sources substantially impact ambient PM2.5 across 
Africa, and they have a non-trivial impact outside of Africa. Across the African conti-
nent, these three sources contribute 28% of annual-average ambient PM2.5 and 6% across 
the globe (Table 2, Figure 2f). Within Africa, the impact is largest over Central Africa, 
where these three combustion sources contribute 72% of the ambient PM2.5 within Africa. 
These  three  sources have the smallest impact on ambient PM2.5 over North Africa (8%).
Across all regions, local emissions from these three sources impact ambient PM2.5 the most 
within the source region itself. For example, local emissions from these three combustion 
sources in Central Africa contribute 49% of the annual average surface ambient PM2.5 within 
that region (Figure 2c), but <10% in the other four African regions. Emissions in Central 
Africa have the largest local impact on ambient PM2.5. The contribution of local emissions 
from these three sources on annual-average ambient PM2.5 concentrations over North Africa 
is the smallest (2%), and this is in part due to the large contribution of dust to ambient PM2.5 
and likely due to a lower population density across the Sahara Desert, which contributes to 
lower emissions in this region.
The impacts of emissions from one region on the annual-average ambient PM2.5 in another 
region depends strongly on meteorology. For example, these three combustion sources in 
East Africa contribute 20% of the annual-average ambient PM2.5 over Central Africa. This 
phenomenon is likely due to the trade winds at these latitudes primarily blowing from East to 
West. Consistent with this, these three combustion sources in Central Africa contribute only 
5% of the annual average ambient PM2.5 within East Africa. These three sources in Central 
Africa contribute 8% of ambient PM2.5 concentrations in the Southern African region due to 
the close proximity of the Southern Africa region to open BB in the southern portion of the 
Central Africa region.
3.3.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Trash Burning
The contribution of trash burning to annual average ambient PM2.5 in each region of Africa 
is shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 and summarized in Table 2. Of the 
three sources investigated here, trash burning contributes the least to annual-average 
ambient PM2.5 (Table 2). Southern Africa contributes the largest percentage of ambient 
PM2.5 from trash burning (1.5% in Southern Africa) followed by East Africa (1.2% in 
East Africa). Although the regional percentages are small, highly populated regions of 
Africa can experience high local ambient PM2.5 contributions from this source. Kodros 
et al. (2016) estimated that the local percent changes of ambient PM2.5 from waste combus-
tion within Africa ranged from 0% to ∼30% in the year 2010. The range of our local percent 
changes (0%–30%) is the same despite using different emissions inventories. The invento-
ries are different because of the assumptions of waste/trash emissions of the CEDSGBD-MAPS 
(McDuffie et  al.,  2020) used in our study. Although CEDSGBD-MAPS incorporated the 
Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) waste combustion inventory, only 30% of generated waste was 
assumed to be combusted as opposed to 60%, as was used in Kodros et al. (2016). The 
reduction was based on a literature survey conducted to understand the fraction of resi-
dential waste that is combusted resulting in the assumption of 30% of uncollected waste is 
burnt by weight in CEDSGBD-MAPS (McDuffie et al., 2020).
Transported air pollution from trash burning had only minor impacts on ambient PM2.5 
concentrations outside of the region where the emissions originated from due to the small 
magnitude of this source. Consistent with the impacts of transport for all three combustion 
sources combined, trash emissions from East Africa have the largest relative impact on ambi-
ent PM2.5 in Central Africa, but even this impact is minor (∼0.3% of annual average ambient 
PM2.5).

3.4.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Residential Solid-Fuel Burning
The contribution of residential solid biofuel burning to annual-average ambient PM2.5 is shown in Figure S4 in 
Supporting Information S1 and summarized in Table 2. Residential combustion is the second largest contributor 
to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 (5%) over Africa when compared to trash (1%) and open BB (22%). 
Residential combustion in East Africa makes the largest local contribution to annual-average surface ambient 
PM2.5 (9% in East Africa) followed by Central Africa (2% in Central Africa). Emissions from this source make 
only a minor contribution (1%) to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 in North Africa. The largest changes in 
regions outside of a source region due to transport were again from emissions in East Africa, where East Africa 
contributes 2% and 1% of the annual average ambient PM2.5 over Central Africa and Southern Africa, respectively.
3.5.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Open BB
Maps showing the contribution of open BB to annual-average ambient PM2.5 in Africa are displayed in Figure 
S5 in Supporting Information S1 with the percentage changes summarized in Table 2. Of the three sources 
investigated here, open BB in Africa makes the largest contribution to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 
across Africa (22%) and globally (5%). Across all the regions, open BB in Central Africa makes the largest local 
contribution to annual-average ambient PM2.5 (45% in Central), followed by meaningful contributions in East 
(21% in East) and Southern Africa (15% in Southern). In contrast, the contribution is much smaller over West 
(5% in West) and North Africa (1% in North). Roberts et al. (2009) reported that most open BB in Africa occurs 
in woodland regions, which is the land cover type primarily found in Central Africa.
Compared to the other two combustion sources, open BB emissions makes a larger contribution to annual-average 
surface ambient PM2.5 concentrations outside of individual source regions. For example, turning off open BB 
emissions in Central Africa decreased ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Southern Africa by 8%, and turning off 
emissions in East Africa reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Central Africa by 17%. Open BB has larger 
impacts because the emissions are greater than trash and residential solid-fuel combustion and because emissions 
from open BB may be lofted to outside of the planetary boundary layer resulting in a longer atmospheric lifetime, 
which increases the likelihood that they will be transported over longer distances (Paugam et al., 2016).
3.6.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality
The annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities attributable to emissions from all three combustion sources from 
each of the African regions and the entire continent are shown in Figure 3. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 but shows 
results for annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities, rather than changes in ambient PM2.5. Using our base-
case scenario, we find that there are 7.6 million (95% confidence interval: 5.3–9.4) annual PM2.5-attributable 
premature mortalities globally from the five causes of death explored here (see Section 2.2). Our global annual

GORDON ET AL.

global premature mortality estimates are similar to R. Burnett et al. (2018) of 8.9 million 
(7.5–10.3) and Lelieveld et  al.  (2020) of 8.8 million (7.11–10.41) deaths. Of these 7.6 
million PM2.5-attributable premature deaths, we find that 203,000 (95% confidence interval: 
133,000–259,000) annual global premature mortalities are attributable to emissions from the 
combination of three combustion sources in Africa, or 10% of total global ambient PM2.5 
premature mortalities. Of the 203,000 annual mortalities attributable to these three sources, 
167,000 of these annual mortalities are within the African continent, which represents 25% of 
total PM2.5 related premature mortalities in Africa. The PM2.5-attributable premature moral-
ities from these sources represent 2% of total annual PM2.5-related premature moralities in 
North Africa, 5% in Southern Africa, 10% in East Africa, 49% in West Africa, and 10% in 
Central Africa.
Following the changes in ambient PM2.5, we found that annual PM2.5-attributable prema-
ture mortalities were mainly driven by emissions within their own region, while transported 
ambient PM2.5 to the surrounding regions resulted in fewer premature mortalities. The largest 
ambient PM2.5 emissions are in West Africa, and these led to the highest number of local 
mortalities when considering all three combustion sources, that is, 43,000 PM2.5-attributable 
mortalities per year in this region. In contrast, Central Africa also has a large number of 
annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities (35,000 mortalities per year) despite the fact that these 
three combustion sources are responsible for larger contributions to ambient PM2.5, compared 
to other regions. This is due to the larger population numbers. Further, despite contributing to 
a relatively large percent of ambient PM2.5 in Southern Africa, these three sources only cause 
9,000 annual PM2.5-attributable deaths in the region.
3.7.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Trash Burning
The map of our estimates of premature mortalities attributed to trash-burning ambient PM2.5 
is shown in Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1 with results summarized in Table 3. We 
find that 11,200 premature mortalities are attributable to ambient PM2.5 from trash combus-
tion across Africa. Of the five regions, the largest number of PM2.5-attributable premature 
mortalities occurs in North Africa (∼5,000 deaths). Kodros et al. (2016) attributed 19,000 
premature adult mortalities to waste combustion PM2.5 in Africa for the year of 2010. This 
estimate is relatively close to the premature mortalities found in our study. These are a few 
differences in the emissions inventories used between the two studies and they also used a 
different concentration-response function. On the other hand, when we compared our esti-
mates to McDuffie et al. (2021) which also used CEDSGBD-MAPS, our estimates are close to 
their premature mortality estimates of 16,000 deaths. Although McDuffie et al. (2021) used 
the same inventory and GEMM concentration-response function, they attributed premature 
mortality estimates to six causes of premature death (IHD, stroke, COPD, LC, LRI, and type 
II diabetes), whereas we use five causes of death for all age groups in our estimates.
3.8.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Residential Burning
We attribute 49,000 annual premature mortalities to ambient PM2.5 from residential solid-
fuel burning in Africa. The regional map of premature mortalities attributed to this source of 
ambient PM2.5 is shown in Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1. Residential combustion 
contributes to the fewest number of PM2.5-attributable mortalities in Southern Africa. On the 
other hand, residential combustion leads to the most premature mortalities in West Africa 
(21,700 mortalities per year). The relatively large population in this region contributes to 
the higher mortality estimates. The effect of population is evident between the contrast of 
Table 2 with Table 3. When residential biofuel burning was removed in West Africa PM2.5 
concentrations were only reduced by 3% within the region (second smallest of any region's 
self-effect). However, this removal led to the most premature mortalities within the source 
region of any of the five regions. The West Africa region is one of the largest populated 
regions in Africa.

Note. The horizontal axis indicates the region where the emissions were turned off, while the vertical axis indicates the region where the mortality was calculated. In addition to the five regions (i.e., 
North, Southern, East, West, and Central), we calculated the mortality across the continent of Africa (indicated by the word Africa) and outside of Africa (indicated by the words Total out). Units are in 
attributable mortalities per year.GeoHealth

3.9.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Open BB
Following the effects on ambient PM2.5 concentrations, open BB contributes to the largest number of annual 
PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1, Table 3). In Africa, this source 
amounts to 106,200 annual premature mortalities, and outside of Africa, it amounts to 20,500 annual premature 
mortalities. Bauer et al. (2019) estimated that open BB leads to 43,000 annual premature deaths in Africa, which 
is lower than our findings. We found that emissions from open BB in Central Africa lead to the largest number of 
annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities within that region (31,000 in Central Africa), and contribute to the largest 
number of PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities across all of Africa (48,300 mortalities per year). Open BB 
in West Africa leads to the second largest number of annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities across the continent, 
with 18,700 in West Africa and 19,900 across all of Africa. Additionally, compared to the other regions, open BB 
in East Africa leads to the largest number of PM2.5-attributable mortalities outside of Africa (8,800 mortalities 
per year).
While previous studies have not investigated all three of these three sources in Africa directly, several studies 
have looked at similar sectors or have included one or more of these sources in health-impact assessments. 
Lacey et al. (2017) estimated 13,210 annual premature deaths from anthropogenic activity (including trans-
portation, household energy generation, waste burning, and home heating and cooking but not open BB) in 
Africa by implementing the Diffuse and Inefficient Combustion Emissions in Africa (DICE-Africa) (Marais & 
Wiedinmyer, 2016) and the 2010 Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutant emissions inventories for 2006. The 
Lacey et al. (2017) study used the Integrated Exposure-Response model (IER) (R. T. Burnett et al., 2014) that 
incorporates relative risk information from ambient air pollution, second tobacco smoke, household solid fuel 
for cooking, and active smoking to estimate premature mortalities for five causes of death including IHD, stroke, 
COPD, and LC. The IER generally produces lower PM2.5-attributable mortality estimates than the GEMM func-
tion that we used in this study. Hence, these lower annual premature mortality estimates from Lacey et al. (2017) 
attributed to anthropogenic activity may be due to the use of this IER model in addition to not including BB. On 
the other hand, Bauer et al. (2019) estimated 780,000 premature deaths annually from PM2.5 from desert dust, 
all anthropogenic activity, and BB in Africa for 2016. In the terms of premature mortalities due to fossil-fuel 
combustion in Africa (not covered in our study), Vohra et al. (2021) calculated 194,000 premature mortalities 
annually in Africa due to fossil-fuel combustion from power generation, industry, ships, aircraft, ground trans-
portation, backup generators, kerosene, and oil/gas extraction for the year 2012. Marais et al. (2019) attributed 
79,000 premature deaths from exposure to ambient PM2.5 fossil fuel use from 2015 emissions in Africa. None of 
these studies are directly comparable to ours due to factors such as differences in sources investigated, emissions 
inventories, atmospheric models, and concentration-response functions. However, despite these differences, the 
estimated number of annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities provided here are similar in magnitude, support-
ing the validity of our results.
4.  Conclusion
We use the GEOS-Chem chemical-transport model to estimate the annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 concen-
trations and annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities from three combustion sources (trash burning, resi-
dential solid-fuel use, and open BB) across Africa for 2017. We estimate the impacts of these three combustion 
sources across five regions of Africa (as defined by the GBD), including both the impacts of emissions from 
each region to each of the African regions as well as outside of Africa. Via a set of sensitivity simulations, we 
show that these sources lead to 203,000 annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities globally and 167,000 
annual premature mortalities in Africa. Ambient PM2.5 from these three combustion sources leads to a substan-
tial number of premature mortalities in Africa compared to the deaths from communicable diseases, such as the 
Ebola Virus (∼11,000 deaths from 2014 to 2016) (Bell, 2016). To our knowledge there are very few health impact 
assessments in this region of the world that are focused on the three combustion sources we examined here.
Overall, the largest impact of PM2.5 emissions occurs in the region of Africa where the emissions occur. However, 
emissions from some regions have substantial impacts on neighboring regions. For example, in East Africa these 
three combustion sourced had substantial impacts on PM2.5 concentrations in Central Africa due to the predom-
inant East-West wind patterns in the tropics. Of the three sources, open BB has the largest impact on ambient 
PM2.5 and annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities in Africa (106,000 per year), followed by residential 
solid-fuel combustion (49,000 per year), and trash combustion (11,000 per year).GeoHealth

Overall, Africa has a unique ambient air pollution profile because sources such as windblown dust and BB 
contribute strongly to PM2.5 levels and PM2.5-related mortality. Although open BB has the largest health impacts, 
this source is probably one of the most difficult of three sources to control or regulate in Africa. Trash and 
residential solid-fuel emissions may be mitigated more easily through financial investments in municipal trash 
collection programs and/or assistance programs that help finance conversions from residential solid-fuel use to 
electric stoves (as well as electrification of rural/remote African regions in general).

Abstract: Municipal solid waste (MSW) can pose a threat to public health if it is not safely managed.
Despite prior research, uncertainties remain and refurbished evidence is needed along with new
approaches. We conducted a systematic review of recently published literature to update and
expand the epidemiological evidence on the association between MSW management practices and
resident populations’ health risks. Studies published from January 2005 to January 2020 were
searched and reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. Eligible MSW treatment or disposal sites were
deﬁned as landﬁlls, dumpsites, incinerators, waste open burning, transfer stations, recycling sites,
composting plants, and anaerobic digesters. Occupational risks were not assessed. Health effects
investigated included mortality, adverse birth and neonatal outcomes, cancer, respiratory conditions,
gastroenteritis, vector-borne diseases, mental health conditions, and cardiovascular diseases. Studies
reporting on human biomonitoring for exposure were eligible as well. Twenty-nine studies were
identiﬁed that met the inclusion criteria of our protocol, assessing health effects only associated with
proximity to landﬁlls, incinerators, and dumpsites/open burning sites. There was some evidence of
an increased risk of adverse birth and neonatal outcomes for residents near each type of MSW site.
There was also some evidence of an increased risk of mortality, respiratory diseases, and negative
mental health effects associated with residing near landﬁlls. Additionally, there was some evidence
of increased risk of mortality associated with residing near incinerators. However, in many cases,
the evidence was inadequate to establish a strong relationship between a speciﬁc exposure and
outcomes, and the studies rarely assessed new generation technologies. Evidence gaps remain, and
recommendations for future research are discussed.

1. Introduction
Municipal solid waste (MSW) poses a threat to public health and the environment
if it is not safely managed from separation, collection, transfer, treatment, and disposal
or recycling and reuse. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the risks
associated with the inadequate disposal of solid waste with respect to soil, water, and
air pollution and the associated health effects for populations surrounding the involved
areas [1].
Globally, MSW generation is expected to increase to 3.40 billion tonnes by 2050 [2].
In general, waste management practices tend to improve going from low-income to high-

income countries [3,4]. As a consequence, the related health risks tend to be greater in
low-income countries, where the most dangerous practices, such as open dumping and
uncontrolled burning of solid waste, are still common [5]. Using published data, Vaccari
et al. [6] compared characteristics of leachate from more than 100 landﬁlls and dumpsites
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and found statistically signiﬁcant concentrations of
pollutants in dumpsites.
Waste treatment and disposal includes recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion,
incineration, landﬁlling, open dumping, and dumping in marine areas [2]. The impact of
solid waste on health may vary depending on numerous factors such as the nature of waste
management practices, characteristics, and habits of the exposed population, duration of
exposure, prevention, and mitigation interventions (if any) [5,7,8]).
An investigation of the relationship between solid waste and human health begins
with hazard identiﬁcation and exposure assessment [1]. Figure 1 schematically represents
the linkages between waste management practices, the respective hazards associated with
these practices, the possible environmental pathways of transmission by which the most
vulnerable or exposed population segments can absorb contaminants, and possible adverse
health outcomes. Different waste management practices result in the release of different
speciﬁc substances, including different environmental matrices that can be involved in
transport and exposure. For example, air is the ﬁrst environmental transport pathway
for burning waste. By-products such as dioxins can be generated, and the ingestion of
contaminated dairy products can represent an indirect source of exposure [9]. Other
practices, such as waste disposal in landﬁlls or dumpsites, can also affect groundwater
through the leaking of leachate [10]; the consequent exposure would be represented by the
ingestion of water contaminated with toxic or carcinogenic compounds [11].
Various reviews have explored the health effects related to solid waste management.
Cointreau [12] published a detailed report on solid waste and health risks for population
and workers, noting that the situation in low-income countries is usually worse. Coin-
treau’s work is probably the most exhaustive of the last 15 years. Porta et al. [13] examined
epidemiological studies on health effects associated with management of solid waste, ex-
cept for dumpsites and open burning areas. Mattiello et al. [14] analyzed the health effects
focusing on people living nearby landﬁlls and incinerators. Ashworth et al. [15] gathered
data focusing on waste incineration and adverse birth outcomes. Ncube et al. [16] consid-
ered epidemiological studies related to municipal solid waste management, assembling
the results based on the health risk (e.g., cancer, birth weight, congenital malformations,
respiratory diseases), but this made difﬁcult a comparison among MSW practices. None
of these reviews analyzed studies published later than 2014. A further systematic review,
recently published [17], focused on waste incinerators’ health impact, considering studies
until 2017. In many cases, the authors suggested that MSW management practices can
pose some adverse health effects for the population residing nearby, although the current
evidence often lacked statistical power, highlighting the need for further investigations.
At the same time, with a moderate level of conﬁdence, some authors derived effects from
old landﬁlls and incinerators, such as an increased risk of congenital malformation within
2 km for landﬁlls and cancer within 3 km for incinerators [13]; other authors [14] found
an increased risk of congenital anomalies mainly nearby special waste landﬁlls, and re-
garding incinerators some authors found some limited risks of cancer and birth defects,
highlighting changes in technology are producing more reassuring results [14]. Still, the
previous reviews rarely analyzed the changing operational standards associated with the
evolving legislation. Although their approach can represent a prudent strategy, it limited
the interpretation of some data. Only Mattiello et al. [14] conducted this type of analysis.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the linkages between solid waste management practices and possible adverse
health outcomes.
Focusing on composting facilities, two systematic reviews analyzed health outcomes,
but only considered bioaerosols exposure [18,19]. In both studies, the authors concluded
that there is insufﬁcient evidence to provide a quantitative comment on the risk to nearby
residents, although there is sufﬁcient evidence to support a precautionary approach, and
further research is needed.
In most of the reviews mentioned above, vector-borne diseases (such as malaria)
were not included. Only Ncube et al. [16] cited one study about malaria [20] and Coin-
treau [12] mentioned a couple of old studies related to vector-borne diseases. Although one
recent review [21] focused on the link between solid waste and vector-borne diseases, the
methodology and results did not follow a systematic procedure, and appeared excessively
approximate.
Additionally, the PRISMA methodology, characterizing a recently recommended
systematic review approach [22,23], was rarely implemented. Only in the works of Pearson
et al. [18], [19] and Tait et al. [17] was it applied, i.e., in studies that only involved a speciﬁc
solid waste management practice.
Therefore, despite such prior reviews, uncertainties remain. In many cases, how future
research should be developed was not addressed enough. Additionally, the inﬂuence of na-
tional legislation, characterizing operational standards and technological level, was rarely
investigated. Furthermore, WHO [1] noted that the health effects of waste management
and disposal activities are only partly understood. In some cases, it is challenging to apply
estimates and evidence from studies related to high levels of emissions from the past to
new-generation incineration plants. It has to be highlighted that solid waste legislation
inﬂuences the technological level and emission limits associated with solid waste man-
agement plants, such as landﬁlls and incinerators. Indeed, in many European countries,
modern technology has been reducing noxious emissions, and measurable health impacts
have, in many cases, become smaller. For example, even the review of Tait et al. [17], in
which the authors focused on incinerators’ publications until 2017, should be renewed,
based on more recent and robust studies (e.g., [24,25]). At the same time, it has to be
considered that the so-called emerging contaminants (ECs) are not commonly monitoredInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

in the environment, but they have the potential to enter the environment and cause known
or suspected adverse health effects [26]. In addition, many new chemicals are constantly
approved for commercial use; for example, over 40,000 chemicals are actively being man-
ufactured, processed, and imported in the United States, but the health effects of few of
them have been monitored in the population [27,28]. Such substances can easily reach the
solid waste phase, leading to underestimated adverse health outcomes. Besides, countries
with weak environmental legislations can be affected by additional risks. For instance,
some persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are still in production and use in countries that
have not ratiﬁed the Stockholm Convention, such as in Southern Asia [29]. Consequently,
updated evidence is needed for the policy debate.
Thus, we have undertaken the present systematic review in order to update and
expand on previous reviews, based on the PRISMA statement [23]. Speciﬁcally, the objective
was to assess and summarize the evidence on the association between municipal solid
waste (MSW) management practices and health risks to populations residing nearby. Data
were gathered and analyzed in a different way compared with the studies aforementioned.
After summarizing the results, the ﬁndings are discussed in detail in the Discussion section,
considering the inﬂuence of national legislation and the technological level in the case of
landﬁlls and incinerators. It represents the main novelty of the topic. Furthermore, the
update of the recent scientiﬁc literature related to MSW and health outcomes using the
PRISMA statement was provided, also taking into consideration that some categories, such
as dumpsites and vector-borne diseases, were not adequately analyzed in previous reviews.
Such a comprehensive approach represented an added value to the manuscript. Finally,
we also discussed how further research should be conducted.
2. Methods
The methods used in this review were developed based on the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [22,23]. The PRISMA
is a procedure that originated in 2009, consisting of a 27-item checklist and a PRISMA ﬂow
diagram [23] that helps authors develop the systematic review in a well-structured way
to address recent advances in the science of systematic reviews. The complete procedure
is available in the protocol registered on PROSPERO [30], an international database of
prospectively registered systematic reviews.
2.1. Deﬁnitions
Some of the technical terms used in this review are deﬁned below.
•
Municipal solid waste (MSW): any material from residential, commercial, and insti-
tutional activities which is discarded. It is important to note that industrial, medical,
hazardous, electronic, and construction and demolition wastes belong to other cate-
gories [2].
•
Engineered landﬁll: site characterized by the registration and placement/compaction
of waste. Such landﬁlls typically use daily cover material, surface and ground water
monitoring, infrastructure, and a waterproof liner at the bottom [6].
•
Sanitary landﬁll: site characterized by the registration and placement/compaction
of waste. Best practices include a waterproof liner at the bottom, leachate and gas
collection systems, daily cover, a ﬁnal top cover and closure, infrastructure as well as
a post-closure plan [6].
•
Dumpsites: open and unregulated areas or holes in the ground with no environmental
protection and disposal controls [6]. Due to lack of controls, dumpsites may receive
different waste streams including MSW, sewage sludge, hazardous waste, electronic
waste, healthcare waste [31].
•
Transfer stations: facilities in which waste is transferred from smaller vehicles used
for waste collection into bigger vehicles for hauling to a disposal or treatment site [32].Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331
5 of 26
•
Incinerators: a specialized engineered system where waste is burned. Through com-
bustion waste is converted into ash, ﬂue gas, and heat. The ﬂue gases are treated to
reduce impact of air pollution on environment and health. Energy from an incinerator
can be recovered [32].
•
Open burning of waste: burning of solid waste in open areas without air pollution
controls [32].
Dumpsites and open burning were categorised together since burning waste in dump-
sites is a common practice, especially in low- and middle-income countries [5,12], making it
impossible to split it into two separate categories. As the deﬁnition of dumpsites suggests,
it was not always possible to assure a clear distinction between MSW and other categories
of waste. As a consequence, dumpsites were excluded in cases where the sites did not
receive MSW but only other categories of solid waste. Furthermore, in many cases it was
not possible to ﬁnd a clear distinction between sanitary and engineered landﬁlls among
the publications, as a consequence the two categories were combined. However, as will
be discussed later, such deﬁnitions of landﬁlls and incinerators need to be contextualised.
Indeed, the fast-evolving technologies and more restrictive legislation [1] can inﬂuence the
emission limits and the related health outcomes.
2.2. Study Eligibility
As detailed more fully in the review protocol, studies were eligible for inclusion in
the review if they met speciﬁed criteria for population, exposure, and health effects. The
eligible population and exposures were persons, both children and adults, living, studying,
or spending time near MSW treatment or disposal sites, such as landﬁlls, dumpsites, incin-
erators, areas in which open burning of waste is conducted, transfer stations, recycling sites,
composting plants, and anaerobic digesters. Eligible comparators were residents who were
not exposed, residents with a lower level of exposure and residents located at different
distances from MSW treatment or disposal sites. Occupational risks and therefore waste
workers (regular or informal) were not assessed, because they were related to a further
category, subjected to different exposures also in terms of time. Health effects included
mortality, adverse birth and neonatal outcomes, respiratory conditions, cancer, gastroenteri-
tis, vector-borne diseases, mental and social health conditions, and cardiovascular diseases.
Studies reporting on human biomonitoring for exposure were also eligible. The inclusion
of transfer stations and vector-borne diseases [33] as an outcome was a modiﬁcation from
the pre-speciﬁed protocol submitted to PROSPERO. However, no changes were made to
the search strategy as a result of this addition.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the following non-randomized controlled
studies (NRS) were included: quasi-RCTs, non-RCTs, controlled before-and-after studies,
interrupted-time-series studies, historically controlled studies, case-control studies, cohort
studies, and cross-sectional studies that include a comparison group. Studies were excluded
if they reported qualitative data only.
To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be peer reviewed and published in English.
2.3. Search Strategy; Screening and Data Extraction; Narrative Review
The search for eligible studies was conducted using relevant search engines (i.e.,
Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar) with a combination of keywords based on possible
MSW exposure and health effects. Further details regarding the electronic search strategy,
including the keywords and string, are available in the protocol. Studies published from
January 2005 to January 2020 were examined.
Following an initial screening of paper titles and abstracts, the full paper was examined
for eligibility by a single reviewer. Thereafter, data were extracted from eligible studies
and compiled solely from the paper.
Due to substantial differences between the studies included in terms of settings,
populations, study designs, contexts, MSW management practices, exposure assessment,
case deﬁnitions, outcome deﬁnitions and outcome assessment, it was determined that aInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

pooled analysis using meta-analysis or meta-regression was not appropriate. Accordingly,
this review adopted a narrative approach.
2.4. Risk of Bias; Quantity and Strength of Evidence
One reviewer assessed the risk of bias associated with experimental studies, based on
the Liverpool Quality Assessment Tool (LQAT), an adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale [34]. Observational studies were automatically scored as having a very serious risk of
bias due to the many potential sources of bias inherent in the study design.
Finally, the strength of evidence was summarized to develop the different health
outcomes as a function of the categories of exposure analyzed (e.g., landﬁlls, dumpsites).
The following values were given: (0) no studies; (−) studies, but no evidence of increased
risk; (+) studies, providing some evidence of increased risk; (++) studies, with stronger
evidence of increased risk. The ﬁndings are discussed in detail in the discussion section
taking also into consideration the technological level of the units in the case of landﬁlls and
incinerators.
3. Results
3.1. Study Selection
A total of 253 studies, including 33 reviews and reports, were initially identiﬁed.
After adjusting for duplicates, 236 remained. Of these, 37 studies were discarded after
reviewing the abstracts (if any) because it appeared these papers clearly did not meet the
criteria. The full text of the remaining 199 publications was examined in more detail. A
total of 170 studies did not meet the inclusion criteria previously described. Twenty-nine
studies met the inclusion criteria and are included in this review. The PRISMA ﬂow chart
describing the process for determining study eligibly appears in Figure 2 below. All studies
screened are available in Supplementary Materials.

3.2. MSW Transfer and Treatment Sites
Although the review sought to summarize studies investigating health effects asso-
ciated with MSW transfer and treatment sites, we did not identify any eligible studies.
Speciﬁcally, no studies were found that met the review’s inclusion criteria for health effects
associated with proximity to transfer stations, recycling centers, composting plants, and
anaerobic digesters.
3.3. MSW Disposal Sites
Tables 1–6 summarize the results. In particular, in terms of the methodology used in
each paper, the results concerning MSW disposal sites are summarized in Table 1 (landﬁlls),
Table 3 (incinerators) and Table 5 (dumpsites and open burning). The studies are listed in
alphabetical order by author. In terms of health outcomes, the results are summarized in
Table 2 (landﬁlls), Table 4 (incinerators), and Table 6 (dumpsites and open burning). In
Tables 2, 4 and 6, the results are gathered based on the eight categories of health outcomes
previously mentioned (i.e., mortality, adverse birth and neonatal outcomes, respiratory
conditions, gastroenteritis, vector-borne diseases, mental and social health conditions,
cardiovascular diseases, human biomonitoring). Consequently—in Tables 2, 4 and 6—the
same research can be cited multiple times if different outcomes were assessed within the
same study. Additionally, when an adverse health effect resulted in p < 0.05, it was bolded
within the table. However, the publications rarely mentioned technological elements and
emission limits characterizing landﬁlls and incinerators in the case study. Therefore, we
carried out an additional investigation to address this aspect.
3.3.1. Landﬁlls
We identiﬁed nine studies relating to landﬁlls (Table 1). These were mainly conducted
in Europe (5) and North America (2). Only one was from Asia (China) and one from Africa
(South Africa). Five papers were retrospective cohort studies and four were cross-sectional
studies.
The overall evidence of health risks associated with residing near a landﬁll is mixed
(Table 2). Considering results with a signiﬁcance of p < 0.05, there is some evidence
increased risk of mortality for lung cancer [35], births with congenital anomalies [36], and
negative respiratory conditions in people aged ≤14 years, considering both all respiratory
diseases and only acute respiratory infections [35], association between increase of PM2.5
concentration and reduction of forced vital capacity in children aged 6–12 years [37],
mucosal irritation and upper respiratory symptoms [38], and other mild symptoms [39,40].
There was also some evidence of worsening mental and social health conditions, such
as alteration of daily activities or negative mood states [38]. Other studies, however,
found no evidence of mortality or adverse health effects. Indeed, Mataloni et al. [35]
did not ﬁnd evidence of increased mortality for other speciﬁc cancers (i.e., colorectal,
kidney, liver, pancreas, larynx, bladder, stomach, brain, and lymphatic tissue) as well as
for cardiovascular, digestive, ischemic heart, respiratory, and urinary system diseases. For
congenital anomalies, no evidence of increased cases was found by Elliott et al. [41]. Jarup
et al. [42] found no evidence of increased risk of birth with Down’s Syndrome. No evidence
of increased speciﬁc cardiovascular diseases (cardiac, ischemic, and cerebrovascular) was
found by Mataloni et al. [35]. Neither evidence of increased risk of asthma [35,39] nor
gastrointestinal symptoms [38] was found.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

health outcomes including reproductive, developmental and neurodevelopmental effects [54,55]; m Values expressed in terms of Toxic
Equivalence (TEQ) were assessed. Indeed, TEQs are calculated values that allow to compare the toxicity of different combinations of
dioxins and dioxin-like compounds; in order to calculate a TEQ, a toxic equivalent factor (TEF) is assigned to each member of the dioxin
and dioxin-like compounds category. TEFs have been established through international agreements and currently range from 1 to 0.0001
[56]; n EFSA et al. [57] considered a threshold value in serum of 7.0 pg/g fat. Furthermore, they established a Tolerable Weekly Intake
(TWI) of 2 pg TEQ/kg bw per week. WHO [55] indicates a provisional tolerable intake of 70 pg/kg bw per month for PCDDs, PCDFs and
coplanar PCBs expressed as TEFs. It has to be noted that although several studies showed a positive association with cancer, there was no
clear dose–response relationship between exposure and cancer development [57]; at the same time, WHO [55] noted since dioxins induce
tumors and likely other effects via a receptor-mediated mechanism, tolerable intake guidance based on non-cancer end-points observed at
lower doses is considered protective for carcinogenicity. o p < 0.05. When data ﬁt the normal distribution, two independent sample t-tests
were performed by the authors to compare the mean levels of the two groups. Otherwise, the Mann–Whitney U test was performed. p p <
0.05. If the data ﬁtted the normal distribution, two independent sample t-tests were performed by the authors to compare the mean levels
of the two groups. Otherwise, the non-parametric test was performed.

3.3.2. Incinerators
Table 2 summarizes the evidence related to incinerators. A total of 13 studies were
identiﬁed, 10 of which were conducted in Europe and three in Asia. Seven papers were
retrospective cohort studies, one was a prospective cohort study, three were case-control
studies and two were cross-sectional studies.
Considering results with a signiﬁcance of p < 0.05, like landﬁlls, the evidence of
increased health risks from residing near an incinerator is mixed. A study reported
increased risk of mortality in women for various health outcomes, including cancer [44].
There is also evidence of adverse birth and neonatal outcomes—i.e., preterm births [45],
congenital heart defects, genital system defects and hypospadias [25], urinary tract birth
defects [46]. Furthermore, human biomonitoring studies suggest higher levels of dioxins
found in residents near incinerators [9,47]. Other studies, however, found no evidence of
adverse health effects. In particular, Viel et al. [48] found no evidence of increased invasive
breast cancer in women aged 20–59 years, even founding a signiﬁcant reduction in invasive
breast cancer in women aged 60 years and over. Ranzi et al. [44] found no evidence of
increased cancer diseases both in men and women. Several studies reported no evidence of
many adverse birth outcomes [24,25,45,46,49–51]. Ranzi et al. [44] found neither evidence
of increased risk of cardiovascular diseases nor respiratory issues. There was also no
evidence of increased mortality in men for various health outcomes, including cancer.
3.3.3. Dumpsites and Open Burning
Table 3 summarizes the effects of residing near dumpsites and open burning. This
includes a total of seven studies, one of which was carried on in Latin America, two in
North America and four in Africa. Three were retrospective cohort studies, and four were
cross-sectional studies.
Once again, the evidence of adverse health effects from the exposure is mixed. Consid-
ering results with a signiﬁcance of p < 0.05, there is some evidence suggesting that residing
near dumpsites is associated with increased risk of adverse birth or neonatal outcomes
in terms of low birth weight [58]. However, most studies found no evidence of adverse
health effects, including mortality [59], and congenital malformations [60]. In terms of
gastroenteritis, all studies were from Africa and cross-sectional [20,61–63], but the results
were mixed and not statistically signiﬁcant. Malaria was the only vector-borne disease
that studies were identiﬁed for. The same four studies that reported on gastroenteritis also
reported on malaria, and the evidence suggested that there may be an increased risk of
malaria for nearby residents, although none of the results were statistically signiﬁcant.
3.4. Study Quality
All studies that met the established inclusion criteria for this review were observational
studies, and thus were automatically scored as having a very serious risk of bias due
to the many potential sources of inherent bias with these study designs. In particular,
many included studies suffered from deﬁciencies such as lack of control for potential
confounders, small sample size, unclear case deﬁnitions, reliance on self-reported data,
and/or the inclusion of several different health outcomes which could increase the type I
error rate.
3.5. Summary of Results
Table 7 summarizes the quantity and strength of the evidence related to MSW sites
and health outcomes by type of MSW exposure and outcome. In general, there is a paucity
of evidence, with no studies for certain exposures and outcomes. This is particularly true
in the case of mental health and social health conditions and in biomonitoring, and for
most health outcomes associated with dumpsites and open burning. Only mortality and
adverse birth outcomes have at least one study for each type of exposure.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

outcomes including reproductive, developmental, and neurodevelopmental effects [54,55]; b Strength of evidence: 0: no studies; (−): No
evidence of increased risk; (+): Some evidence of increased risk; (++): Strong evidence of increased risk. The number in parentheses
beside each symbol represents the total number of studies that assessed each health outcome (which are reported in detail in Tables 2, 4
and 6). Although the evidence for some outcomes was mixed, this number includes all the available studies, including both studies ﬁnding
evidence and studies ﬁnding no evidence of an increased risk for each outcome.
In addition to the dearth of evidence, the results are mixed. There was evidence to
suggest an increased risk of adverse birth and neonatal outcomes for all types of MSW sites,
whereas for other outcomes there was either a lack of evidence for one or more MSW site
type or varied evidence of health effects for different kinds of MSW sites. There was also
some evidence of health outcomes for landﬁlls and incinerators compared to dumpsites or
open burning sites. However, legislation that could characterize landﬁlls and incinerators
in each country should be taken into account. This aspect is addressed in the Discussion
section below.
4. Discussion
We conducted a systematic review of literature published within the past 15 years
(January 2005 to January 2020) to assess and summarize the epidemiological evidence
on the association between MSW treatment or disposal sites and health risks to resident
populations. The 29 studies that met the inclusion criteria investigated the health effects
associated with living nearby landﬁlls (9 studies), incinerators (13 studies), and dumpsites
or open burning sites (7 studies). Health outcomes included a large range of conditions,
including mortality, cancer, adverse birth and neonatal conditions, cardiovascular diseases,
respiratory conditions, gastroenteritis, vector-borne diseases, and mental health conditions.
Three studies reported on biomarkers of disease rather than actual health conditions.
Overall, the results were mixed or limited. The most consistent evidence was on the
adverse birth and neonatal outcomes, with studies identifying increased risks associated
with living near all three types of MSW disposal sites. There was some evidence of in-
creased risk of mortality associated with living near landﬁlls or incinerators. We found no
evidence suggesting an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, gastroenteritis, or
vector-borne diseases. There were no studies on these outcomes in respect of landﬁlls or
dumpsites and cancer, dumpsites/burning and cardiovascular diseases, or incinerators
and gastroenteritis, and landﬁlls or incinerators and vector-borne diseases. Mental health
conditions were investigated only in the case of landﬁlls, where there was evidence of
adverse effects. Similarly, human biomonitoring was explored only in the case of incin-
erators where there was evidence of an increased level of PCDD/F in children’s blood
and mother’s breast milk in studies in China [9,47] but not in Spain [53]. As outlined, the
publications rarely mentioned technological elements and emission limits regarding solid
waste management for the case studies. Therefore, we carried out additional investigations
to ﬁll this gap.
With respect to proximity to landﬁlls, there was evidence of an increased risk of
congenital anomalies in a retrospective cohort study by Palmer et al. [36]; while in another
cohort study Elliot et al. [41] did not ﬁnd evidence of increased risk. However, Palmer
et al. [36] and Elliot et al. [41] studied landﬁlls that were operational between the early 1980s
and the late 1990s in the UK. Landﬁlls in the UK were regulated by the Control of Pollution
Act [64], replaced by the Waste Management Licensing Regulations in 1994 [65], and, theInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

UK only fulﬁlled the European Landﬁll Directive [66] to improve standards and reduce
adverse effects on the environment in 2002. As a consequence, the two studies were related
to the impact of old landﬁlls, i.e., from the previous generation used in the UK. There
appears to also be an increased risk in mortality for lung cancer and respiratory diseases,
as well as increased morbidity related to respiratory diseases, mainly among youths and
children [35,37,38]. In particular, Mataloni et al. [35] considered the association to landﬁll
H2S exposure (used as a tracer in the air). When they repeated the analysis using the
distance from landﬁll instead of H2S concentration, there were no signiﬁcant associations
between mortality outcomes and living 0–2 km from a landﬁll compared to 3–5 km. Models
that consider the pathways of contaminants instead of only focusing on the distance are
likely more accurate. However, Mataloni et al. [35] considered the health effects of landﬁlls
in Italy between 1996 and 2008, and the European Landﬁll Directive [66] was implemented
in 2003 [67] in Italy, and by 2009 the landﬁlls that were already operational had to be
adapted to the new legislation. All landﬁlls included in Mataloni et al. [35] were activated
before the new Italian legislation. Consequently, it can be assumed that the ﬁndings refer to
the effect of the old generation landﬁlls in the country. Furthermore, the study of Gumede
and Savage [37] was carried out in South Africa, in which the operational standards related
to landﬁlls are less restrictive than the most recent European directives [68]. In addition,
Heaney et al. [37] found an increased risk of alteration of daily activities and negative mood
states, but the cross-sectional study included only 23 participants. However, the research
of Heaney et al. [38] was carried out in North Carolina (USA) in 2009, but the Federal
Regulation concerning MSW landﬁlls was revised in 2011, addressing some major aspects
including operating practices and composite liners requirements [69]. Therefore, even in
this case, the adverse health outcomes related to new generation landﬁlls in the USA could
be lower. In the studies included in this systematic review, there was no other evidence of
increased risks related to other kind of diseases. In addition, it must be noted that none
of the studies on landﬁlls explicitly focused on potential leachate pollution and related
human health risks. Indeed, even modern landﬁlls with good quality geomembranes
can sometimes leak leachate due to thermal expansion of the material, folds generated
during installation or initial defect density, causing potential risk for water bodies and
its consumers; as a consequence, the risks related to landﬁlls are not only due to air
emissions [70].
Likewise, there is mixed and limited evidence on the health effects associated with liv-
ing near incinerators. It is also important to consider the type of incinerators and emissions
control technologies being implemented when assessing health effects. MSW incinerators
operating in Europe before the Waste Incineration Directive [71] can be considered from
the old generation of incinerators. After the implementation of the directive, that existing
plants needed to comply with by the end of December 2005, the corresponding incinerators
can be assumed to be from the new generation. Further improvements were made in 2018
when the new Best Available Techniques (BATs) for waste treatment was adopted by the
European Commission [72], and the MSW incinerators that were already operational have
four years to comply with the new standards. Thus, the last category can be assumed as the
newest generation, for which no epidemiological studies exist. Regarding the research in-
cluded in Table 4, two retrospective cohort studies [24,45] assessing European incinerators
between 2003 and 2010 obtained different results for preterm births. Compared to Ghosh
et al. [24], Candela et al. [45] used a smaller buffer zone around each incinerator, namely
4 km instead of 10 km. According to Ghosh et al. [24] this difference in approach may have
led to fewer outcomes with a lower estimated exposure included. Additionally, in Candela
et al. [45], which was carried out in Italy, the estimated annual average exposure to PM10
from incinerators in the study areas was 0.96 ng/m3 in 2003, decreasing to 0.26 ng/m3
in 2010 because of the improvements of the incineration plant during the study period.
However, the annual average exposure to PM10 estimated in Ghosh et al. [24] was in the
same order of magnitude. In terms of birth with congenital anomalies of the genital system,
Parkes et al. [25] found an association with distance from incinerators but not PM10. GhoshInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331

et al. [24] and Parkes et al. [25] assessed an intermediate period between old and new
generation plants; indeed, for the existing plants the new directive became operational in
the end of December 2005. Therefore, although the epidemiological studies mentioned
above are among the widest and most recent, their ﬁndings can be assumed to be a tran-
sition period, between old and new generation plants. Updated research is necessary,
only focusing on emissions from new and newest generation plants. In a retrospective
cohort study involving residents in Forly (Italy), Ranzi et al. [44] found a general higher
rate of mortality in women and also a higher rate of mortality considering all types of
cancer in women. However, the authors analyzed a cohort of people until 2003. As a
consequence, the results are only related to old generation plants. Furthermore, Cordier
et al. [46] found an increased risk of urinary track birth defects (UTBD) in infants exposed
to MSW incineration dioxins (both atmospheric and deposits). In addition, the ﬁndings of
Cordier et al. [46] suggested that consumption of local food modiﬁed the risk, increasing
it in exposed areas. However, the authors analyzed the outputs between 2001 and 2004;
therefore, the incinerators belonged to the old generation sites [73]. Noteworthy, Parkes
et al. [25] found no evidence of increased risk of UTBD, and their study analyzed more
recent incinerators. Regarding biomonitoring studies, Xu et al. [9,47] found higher levels
of dioxins in residents near incinerators in China. In contrast, the values from a study
conducted in Spain [53] were uncertain, varying over the years and often being greater in
unexposed groups. However, it is important to highlight in the studies of Xu et al. [9,47]
that the samples were collected in China in 2013, i.e., before the approval of more restrictive
legislation for MSW incinerators emissions in 2014 [74]. The new Chinese legislation has
standards comparable to those of the European Union [74]. Consequently, updated studies
are necessary.
As highlighted in the studies discussed above, the deﬁnitions of landﬁlls and incinera-
tors need to be contextualized based on the evolving technologies and national/international
legislation [1]. For example, European incinerators’ current emission limits are more restric-
tive than a couple of decades ago. Therefore, many health outcomes related to such new
generation plants appear to be lower than in the past. However, the results from such old
generation plants can continue to be suitable in areas where less restrictive limits continue
to be applied, such as in some developing countries [75].
Many results are also consistent with the systematic review of Ncube et al. [16], in
which the authors found landﬁlls and incinerators presented adverse health endpoints
even if epidemiological evidence in reviewed articles were often inadequate. However, as
discussed above, although the operational standards have changed over time, they were
not considered by Ncube et al. [16].
As many dumpsites also practice open burning, it was not possible to assess the effects
of these separately. An increased risk of adverse birth outcomes was found for low birth
weight and intrauterine growth retardation. However, the main related study [58] did not
expressly specify if the dumpsites were all for MSW. The lack of studies on dumpsites and
open burning is especially noteworthy given the widespread prevalence of these methods
for disposing of MSW [5].
In addition, four studies assessed the association between vector-borne diseases and
dumpsites [20,61–63]. Although these were cross-sectional studies with small sample sizes,
making the evidence too weak to link to an increased risk, they analyzed important health
outcomes rarely taken into account. Besides, an increased risk of malaria in people resid-
ing closer to dumpsites was noted by some authors [20,62,63], offering some suggestive
evidence of this adverse health effect. Still, more robust studies are needed.
Overall, many of the studies that were identiﬁed and included in this review were of
low quality, therefore the potential for causal inference from the studies is limited. While
randomized controlled trials of these conditions are probably not possible, there may be
opportunities for future studies to use natural experiments or time series analyses. All
of the included studies followed observational study designs and presented signiﬁcant
potential for bias and confounding. For example, important measures of exposure suchInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331
22 of 26
as length of time, activity, technological characteristics, and distance to the hazard, were
not always controlled. Case deﬁnitions were not always clear, and the methods for case
ascertainment in some cases was reported rather than clinically conﬁrmed. In addition,
given the range of types of studies and the exposures and outcomes measured, the use of a
narrative, as opposed for example, to a meta-analysis or meta-regression was effective in
searching, screening, and extracting the necessary data for the review.
This review focused on health effects associated with residing near MSW sites and our
ﬁndings are limited to only nearby resident populations. A limitation of this work is that it
does not consider the health of the larger community in relation to solid waste management
or the differential health effects associated with varying levels of MSW management. For
example, even if there are some negative health risks for nearby residents of MSW sites,
appropriate solid waste management could overall be helpful for the health of populations
at large. Living near unmanaged solid waste could also lead to greater negative health
impacts than living near a managed solid waste site and this review did not perform a
comparative analysis for different types of solid waste management situations (such as
no waste management, poorly managed MSW sites, well management MSW sites, and
reduced waste generation).
In future, in addition to epidemiological studies, consideration should be given to
conducting biomonitoring research. Indeed, focusing on the burning of solid waste (both
in incinerators and through uncontrolled open burning) most general population exposure
to dioxin (PCDD/F) is through ingestion of contaminated foods of animal origin [55], with
approximately 80–90% of the total exposure via fats in ﬁsh, meat, and dairy products [76].
Generally, levels of dioxins in air are very low, except close to sources such as inefﬁcient
incinerators or open burning. Releases into the air ends up contaminating soil and aquatic
sediments and can lead to bioaccumulation and bioconcentration through food chains [55].
Furthermore, dioxins decompose very slowly in the environment, remaining there for
very long periods [76]. Thus, the biomonitoring of the presence of dioxins as well as other
persistent pollutants in farm animals and their derivatives nearby incinerators would be
useful. Some works have already been carried out and can be taken as references for future
research. For example, Cordier et al. [46] analyzed the association between local food
consumption, dioxin deposits generated by MSW incinerators and risk of urinary tract
birth defects. More recently, Xu et al. [9] studied the concentration of dioxins on eggs close
to an MSW incinerator in China.
In addition, the biomonitoring studies should be extended to other waste practices.
The work of Scaramozzino et al. [77] can be considered as well. The authors conducted the
ﬁrst proposal for a standardized protocol for farm animal biomonitoring that can be useful
for both environmental and human risk assessments.
Furthermore, technical aspects inﬂuenced by national legislation should be investi-
gated further. This would allow for easier comparisons between evolving technologies for
which environmental and health impacts tend to decrease.
5. Conclusions
In conducting this systematic review, 29 studies were identiﬁed that met the inclusion
criteria of our protocol, assessing health effects only associated with proximity to landﬁlls,
incinerators, and dumpsites/open burning sites. Compared to most previous reviews,
national legislation’s inﬂuence—characterizing operational standards and technological
level—was investigated. There was some evidence of an increased risk of adverse birth
and neonatal outcomes for residents near landﬁlls, incinerators, and dumpsites/open
burning sites. There was also some evidence of an increased risk of mortality, respiratory
diseases, and negative mental health effects associated with residing near landﬁlls. Addi-
tionally, there was some evidence of increased risk of mortality associated with living near
incinerators. However, in many cases, the evidence was inadequate to establish a strong
relationship between a speciﬁc exposure and outcomes. Additionally, most landﬁlls and
incinerators investigated referred to the old generation of technologies, although studiesInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 4331
23 of 26
on new generations’ plants are starting to be published. Therefore, future research should
focus on new generation landﬁlls and incinerators, to have a more speciﬁc analysis of these
upgraded MSW practices. Additionally, the health effects related to the open burning of
waste need further investigation, and the association between dumpsites in developing
countries and vector-borne diseases require more robust epidemiological studies.
However, none of the 29 studies that we identiﬁed investigated the health effects
associated with MSW transfer and treatment, such as transfer stations, recycling centers,
composting plants, and anaerobic digesters. This appears to be a major gap in the literature
since transfer and treatment facilities are widespread and could pose health risks including
exposure to toxins, particulate or infectious agents via direct contact, and aerosolization
or other pathways. Since these health risks are potentially different from those associated
with MSW disposal sites, future research must address this gap to assess relative risks
associated with various management and disposal options.

Abstract: The burning of crop residue in the open ﬁeld has become a signiﬁcant concern for climate
change mitigation efforts worldwide. This practice has led to air quality impairment, smog, haze,
heat waves, and different health problems. These could be avoided by adopting sustainable crop
residue management practices (SCRMPs) and enabling farmers to engage in SCRMPs. Assessing
the health effects at the household level is critical for understanding this problem and ﬁnding a
solution. Using the primary dataset of 420 farmers from Punjab, Pakistan, we estimated the incurred
impacts and costs of crop residue burning. We calculated the health and environmental beneﬁts
associated with adopting SCRMPs by comparing the two groups of farmers (adopters and non-
adopters). Furthermore, we used a propensity score matching technique to measure the causal impact
of SCRMPs adoption on health costs. The ﬁndings showed that a surprisingly large number of
farmers are all aware of the adverse effects of residue burning, and many do not burn crop residues
and instead use SCRMPs. This study found that households with chronic and non-chronic diseases
become acute, and the severity increases during the burning period. They spend USD 13.37 to USD
8.79 on chronic and non-chronic diseases during the burning season, respectively. Consequently, the
use of SCRMPs has a positive effect on healthcare costs. Our study ﬁndings highlight the meaningful
implications for developing a new policy to promote the sustainable utilization of crop residues and
enhance their adoption in Pakistan.

1. Introduction
Economic development and rapid population growth have put intense pressure on the
agriculture sector to fulﬁll rising industrial and food demands [1–3]. As a result, intensive
agriculture with high use of inputs and the introduction of modern technologies has
developed rapidly in recent decades [4–6]. The use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, as
well as the extension of cultivated land, exploitation of natural resources, and burning of
crop residues to clear ﬁelds for preparations of the new crops have all resulted in a slew of
environmental issues [7–10], including water contamination, air quality impairment, the

emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and soil degradation [11–13]. These problems are not
only impairing environmental sustainability but also pose a severe threat to human health.
Increasing greenhouse gas emissions due to rapid industrialization and urbanization
in developing countries have contributed to the changing climate [14]. Furthermore,
crop residue burning has proven to be a non-point source of greenhouse gas emissions
in many agrarian economies, including Pakistan [12,15]. Over the past few decades,
Pakistan’s agriculture sector has been under tremendous pressure to meet the food needs
of a population of more than 220 million, rising at rate of nearly 2% each year [16]. This
immense pressure has led to the intensiﬁcation of agriculture and multiple cropping across
the country. The current cropping intensity (159%) also shows intense competition between
different crops due to the harvesting and sowing seasons overlapping.
Consequently, farmers often engaged in unsustainable practices such as burning crop
residues to clear ﬁelds for the following crop [17,18]. In recent years, massive crop residue
burning has resulted in air quality deterioration, smog, haze, heat waves, and different
health issues [19–22]. In severe circumstances, it has led to an emergency situation with
several deaths, thousands of hospital admissions, temporary closure of airports, highways,
and schools [22–25], as well as signiﬁcant economic losses [26,27].
Given the growing adverse impacts of crop residue burning, adopting sustainable
and environmentally friendly residue management practices is required to safeguard the
environment and people’s health [28–30]. Numerous studies have reported several envi-
ronmentally friendly crop residue management practices [31–33] that provide additional
economic beneﬁts through generating income and reducing healthcare expenses. However,
the adoption rate is quite low, even though the positive impacts of sustainable crop residue
management practices (SCRMPs) are widely studied, understood, and implementable at
the local level [34–37]. The low adoption rate may be due to a lack of information about the
beneﬁts of such strategies, particularly their environmental and health implications.
Limited research on the positive aspects of SCRMPs could be another reason for its low
adoption at the farm level. Few studies have documented crop residue burning, focusing
on the negative impacts or the expense of managing crop residues at the farm level [38,39].
For instance, Riaz and Hamid (2018) [22] highlighted that crop residue burning is now
restricted to a few places in Punjab province, but if it continues, it will spread across all the
plain areas of Pakistan. Mendoza (2015) [40] also suggested that recycling crop residues in
the landscape of the Philippines would be an excellent approach to reducing the country’s
reliance on imported fertilizers while simultaneously helping to combat climate change.
Moreover, little research has been conducted on exploring the nexuses between the positive
aspects of adopting SCRMPs and their impact on human health [41,42]. Therefore, further
research is needed to explore the beneﬁts of SCRMPs and the underlying factors and
constraints that prevail at the local level.
Given the aforementioned research gap, this study will provide better insight into
farmers’ adoption of SCRMPs and their impact on human health. Precisely, this paper
addresses four important research questions: First, how do farmers respond to SCRMPs?
Second, how does the adoption of SCRMPs differ among farmers? Third, what factors
sway farmers’ decisions to implement SCRMPs? Fourth, what impact does the adoption of
SCRMPs have on human health costs?
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Area
Punjab is the primary focus of this research since it produces 74 percent of the country’s
cereal and contributes 53 percent of the country’s agricultural GDP. The major crops
cultivated here are wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, cotton and pulses [43,44]. In Punjab, ﬁve
agro-climatic zones, namely wheat–rice zone, cotton–wheat zone, mixed cropping zone,
barani (arid) zone, and low crop intensity zone, exist [45,46]. The rice-wheat cropping
zone is very important, as rice is the most important crop in the kharif season (starts
from June and ends in October). As reported by different studies, the majority of cropInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753

residue is managed through open ﬁeld burning, and the remainder is utilized for domestic
cooking [47,48]. Moreover, in the mixed cropping zone rice-wheat sugarcane is cultivated
and the majority of the residue is managed through burning [39,49]. Consequently, this
province is also responsible for widespread crop residue burning, which has resulted in
severe health and environmental consequences. We compute the variation in different
crop residue practices. This study was mainly conducted in three districts selected from
the rice–wheat zone (Gujranwala district), mixed cropping zone (Faisalabad district), and
cotton–wheat zone (Rahim Yar Khan). A map of the research area and selected districts is
shown in Figure 1.

agro-climatic zones, namely wheat–rice zone, cotton–wheat zone, mixed cropping zone, 
barani (arid) zone, and low crop intensity zone, exist [45,46]. The rice-wheat cropping 
zone is very important, as rice is the most important crop in the kharif season (starts from 
June and ends in October). As reported by different studies, the majority of crop residue 
is managed through open field burning, and the remainder is utilized for domestic cook-
ing [47,48]. Moreover, in the mixed cropping zone rice-wheat sugarcane is cultivated and 
the majority of the residue is managed through burning [39,49]. Consequently, this prov-
ince is also responsible for widespread crop residue burning, which has resulted in severe 
health and environmental consequences. We compute the variation in different crop resi-
due practices. This study was mainly conducted in three districts selected from the rice–
wheat zone (Gujranwala district), mixed cropping zone (Faisalabad district), and cotton–
wheat zone (Rahim Yar Khan). A map of the research area and selected districts is shown 
in Figure 1.

2.2. Data Source 
For this study, cross-section data were collected from selected districts using struc-
tured questionnaires from February to March 2018. A multi-stage sampling technique 
(District→Tehsil→Union council→Villages→Respondents) was used to select approxi-
mately 420 farmers for face-to-face interviews (Figure 2). The purposive sampling tech-
nique was used in the selection of Punjab province (first stage) and representative agro-
climatic zones (second stage). Random sampling was used in the selection of representa-
tive districts (third stage) from each agro-climatic zone. From each district, two sub-dis-
tricts (tehsils) (fourth stage) and 15 villages (fifth stage) were selected through a systematic 
random sampling technique. Finally, a simple random sampling technique was used in 
the selection of 4–5 farmers (sixth stage) from each village. In short, two tehsils were se-
lected from each district, 5 union council from each tehsil, 3 villages from each union 
council, and 4–5 farmers from each village. A representative sample was determined by 
considering various aspects such as demographic, socio-economic, and geography pro-
files of the households in the study areas of three agro-ecological zones. Various indicators 
used in the current study were primarily based on the authors’ own understanding of the 
study location, along with following peers and the published literature [50,51]. Respond-
ents’ responses were verified from key informant interviews before the final field obser-
vation. For this purpose, a list of farmers was acquired from the respective agriculture 
department. For the data collection, enumerators were hired from an agriculture univer-
sity and trained. One interview took, on average, 30–40 min due to the low literacy rate of 
the respondents and to ensure the precision of the collected data. A total of 25 farmers 
refused or did not participate in the survey due to a lack of understanding. A protocol

2.3. Conceptual and Analytical Framework 
Sustainable agriculture production is inevitable due to rapid urbanization, the mass 
spread of modern technologies, and the extensive use of inputs in order to ensure eco-
nomic growth. This immense pressure has led to the intensification of agriculture, with 
farmers often engaging in unsustainable practices, resulting in a slew of environmental 
pollution. It is too simplistic to assume that unprecedented agriculture pollution would 
minimize by promoting sustainable/eco-friendly agricultural practices [52,53]. So, it is 
necessary to understand the concept of SCRMPs in order to ensure the best outcome from 
any promotional or awareness campaigns. The conceptual framework of this study con-
sists of three parts, as shown in Figure 3: environmental and health vulnerabilities, the 
adoption mechanism, and overall adoption impact. The relationship between environ-
mental vulnerabilities, the adoption process, and human health is depicted using straight 
and dotted lines. The negative consequences such as increased healthcare costs and poor 
environmental quality are depicted in particular by dotted lines.

terestingly, the authors of [22,54] reported many environmental and health vulnerabilities
from the big cities of Punjab, Pakistan, and linked these with residue burning. Additionally,
extreme temperatures, heatwaves, and hazardous smog have been observed in Pakistan’s
south to central regions in recent years [24]. It can potentially harm farmers’ health and
production and their overall well-being. Poor health can have a negative impact on labor
productivity and thereby affect farmers’ well-being. However, if farmers adopt SCRMPs, it
will improve their health and positively impact productivity. In short, continual residue
burning would result in low crop production and detrimental effect on the environment
and health. This study aims to test the interactions, as explained above, and hypotheses.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753

2.3.1. Adoption Decision
In the context of the current investigation, the adoption of SCRMPs is deﬁned as a
preventive measure to offset losses caused by poor air quality, smog, and pollution. A
farmer is considered an adopter if he does not burn crop residues and instead employs
sustainable residue management measures; if he burns the residues, he is regarded as
a non-adopter.
Following Kato et al. (2011) [55], we used a random utility framework to represent
farmer adaptation decisions. Here, we assumed that ith farmer would choose to adopt
sustainable residue management practices only if he expected less expenditure on health
issues and is curious about environmental pollution or anticipated beneﬁts from adoption.
The adoption beneﬁts may reduce the monetary losses and improve the local environment
and health of farm households. This disparity in beneﬁts can be expressed using a latent
variable:
 U∗
i

:
U∗
i = βZik + µi
(1)
where Zik is the k explanatory variables’ vector, β is the logistic regression coefﬁcients
vector and µi is the error term. As the latent variable
 U∗
i

is unobservable, we have only:
Ui=
 1, U∗
i > 0
0, U∗
i ≤0
(2)
where Ui indicates that the ith farmer will adopt sustainable residue management practices
(Ui = 1) only if the cost of medication reduces from stopping the burning of residue
(U∗
i > 1). In contrast, ith farmer will not adapt the SCRMPs (Ui = 0) if they do not take in
to count positive net beneﬁts (U∗
i ≤0).
The adaptation of SCRMPs could help save on the cost of medication and improve
farmers’ health and the quality of the regional environment. It can be hard to differen-
tiate between adopters and non-adopters regarding health quality. If experimental data
are collected using randomization and counterfactual scenarios, it will be pretty easy to
distinguish between adopters and non-adopters. So, there is no counterfactual evidence
available in our cross-sectional data; the direct impact of adaptation can be measured by
looking at the differences in outcomes between adopters and non-adopters. However, this
may lead to inaccurate and biased estimates. The phenomenon of self-selection bias is
critical in assessing the net effect of the adaptation on health costs. Let us assume a reduced
form ordinary least square (OLS) equation that represents the relationship between the
adaptation and performance variables as we consider the value of self-selection bias:
Yij = λZik + ψUi + εi
(3)
where Zik is the vector of the output variable such as the health cost for the ith farmer
and εi is the error term, similar to Equation (1); Zik represents the independent variables’
vector and is the regression coefﬁcient. It might be possible that the decision to adopt (Ui),
which is assumed to be independent in the above equation, Equation (3), may be inﬂuenced
by some unobservable factors, e.g., knowledge, perception, or farmers’ skills, which are
already part of the error term (εi) of Equation (3). In other words, the error term (εi) of
Equation (3) may be correlated with the error term (µi) of Equation (1), and the resulting
selection bias may yield biased estimates [55]. There are many methods in the literature
that have been adopted to overcome this problem, such as the Heckman two-step method
and instrumental variables (IV) approach. In this procedure, at least one variable in the
treatment equation must serve as an instrument for the determination of the outcome
equation. In short, ﬁnding a valid instrument is a challenge [56]. Furthermore, the OLS
and IV procedures constrain the model to have a linear functional form, meaning that the
treatment and control variable coefﬁcients are identical.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753
6 of 19
2.3.2. Propensity Score Matching
We used Propensity score matching (PSM), a widely adopted approach for dealing
with the issue of selection bias [57–59]. The impact on the overall health costs of SCRMPs on
treatment (adopters) and control (non-adopters) groups was assessed by using the PSM. The
PSM method consists of two stages. First, to approximate propensity score matching, the
dependent variable (adoption of sustainable residue management practices and burning)
was regressed against the various independent variables using logistic regression. Second,
the nearest neighbor matching (NNM) was used to compare the two groups of farmers by
using their propensity score determined in the ﬁrst stage [60]. This method of matching
treatment (adopters) and control (non-adopters) groups allowed us to exclude the impact
of observable variables on the outcome variable (healthcare costs) [61].
2.3.3. Sensitivity Analysis
PSM’s main goal is to stabilize the measured distribution of covariates across classes
of adapters and non-adopters [62]. There’s a risk that any unexplained variables may
simultaneously inﬂuence the adaptation decision and the outcome variable. Moreover,
latent bias and matching estimates may cause a robustness problem [63]. As a result, after
matching, we performed a series of model adequacy tests to ensure that the distribution of
covariates between the two groups was consistent. For instance, available indicators such
as pseudo R2, F-statistics, and standardized mean differences before and after matching
were calculated.
3. Results and Discussions
3.1. Descriptive Statistics
The results of descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. According to these, 51% of
farmers do not burn crop residues after harvesting and instead use sustainable crop residue
management practices. The results revealed that almost half of the respondents are aged
between 30 and 50 years. Additionally, around 30% were 50 years old. Those farmers aged
30 years old accounted for 22% of the total sample. Likewise, half of the farmers have less
than 20 years farming experience. Education wise, almost half of the respondents only
received a primary education, whereas only 20% of the respondents have an elementary
or high school level education. The majority of the farmers are small landholders and
have land up to 4 acres. More than 32% of farmers have a farm size of between 5 and
12 acres. The farmers cultivating the land of more than 12 acres were considered to be large
farmers. Around 30% of farmers have an annual income that is less than 250,000 Pak Rupees
(PKR), while 33.8% earn between PKR 250,000 and 50,0000, and 43.3% earn more than
PKR 500,000 and above. The results also show that farmers do not have enough income or
wealth to access the necessary equipment to adopt sustainable crop waste management
practices. Farmers in study areas have limited access to farm machinery. Only 24.5% of
the farmers have access to tractor trollies and other farm implements such as disc ploughs,
rotavators, and threshers. This study’s results align with those of [64,65], which revealed
that farmers had higher ages, lower education levels, and limited availability of resources
in developing countries. Further, limited access to farm machinery and tool may be an
essential determinant of the non-adoption of sustainable crop residue management.

3.2. Health Impacts and Health Costs of Crop Residue Burning
It is acknowledged that signiﬁcant crop residue burning can negatively affect local
communities [66]. However, to explore these negative health impacts and associated costs,
we asked households to recall what kind of health issues they or their family face during
the burning of crop residues season. The signiﬁcant adverse health impacts reported by
farm households include coughing (45%), eye irritation (33%), headache (31%), nausea
(29%), skin irritation (23%), and respiratory allergies (22%) (Table 2). Blurred vision,
bronchial infection, dizziness, asthma, and fatigue are other minor side effects. Respiratory
allergies are directly connected with air pollution. Further, the severity of the disease
also depends on temperatures and the dispersion of plumes from burning. These results
are consistent with previous reports and studies that have found a variety of negative
consequences for households due to crop residue burning [67–69]. Cheng et al. (2011), [70]
also found that agricultural crop residue burning contributes to adverse health effects in
indoor and outdoor environments, such as cardiac and respiratory morbidity and mortality.
Moreover, 7350–16,200 premature deaths and 6.0 million asthma attacks/year were reported
in Delhi due to increased emissions from crop residue burning in the north-western part of
India [71].Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753

Some respondents reported more than one health impact, so the percentage would not be equal to 100.
Further, we found that the intensity of negative impacts varies across study districts
depending upon the intensity of crop residue burning. For instance, most households in
Gujranwala, where rice burning is a huge problem, reported more negative impacts than
other districts. Gujranwala is one of the leading cities in rice production due to easy access
to water resources. Resultantly, more residual is produced. Due to ease, farmers burn the
crop residue to get rid of it, contributing highly to GHG emissions. Therefore, Gujranwala is
an environmental vulnerability city in Punjab district, Pakistan. Crop burning activity has
been increased due to the lack of storage facilities, and market opportunities also drive the
farmers to burn crop residues [72]. Table 3 demonstrates the perception of the respondents
regarding crop residue burning intensity and its impact on health.

Further, we also explored other indirect or non-health-related impacts of crop residue
burning (Table 4). Many respondents reported that crop residue burning directly affects
their work productivity as they fall ill due to heavy smoke at the workplace. Furthermore,
many farmers claimed that the smoke generated by burning caused smog and caused
accidents on major highways. Farmers in Gujranwala and Rahim Yar Khan, in particular,
have noticed this phenomenon. Crop residue burning has resulted in the deaths of some
people in serious situations, either as a result of accidents or health problems.

3.3. Health Cost Due to Crop Residue Burning
Further, we estimated the economic value of health damages caused due to crop
residue burning. In chronic cases, exposure to a high level of air pollution may cause
permanent health injuries such as the development of lung diseases such as asthma, Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), bronchitis, lung capacity loss, and emphysema,Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753
9 of 19
cancer, etc. [71]. For this purpose, we acquired information about the number of visits to the
hospital or clinic for each case and asked for information on different aspects of each visit,
including the cost of medication, traveling/transportation, self-treatment, and preventive
measures (Table 5). In the end, we calculated the total health cost for each health impact.
The present study estimates health costs due to burning crop residue among households.
The results revealed that the total medication cost on average for chronic diseases is USD
13.37, and for non-chronic illnesses, USD 8.79. The cost of preventive measures is very low
among the farmers.

Moreover, farmers rely on self-treatment, which deteriorates the efforts to curb the
burning of residues. The medication cost and traveling are also a cause of the increase
in the expenses. Especially, the availability and access to specialized health facilities are
not enough in Punjab’s rural areas. People also use domestic methods, which are also
very cheap. However, adopting preventive measures during burning days is also not very
common. Farmers are responsible for making management decisions that will optimize
crop yields and minimize environmental impacts.
3.4. Farm Level Adoption of SCRMPs
We assessed actual adoption in the study districts to evaluate farmers’ current un-
derstanding of sustainable residue management practices and the farm-level adaptation
mechanism. According to the ﬁndings, farmers in three research districts used various
methods to treat crop residue (Figure 4). The decomposition of crop residues has both
positive and negative impacts on crop production. Therefore, the farmer should adopt
practices that have a maximum positive effect on the environment and minimum negative
effect on human health and the environment. For example, soil management with crop
residues covers a wide range of aspects, such as residue decomposition, soil erosion control,
nutrient recycling and availability to plants, and various conservation practices related to
tillage for maximizing crop yields. So, if accurate knowledge about sustainable adoption
of crop management practices provides to farmers, they are willing to adopt SCRMPs. It
is well known that the sustainable management of crop resides can efﬁciently improve
the soil chemical properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity
(CEC), and the transformation of different primary and secondary plant nutrients. So, there
is need to provide this important information to farmers.
The use of crop residue as livestock feed was the key sustainable crop residue strategy
adopted by more than half of the farmers. The results imply that feed crop residual to
livestock does not break the cycle of nutrient and biomass return to the soil since these
can be returned in manure, which improves soil fertility. Therefore, sustainable livestock
feed is necessary for optimal use of crop residue. Other measures include on-farm use,
residue retention, and bio-fertilization. In the study area, most farmers are smallholders
and often rear livestock to manage their livelihood. Therefore, they often use crop residue
as a source of animal feed. For this purpose, they collect and store residue in one place.
Mostly, farmers keep residue in the open ﬁeld due to the non-availability of a warehouse or
appropriate storage place.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753

trol, nutrient recycling and availability to plants, and various conservation practices re
lated to tillage for maximizing crop yields. So, if accurate knowledge about sustainable 
adoption of crop management practices provides to farmers, they are willing to adopt 
SCRMPs. It is well known that the sustainable management of crop resides can efficiently 
improve the soil chemical properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange 
capacity (CEC), and the transformation of different primary and secondary plant nutri-
ents. So, there is need to provide this important information to farmers.

Mostly, farmers keep residue in the open field due to the non-availability of a warehouse 
or appropriate storage place. 
Figure 4. Farmers’ residue management practices in three Punjab districts.
Further, farmers often use crop residue for bedding and shelter for their livestock. It
is done mainly in winter to give comfort to milking animals. Farmers reported that this
practice has resulted in a positive impact on the quality and quantity of milk. Furthermore,
some farmers in the study districts use the residue retention technique. Farmers in Gujran-
wala, for example, have implemented a residue retention policy to use crop residues to
enhance soil and water quality. This strategy would be beneﬁcial in terms of agronomical
and economically. These factors would lead to signiﬁcant advantages (i.e., reducing costs
of fertilizers and water). Makkar (2016) [73] explored that using crop residue for livestock
feed would help to improve the three traditional sustainability pillars (economic, envi-
ronmental and social). Similarly, [74–76] also reported that adopting the residue retention
technique and conservation agriculture improves soil health nutrients ratio and increases
water conservation in the ﬁeld.
In addition to positively impacting sustainable residue management practices, the
adoption rate is still very low due to various constraints, even though sustainable crop
residual management improves the fertility and productivity of the soil. We further ex-
plored farmers’ key hurdles and limitations restricting them from adopting sustainable
crop residue management practices. According to the study ﬁndings, the saving cost of
residue management, restrictive application time, limited knowledge, lack of training in
advanced technologies, and limited ﬁnancial capacity are critical reasons for low adoption
(Figure 5). Many other studies, e.g., [76,77], have also identiﬁed the current policies, ﬁnan-
cial constraints, etc., low education level restricts farmers from adopting these practices.
So results imply that landholding should increase to achieve the optimal beneﬁts from
sustainable crop residue management. Small landholding farmers should have proper
access to credit and fertilizer facilities. Education and lack of proper training are the main
barriers to optimal crop residue use.
We also examined how crop residue management practices were adopted by different
farmers based on their level of education, age, and landholding scale (see Figure 6). Farmers
were classiﬁed into three groups based on their level of education: (1) farmers who are
illiterate or have had less than 5 years of schooling; (2) farmers who have had 5 to 10 years
of schooling; and (3) farmers who have had more than 10 years of schooling. Farmers were
also classiﬁed into three age groups: (1) those under the age of 25, (2) those between the
ages of 26 and 50, and (3) those over 50. Farmers were classiﬁed into three groups based on
the size of their farms: (1) small-scale farmers with up to 5 acres of land, (2) medium-scale
farmers with 6 to 12 acres of land, and (3) large-scale farmers with more than 12 acres
of land.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753

advanced technologies, and limited financial capacity are critical reasons for low adoption 
(Figure 5). Many other studies, e.g., [76,77], have also identified the current policies, fi-
nancial constraints, etc., low education level restricts farmers from adopting these prac-
tices. So results imply that landholding should increase to achieve the optimal benefits 
from sustainable crop residue management. Small landholding farmers should have 
proper access to credit and fertilizer facilities. Education and lack of proper training are 
the main barriers to optimal crop residue use.

between the ages of 26 and 50, and (3) those over 50. Farmers were classified into three 
groups based on the size of their farms: (1) small-scale farmers with up to 5 acres of land, 
(2) medium-scale farmers with 6 to 12 acres of land, and (3) large-scale farmers with more 
than 12 acres of land. 
 
Figure 6. Relationship between adaptation and socio-demographic properties. 
The results in Figure 6 show a positive association of adoption decisions with educa-
tion level. About 68% of the farmers with higher education do not burn their crop residues 
and use sustainable residue management practices. Of the farmers with 5–10 years of ed-
ucation, only 48% adopted other practices. Similar positive associations of this behavior 
with education level were reported by [74,78]. Furthermore, Figure 6 revealed that farm-
ers with a higher education adopted these practices than less educated farmers. Likewise, 
the adoption rate among the young farmers is also high compared to the old farmers. 
These findings are consistent with the findings of [78–80], who found a positive relation-
ship between education level and sustainable crop residue use. The proportion of adop-
tion among young and middle-aged farmers is around 82–50% compared to old-age farm-
ers. The share of farmers with landholding up to 5 acres is 42%, but the large-scale farmer’s 
rate was almost 60%. These findings indicate that large-scale farmers were less con-
strained in implementing residue management practices. These findings are consistent 
with previous research, e.g., [78,80], which found a connection between landholding and 
the adoption of sustainable residue management practices.

research, e.g., [78,80], which found a connection between landholding and the adoption of
sustainable residue management practices.
3.5. Knowledge, Understanding, and Sustainable Residue Management Activities
In the next step, we explored the level of awareness and knowledge about the haz-
ardous impact of crop residue burning among adopters and non-adopters. We found that
the level of knowledge and awareness was higher in the case of adopters as compared to
non-adopters. This implies that awareness about negative impacts plays an important role
in deciding between the adoption of crop residue practices. Furthermore, we discovered
that farmers who were aware of various alternative or beneﬁcial aspects of sustainable crop
residue management practices were more likely to follow them.
Knowledge of the hazardous impact of burning crop residue on health was explored.
Further, we asked about the households who suffered any illness because of the residue
burning. We categorized the farmers into two categories, those who do not burn the crop
residues are the adopters, and the others are non-adopters. Mostly, non-adopters know
that burning cause hazardous health impact. Likewise, burning also induced illness among
households during the harvesting season (Table 6). The number of adopters is higher than
non-adopters. This result implies the lack of information about damages associated with
crop residue burning. Most adopters know about sustainable crop reside management,
such as livestock feed, reside used as a shelter for livestock, etc., so they optimally use it
rather than burning it. The results can also be related to their ﬁnancial condition. They are
holding small land, so the residue produced is used for livestock to avoid the extra cost of
feeding their livestock.

We analyzed the farm-level adaptation measures across different categories of farmers,
i.e., the farm size and their educational level. The farm size of adapters also positively
impacts farmers’ adaptation for residual crop management. The results are consistent with
those of [81,82]. Education has been identiﬁed as an important component of implementing
sustainable agricultural residue management strategies [83,84]. The results imply that an
increase in education increases the likelihood of implementing sustainable crop residue
management practices. Educated farmers adapted more compared to less educated farmers.
These results are consistent with other research ﬁndings, conﬁrming that the number of
years of schooling plays a vital role in pushing humans to make economically sustainable
and environmentally health-conscious decisions [85,86].
We found inconclusive results regarding the relationship between age and the adoption
of new practices among farmers. The variable for the farm household’s age, on the other
hand, is negatively but insigniﬁcantly correlated with adoption decisions. This ﬁnding may
be attributed to the predicted opposite impact of age on the likelihood of implementing
management activities that operate across the decision-networks maker’s and planning
horizon [77,87]. The results may imply that people with a higher age bracket are less
indulged in adoption practices. Similarly, income has no signiﬁcant impact on farmers’
decisions to follow sustainable crop residue management practices.
Tube well ownership does signiﬁcantly affect the farmer’s decision to adopt sustain-
able residue management practices. This is true because the easy availability of water at
farms makes farmers ﬂexible in making decisions on harvesting and sowing crops. This
ﬂexibility also allows them to manage harvest and crop residue effectively and easily.
The rotavator ownership reduces the probability of adoption, possibly reﬂecting that
those households used this instrument for commercial purposes and less need to use it for
their purpose. Further, variables related to farm machinery and implements such as tractor
trollies and disc ploughs are signiﬁcantly related to the adoption decision, implying that
farmers having easy access to farm machinery can easily adjust their sowing and harvesting
timing, allowing them to manage their crop residues in a better way.
Furthermore, having a tractor trolley is a key component in using agricultural residue
responsibly, as farmers sometimes have difﬁculty transferring their residue to other loca-
tions. As a result of the lack of adequate transportation or cost of the transportation, they
may be inﬂuenced to burn crop residue as a convenient and cost-effective technique. The
results are in line with other study, e.g., [64].
The results imply that access to extension services and canal water information may
positively impact the farmers’ adaptation decision. Access to extension services and canal
water information has positive coefﬁcients and tends to expedite anti-burning sustainable
management practices. These ﬁndings proved our assumption before the analysis and
aligned with the other studies’ results, e.g., [72,88].
In the case of residue management activities, however, the negative coefﬁcient of the
weather forecasting variable indicates that farmers could not relate their decision behaviorInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 4753
14 of 19
to the weather situation. This result also depicts the poor weather forecast facilities available
to the farmer. This region is not rich in technological innovations; therefore, farmers
cannot adopt residual management practices. The results also imply that most of the
adapters use weather forecasting information from different sources to adjust management
options, which may not be accurate due to differences in weather conditions in these three
regions. Each region has different weather conditions, negatively impacting overall crop
residual management. These ﬁndings are not consistent with the results of other studies,
e.g., [81,87,89].
The results for regional dummies are partially consistent with a previous study [51,90,91].
Furthermore, the negative coefﬁcients for regional dummies imply that farmers in both
districts (Gujranwala and Faisalabad) were less likely to adapt residual waste management
practices than the Rahim Yar Khan district farmers. This may be because farmers in
Rahim Yar Khan are more concerned with health and the environment or do not have any
awareness/knowledge about the adverse effects of residual burning.
3.6.2. Impact of Sustainable Crop Residue Management Practices on Health Costs
It is understood that adopting sustainable crop residue management practices may
generally reduce health costs in the areas where farmers do not burn crop residues. We
calculated the casual impact of adopting sustainable residue management practices on
health costs to test this hypothesis. For this purpose, ﬁrst propensity scores were calcu-
lated using logistic regression. After calculating the propensity scores based on identical
propensity scores, the nearest neighbor matching approach was used to align adopters
(treatment group) and non-adopters (control group). The nearest neighboring method
(NNM) discarded non-adopters during the matching process, resulting in a substantial
reduction in the total sample size from 420 to 214 for post-matching effect analysis.
The post-matching results are presented in Table 8, which reveals that the adoption of
sustainable crop residue management practices signiﬁcantly reduces the health cost. Here,
the ATE shows the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) for all without matching and correcting
the biases. In contrast, ATT shows the average treatment effect for treated, i.e., the impact
after matching and correcting the biases. The results showed that the overall impact of
sustainable crop residue management practices (ATE) without correcting biases was more
(PKR 897) than the impact calculated after correcting the biases. The value of ATT (PKR
312) shows that adopting sustainable crop residue management practices will reduce the
health cost by PKR 312 per season.

Further, the results of sensitivity analysis presented in Table 9 also conﬁrm the ad-

standard differences, indicating reduced biases. Overall, more than 55% of business has
been reduced through the matching process. The impact of health costs is only determined
by the adoption of sustainable crop residue management practices.

4. Conclusions
Agricultural crop residue burning has emerged as an essential challenge in the agricul-
tural production system because of rising air pollution episodes, the release of short-lived
climate pollutants, and declining soil health. Crop residual burning negatively affects the
health and environment of rural livelihoods in Pakistan adversely. Thus, timely adaptation
is desirable to reduce potential losses at the farm level. This case study analyzed farmers
from rural Pakistan and provided insights into their adaptation to residual management
determinants. This study reveals the extent to which farmers perceive residue as a problem
and adapt their residual management practices accordingly.
The results of our study revealed that adopting sustainable crop residue manage-
ment is considered the best alternative to prevent the burning’s hazardous impact on the
ecosystem. However, farmers end up with higher costs in terms of medication expenses
due to facing health issues because of the burning. Likewise, a loss of working hours and
medication costs are signiﬁcant contributors to the losses.
The cost reduction shows the effective approach to tackle the expenses. Moreover,
results also revealed that adopting sustainable crop residue management practices helped
reduce the expenses due to health issues. This study also conﬁrms that sustainable utiliza-
tion of crop residues can improve households’ health status and help reduce the ﬁnancial
burden. Overall, this study proved and reckons that the sustainable utilization of crop
residue is beneﬁcial in curbing the hazardous impact of residue burning on the environment.
However, farmers are still not well aware of these beneﬁts due to the numerous constraints.
This implies that large-scale awareness campaigns in both rural and urban areas
should be created. Government agencies’ positions are crucial to this campaign’s success.
Focus group awareness, workshops, and community mobilization activities are highly
feasible choices. Similarly, capacity building of extension workers and local stakeholders
could also help enhance the sustainable management of crop residues. Research institutes,
government agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and the private sector
can signiﬁcantly remove these constraints through the vibrant collaboration for capacity
building and dissemination of innovative practices among farmers.
Furthermore, policies should be updated based on on-the-ground research and small
farmers, who account for more than two-thirds of Pakistan’s total farmer population. Both
of these measures will help to alleviate the negative effects of climate change and can
aid farmers in improving their well-being and ensuring better health. In addition, they
will help to minimize the negative impacts of crop residue burning. In this regard, the
interventions from the circular bioeconomy involve the recirculation of material ﬂows and
the adoption of the restoration cycle.
This study used cross sectional data to explore the nexuses between the positive aspects
of adopting SCRMPs and their impact on human health. Nevertheless, there are numerous
limitations worth mentioning. First, this study concerns the elicitation responses related to
health impacts and burning instead of scientiﬁc data. Secondly, research is necessary for
improvements and was validated with satellite-based ﬁre count data. Furthermore, it can
be extended by estimating the GHGs emission load due to crop residue burning activity
over said regions during the burning months to assess its impact on health. It also helps
to widen the scope of the study and make it more comprehensive that encompassing the
problem well.

Summary
Background 3 billion people worldwide rely on polluting fuels and technologies for domestic cooking and heating. 
We estimate the global, regional, and national health burden associated with exposure to household air pollution.
Methods For the systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched four databases for studies published 
from database inception to April 2, 2020, that evaluated the risk of adverse cardiorespiratory, paediatric, and maternal 
outcomes from exposure to household air pollution, compared with no exposure. We used a random-effects model to 
calculate disease-specific relative risk (RR) meta-estimates. Household air pollution exposure was defined as use of 
polluting fuels (coal, wood, charcoal, agricultural wastes, animal dung, or kerosene) for household cooking or 
heating. Temporal trends in mortality and disease burden associated with household air pollution, as measured by 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), were estimated from 2000 to 2017 using exposure prevalence data from 183 of 
193 UN member states. 95% CIs were estimated by propagating uncertainty from the RR meta-estimates, prevalence 
of household air pollution exposure, and disease-specific mortality and burden estimates using a simulation-based 
approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019125060.
Findings 476 studies (15·5 million participants) from 123 nations (99 [80%] of which were classified as low-income and 
middle-income) met the inclusion criteria. Household air pollution was positively associated with asthma (RR 1·23, 
95% CI 1·11–1·36), acute respiratory infection in both adults (1·53, 1·22–1·93) and children (1·39, 1·29–1·49), chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (1·70, 1·47–1·97), lung cancer (1·69, 1·44–1·98), and tuberculosis (1·26, 1·08–1·48); 
cerebrovascular disease (1·09, 1·04–1·14) and ischaemic heart disease (1·10, 1·09–1·11); and low birthweight (1·36, 
1·19–1·55) and stillbirth (1·22, 1·06–1·41); as well as with under-5 (1·25, 1·18–1·33), respiratory (1·19, 1·18–1·20), and 
cardiovascular (1·07, 1·04–1·11) mortality. Household air pollution was associated with 1·8 million (95% CI 1·1–2·7) 
deaths and 60·9 million (34·6–93·3) DALYs in 2017, with the burden overwhelmingly experienced in low-income and 
middle-income countries (LMICs; 60·8 million [34·6–92·9] DALYs) compared with high-income countries 
(0·09 million [0·01–0·40] DALYs). From 2000, mortality associated with household air pollution had reduced by 
36% (95% CI 29–43) and disease burden by 30% (25–36), with the greatest reductions observed in higher-income 
nations.
Interpretation The burden of cardiorespiratory, paediatric, and maternal diseases associated with household air 
pollution has declined worldwide but remains high in the world’s poorest regions. Urgent integrated health and 
energy strategies are needed to reduce the adverse health impact of household air pollution, especially in LMICs.

Introduction
WHO estimates that almost 3 billion people worldwide 
rely on polluting fuels such as wood, coal, crop waste, 
animal dung, or charcoal paired with inefficient stoves 
for cooking and heating.1 These fuels burn inefficiently, 
emitting high concentrations of both gaseous and 
particulate pollutants within households.2 There is now 
considerable evidence linking household air pollution 
to a broad range of cardiorespiratory,3–5 paediatric,6 and 
maternal6 conditions, with these disease categories 
specifically highlighted by WHO.7 Exposure to household 
air pollution is among the top ten risk factors for disease, 
with the highest prevalence observed in the poorest com­
munities in low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs).8
Timely and accurate information is urgently needed to 
facilitate the development of effective global health 
strategies to curb the adverse health effects associated 
with household air pollution. Both WHO1 and the 
Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD)8 investigators 
have estimated mortality and morbidity attributable to 
household air pollution from cardiorespiratory diseases.

These estimates were primarily derived using compre­
hensive integrated exposure–response (IER) curves9,10 for 
particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2·5 μm 
(PM2·5) for each of the risk–outcome pairs. These IERs 
have been predominantly based on exposure studies 
evaluating ambient air pollution and smoking,11 with only 
one study evaluating PM2·5 concentration from household 
air pollution.12
In this impact assessment, we did a comprehensive 
systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the most 
up-to-date evidence on the adverse health outcomes 
associated with household air pollution. Using the 
counterfactual of no exposure to household polluting 
fuels and technologies, we estimated the global, regional, 
and national mortality and burden.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we did a 
systematic search of Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and the 
Global Health and Web of Science for studies evaluating 
the association between exposure to household air 
pollution and adverse cardiorespiratory, paediatric health 
outcomes, and maternal health out­comes. We included 
all studies of any design published from database 
inception to April 2, 2020. The full search strategy is 
included in the appendix (pp 4–8). We identified further 
studies through searches of bibliographies and references.
We included studies reporting risk of cardiovascular 
disease, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, 
asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
acute respiratory infection, lung cancer, active pulmonary 
tuberculosis, low birthweight, stillbirth, or all-cause 
mortality in people exposed to household air pollution. 
Household air pollution exposure was defined as use of 
polluting fuels (coal, wood, charcoal, agricultural wastes, 
animal dung, or kerosene) for household cooking or 
heating. All users of polluting fuels were assumed to be 
exposed to household air pollution because there are 
currently no scalable efficient stoves.7 Studies reporting 
relative risks (RRs) for outcomes per unit increment of 
indoor pollutant concentrations, risk in those exposed to 
gas cooking or heating compared with those unexposed, 
and evaluating the impact of improved cookstoves were 
also included. The study methodology, reporting, and 
presentation were done in accordance with current 
guidelines (appendix pp 4–8, 54–56).13
All studies identified were screened by two investigators 
and conflicts adjudicated by a third (KKL, RB, JK, SB, NS, 
DS, AB, SSJ, FS, ASVS). There were no age or language 
restrictions and only original peer-reviewed articles were 
included. Studies with the largest participant size were 
chosen where there were multiple articles from the same 
cohort. Studies that evaluated a composite of acute 
cardiovascular or respiratory events that included our 
outcomes of interest but were not exclusive to these 
conditions were also included. Where required, authors 
were contacted for additional data or clarification.
Prevalence of polluting fuel use and household air 
pollution associated burden
Annual prevalence estimates of polluting fuel use (based 
on national survey modelling) from 2000 to 2017 were 
provided for 183 of the 193 UN member states by WHO.14 
Annual disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and deaths 
due to cardiorespiratory, paediatric, and maternal out­
comes for 2000–17 were available from the Institute of 
Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for 195 countries 
and territories.15 For 2017, age-standardised national 
estimates of the number of deaths and DALYs were 
obtained for each of these outcomes per 100 000 pop­­
ulation. We classified each country according to the six 
WHO regions and World Bank income groups in 2018 
(appendix pp 56–60).

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Previous studies have estimated mortality and morbidity 
attributable to household air pollution. These estimates were 
derived using comprehensive integrated exposure–response 
functions that have been predominantly based on studies 
evaluating the risk of exposure to PM2·5 from ambient air 
pollution and smoking. 
Added value of this study
We did a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis 
to evaluate the most up-to-date evidence on the adverse health 
outcomes associated with household air pollution, and 
calculated the pooled meta-estimates for each cardiovascular, 
respiratory, paediatric, and maternal outcome. Using a 
counterfactual of no exposure, we then estimated the trend in 
global, regional, and national mortality and burden associated 
with household air pollution.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study highlights the urgent need for evidence-based policy 
making and decision making to reduce the substantial burden 
of disease associated with household air pollution, particularly 
in low-income and middle-income countries. Recent evidence 
suggests that cleaner-burning biomass-fuelled cookstoves do 
not deliver the expected health benefits; therefore, future 
clinical trials should evaluate the impact of cleaner fuel 
interventions on health outcomes.

adjudicated by a third (KKL, RB, JK, SB, NS, DS, AB, SSJ, 
FS, ASVS). We extracted RRs, 2 × 2 contingency tables, 
baseline characteristics of the study population, type of 
fuel or cookstove used in the exposed and comparator 
group, and detailed characteristics of the study design.
A step-by-step description of the analysis is detailed in 
the appendix (pp 10–13). In brief, RR meta-estimates for 
risk–outcome pairs were computed using a random-
effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² 
statistic. Significant heterogeneity was anticipated across 
the studies and normal probability plots were used to 
evaluate the distribution of the RRs (appendix pp 14–15). 
Age and sex interactions were evaluated for the risk of 
cardiorespiratory disease in adults associated with 
household air pollution. As interactions were absent or 
weak, we did not compute age-stratified or sex-stratified 
cause-specific RRs (appendix pp 10, 16–21). Risk of bias 
for each study was assessed on the method used for case 
ascertainment and the degree of confounder adjustment 
(appendix p 9). Sensitivity analyses of RRs were done for 
studies at low or moderate risk of bias, longitudinal 
studies, and studies where the comparator group was 
only clean fuel use (gas or electricity).
Using a simulation-based approach, we obtained 
10 000 samples from a log-normal distribution of the RR 
meta-estimates and a beta distribution of the prevalence of 
household air pollution exposure to calculate the cause-
specific population attributable fraction and 95% CIs 
(appendix pp 10–13).16 Using cause-specific and year-
specific DALY and mortality estimates from IHME and 
the population attributable fraction, we derived national 
estimates of disease burden and mortality associated with 
household air pollution, and combined these to derive 
global and regional estimates. Sensitivity analyses for 
disease burden were calculated from RRs restricted to 
studies where the comparator was specifically clean fuels 
and those at low or moderate risk of bias. All analyses 
were done in R (version 3.6.1). This study is registered 
with PROSPERO, CRD42019125060.

Results
Our search identified 60 629 studies, with 41 identified 
through other sources (appendix p 22). After duplicates 
were removed, titles and abstracts of 46 584 articles were 
screened, 1646 full-text articles were reviewed, and 
476 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis 
(appendix pp 22, 61–82). Of these, seven were randomised 
controlled trials, 75 were prospective cohort studies, 
139 were case-control studies, 16 were retrospective cohort 
studies, and 239 were cross-sectional studies. These 
studies included 15·5 million participants across 
123 countries, of which the majority (99 [80%] countries) 
were LMICs. 14 studies were excluded from the 
quantitative analysis owing to insufficient data.
267 articles provided 541 estimates to derive pooled 
RRs for respiratory diseases in people exposed to 
polluting fuels and technologies compared with those 
unexposed (figure 1). The pooled RRs showed increased 
risk of asthma, COPD, acute respiratory infection in 
adults and children, lung cancer, and pulmonary tuber­
culosis, with the highest RR for COPD (figure 1). Positive 
associations were also observed for ischaemic heart 
disease and cerebrovascular disease (figure 1).
19 articles provided 58 estimates for asthma or 
respiratory symptoms per unit increment in nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2) and PM2·5. Both NO2 (per 10 parts per 
billion) and PM2·5 (per 10 µg/m³) were associated with 
cough (1·03 [95% CI 1·00–1·05] and 1·01 [1·00–1·02], 
respectively) and dyspnoea (1·23 [1·06–1·38] and 1·01 
[1·00–1·01], respectively; appendix pp 41–42). Across 
31 studies, gas cooking or heating was associated with 
asthma (1·17 [1·07–1·29]; appendix p 35). 23 articles, 
including seven randomised controlled trials, reported

RRs of respiratory disease (0·59 [0·45–0·77] for acute 
respiratory infection and 0·69 [0·45–1·04] for asthma) or 
symptoms (0·67 [0·54–0·84]) in people using improved 
cookstoves compared with traditional stoves (appendix 
p 36). Of these, the largest randomised controlled trial in 
10 750 children did not show any reduction in acute 
respiratory infections.17
26 studies provided 46 estimates for adverse maternal 
outcomes (appendix p 30). The pooled RR was 1·36 
(95% CI 1·19–1·55) for low birthweight and 1·22 
(1·06–1·41) for stillbirth. Infants born to mothers exposed 
to polluting fuels and technologies were an average of 
149 g (95% CI 101–196) lighter at birth (appendix p 40).
35 studies provided 84 estimates for mortality in people 
exposed to polluting fuels and technologies. The pooled 
RR showed increased risk of under-5 mortality (figure 2). 
Exposure to polluting fuels and technologies also 
increased the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and all-
cause mortality (figure 2).
Forest plots for each of the individual endpoints are 
presented in the appendix (pp 23–42). Sensitivity analyses 
restricted to studies with low or moderate risk of bias, 
with a longitudinal design, and in which the comparator 
was specifically clean fuels attenuated the overall effect 
of some estimates, with the effect direction mostly 
remaining unchanged (appendix pp 43–46).
In 2017, household air pollution contributed to 
1·8 million (95% CI 1·1–2·7) deaths and 60·9 million 
(34·6–93·3) DALYs globally. Among these, respiratory 
disease was the leading cause of death and DALYs 
attributable to household air pollution accounted for 
38% of all deaths (0·7 million [0·4–1·0]) and 75% of all 
DALYs (45·7 million [26·8–68·8]; figure 3; appendix p 84). 
Communicable respiratory disease (acute respiratory 
infection and pulmonary tubercu­losis) accounted for 
most of the respiratory burden (27·4 million [16·4–41·0] 
DALYs), followed by chronic respiratory disease (18·4 mil­
lion [10·4–27·8] DALYs for asthma and COPD) and lung 
cancer (5·5 million [2·8–9·0] DALYs; appendix p 84). 
Cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease and 
cerebrovascular disease) accounted for 0·3 million 
(0·1–0·6) deaths and 9·5 million (5·0–15·6) DALYs.
In 2017, disease burden associated with household air 
pollution was almost exclusively concentrated in LMICs 
(60·8 million [95% CI 34·6–92·9] DALYs and 1·8 million 
[1·1–2·7] deaths vs 0·09 million [0·01–0·40] DALYs and 
0·002 million [0·000–0·009] deaths in high-income 
countries; appendix pp 47–49, 85). The South-East Asia 
region had the highest burden due to household air 
pollution with 23·3 million (13·7–34·4) DALYs and 
0·57 million (0·34–0·84) deaths, followed by the African 
region (18·3 million [11·8–26·2] DALYs and 0·72 million 
[0·51–0·97] deaths) and the Western Pacific region 
(14·2 million [6·4–23·6] DALYs and 0·33 million 
[0·14–0·57] deaths; figure 4; appendix pp 50, 86). The 
country with the highest burden was India (17·3 million 
[10·0–25·5] DALYs and 0·4 million [0·3–0·6] deaths) 
followed by China (11·7 million [5·0–19·6] DALYs and 
0·3 million [0·1–0·5] deaths) and Nigeria (5·0 million 
[3·4–7·1] DALYs and 0·2 million [0·1–0·3] deaths; 
appendix pp 48, 87–93). Countries in the African region 
had the highest age-standardised disease burden per 
100 000 population (figure 5; appendix pp 87–93).
Between 2000 and 2017, deaths and disease burden 
associated with household air pollution steadily reduced, 
by 36% (95% CI 29–43) and 30% (25–36), respectively 
(figure 3; appendix pp 49–50). The greatest relative 
reduction in DALYs occurred in the European region 
(71%) with the lowest reductions in the Western Pacific 
(21%) and African (22%) regions. India and China had

the greatest absolute reduction in DALYs from 2000 to 
2017 (8·0 million and 3·1 million, respectively; appendix 
p 86). DALYs attributable to household air pollution due 
to communicable respiratory disease reduced by 48% 
between 2000 and 2017 but increased by 27% for lung 
cancer and by 2% for ischaemic heart disease (appendix 
p 8).
Between 2000 and 2017, under-5 mortality attributable to 
household air pollution decreased by 50% from 1·6 million 
(95% CI 1·1–2·0) to 0·78 million (0·52–1·09) deaths 
(appendix p 51). Despite this reduction, under-5 mortality 
accounted for more than a third of all deaths associated 
with household air pollution in 2017, with most occurring 
in LMICs within the African (0·50 million [0·35–0·68]) 
and South-East Asia (0·16 million [0·10–0·23]) regions.
In our sensitivity analysis, using pooled RRs from 
studies where the comparator was clean fuel use, the 
estimated global burden associated with household air 
pollution was reduced to 49·1 million (95% CI 13·7–92·0) 
DALYs (appendix p 52). Using the pooled RRs from 
studies assessed to be at low or moderate risk of bias, the 
global burden estimate was 58·7 million (95% CI 
21·2–101·9) DALYs (appendix p 53).
Discussion
In this impact assessment evaluating the adverse health 
effects of household air pollution, we report several 
important observations. First, household air pollution is 
associated with an increased risk of adverse health 
effects, with the strongest association observed for 
respiratory diseases such as COPD and lung cancer. 
Second, in 2017, household air pollution was associated 
with 1·8 million deaths and 60·9 million DALYs 
globally. Third, under-5 mortality attributable to house­
hold air pollution halved between 2000 and 2017 but still 
accounted for more than a third of all deaths associated 
with household air pollution, the majority of which 
occurred in the African region. Fourth, burden associated 
with household air pollution has reduced by a third since 
2000. Burden of communicable diseases associated with 
household air pollution, including acute respiratory 
infection and tuberculosis, has nearly halved but has 
increased for lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease. 
Finally, there was clear geographical variation, with the 
overwhelming majority of burden associated with house­
hold air pollution seen in LMICs.
Our global burden estimates lie between those 
previously reported by WHO (3·8 million deaths in 2016)1 
and GBD (1·6 million deaths in 2017),18 which probably 
reflects the different methodological approaches taken. 
The WHO and GBD approaches used two components to 
estimate the burden: disease-specific IER functions and 
sex-specific and children-specific estimates of PM2·5 
exposure from household air pollution.9,11 Comprehensive 
modelling approaches were employed to derive the IER 
functions for PM2·5 concentration.9 RRs for household air 
pollution exposure were then derived from the outcome-
specific IER functions comparing the risk from estimated 
household PM2·5 exposures against a “counterfactual low 
PM2·5 concentration”, based on expert consensus.9,11,19 The 
IER functions were derived from studies primarily 
originating from high-income nations that evaluated 
exposure to ambient air pollution and smoking.9 PM2·5 
exposure estimates due to household air pollution were 
initially derived from households in India and subse­
quently from studies in the WHO Global Household Air 
Pollution database.20,21 By contrast, our methodology 
derived RRs for each risk–outcome pair using studies that 
have defined polluting fuel use as a binary indicator for 
exposure. Our review identified more than 400 studies, 
with only a fraction (n=24) measuring personal exposure 
concentrations. Consistent with the body of published 
literature, our study evaluated the risk for each health 
outcome exposed to polluting fuels and technologies 
against the counterfactual of no exposure. Furthermore, 
GBD estimated burden from exposure to solid fuels.9

Contrary to this, both we and WHO defined kerosene 
exposure as a polluting fuel.7 Using this definition, we 
identified 76 studies evaluating exposure to kerosene use, 
further explaining our higher burden estimates compared 
with GBD.18
Our rationale for a counterfactual of no exposure was 
multifactorial. First, only 5% of the studies identified had 
directly measured pollutant concentrations, with the 
majority of these evaluating symptoms rather than clinical 
outcomes and originating from high-income countries 
(appendix). Second, previous burden estimates1,8 for 
household air pollution were based on IER functions 
predominantly derived from studies in high-income 
countries and primarily evaluating exposure to ambient 
air pollution and smoking rather than household air 
pollution.9 This assumes that the adverse health effects of 
PM2·5 from household air pollution are comparable to 
those from other sources.22 Our choice of counterfactual 
attempts to estimate the specific risk associated with 
exposure to all household polluting fuels and technology. 
Third, WHO recommends a direct transition from 
polluting fuels and technologies to clean fuels.7 Although 
several trials have shown some potentially beneficial 
impact from the implementation of cleaner burning 
biomass-fuelled cookstoves, a ran­dom­ised controlled trial 
showed no improvement in outcomes.17 Our choice of 
the counterfactual reflects this policy7 and attempts to 
estimate the burden of disease avoidable if such a 
transition were achieved. Fourth, alternative counter­
factuals using theoretical minimum risk exposure 
thresholds are appropriate when estimating burden due 
to ambient air pollution, given the extensive ambient air 
quality monitoring systems in place and the literature 
evaluating health effects of directly measured ambient air 
pollutant concentrations.23,24 These well developed ambient 
air quality monitoring systems are therefore able to 
monitor air quality to ensure compliance with national 
and international thresholds.7 However, monitoring 
indoor air quality at scale, especially across LMICs, to 
ensure compliance with recommended mini­mum 
thresholds is likely to be financially and logistically 
prohibitive.20 This is reflected in the paucity of personal 
exposure studies evaluating health outcomes associated 
with household air pollution. Conversely, determining 
indoor air pollution exposure using questionnaire-based 
systems is practically more feasible, and has been shown 
to reflect exposures accurately.25
Several limitations need to be taken into account 
when interpreting our results. First, a binary indicator 
as a proxy for exposure does not take into account 
heterogeneity of exposure,20 which is likely to vary by fuel 
type, frequency and duration of exposure, and ventilation. 
Additionally, although some studies clearly stated the 
comparator group as those exposed to clean fuels, other 
studies defined the comparator as no exposure to a 
specific polluting fuel. As such, our approach increases 
the risk of exposure misclassification and is unable to 
show a dose–response relationship. Using these meta-
estimates in our burden estimates does not account for 
the indirect health impact of household air pollution, 
such as its contribution to ambient air pollution. Second, 
the majority of studies included in this meta-analysis 
were observational, with the level of adjustment varying 
considerably. One of the key factors that has hindered 
adoption of cleaner fuels in LMICs is affordability, 
compounded by issues with reliable supply chain and 
local cultural practices.19,26 Unmeasured confounding 
might have affected the comparability between those 
exposed versus unexposed in our study. Sensitivity 
analysis restricted to studies that used the comparator of 
clean fuel use or studies at low risk of bias did attenuate 
the overall burden. Third, many studies in our review 
were cross-sectional and therefore did not establish a 
temporal relationship between exposure to household 
air pollution and adverse health outcome. The pooled RR 
estimates were atten­uated in a sensitivity analysis 
restricted to only longitudinal studies. Fourth, we did not 
have access to individual participant-level data and 
therefore had to assume homogeneity of risk across all 
study participants for our health outcomes of interest. 
Finally, we observed significant heterogeneity in the risk 
estimates, and for several outcomes, such as athero­
sclerotic cardiovascular disease, the underlying distribution 
of the risk estimates did not conform to a normal 
distribution. Caution should therefore be exercised when 
interpreting the pooled risk estimates and highlights the 
need for more high-quality data to increase the certainty of 
these risk estimates.
Overall, the burden of disease attributable to household 
air pollution has declined over the past two decades, with 
clear geographical variation. The burden of disease from 
household air pollution is almost exclusively borne by 
LMICs where there is little access to electricity or gas 
cooking. Paradoxically, the greatest relative reduction in 
burden attributable to household air pollution was 
observed in Europe where the burden was the lowest. 
The African and Western Pacific regions, where the 
burden of disease due to household air pollution is much 
higher, have experienced a modest reduction in burden 
over the past two decades. The patterns of disease due to 
household air pollution have also evolved substantially, 
with communicable respiratory disease associated 
with household air pollution nearly halved but non-
communicable diseases such as lung cancer and 
cardiovascular disease increasing. This is of particular 
concern given that air pollution is now the second most 
important risk factor for non-communicable disease 
globally, and in many countries, particularly in the South-
East Asia region, it has overtaken tobacco smoking as the 
largest risk factor.1,15 Furthermore, incidence and deaths 
due to non-communicable diseases are projected to rise 
substantially in LMICs over the next few decades.27
Overall, deaths due to household air pollution have 
declined by nearly a third since 2000, although the totalArticles

number remains substantial at 1·8 million in 2017 
alone. Respiratory mortality due to household air 
pollution has declined more modestly but appears to 
have plateaued in recent years. Conversely, cardiovascular 
mortality has marginally increased. Most encouraging 
was a marked decline in under-5 mortality, which halved 
during the past two decades but still remains unac­
ceptably high, with the majority of burden borne by 
LMICs. There are several reasons why under-5 mortality 
attributable to household air pollution remains so 
pervasive. First, younger children, particularly those who 
are still breastfeeding, are more likely to remain indoors 
to be in close proximity to their mothers, resulting in 
greater exposure.21 Second, infants born to mothers 
exposed to polluting fuels were more likely to have low 
birthweight and this in itself increases the susceptibility 
of infants to complications such as hypothermia,28 car­
dio­respiratory abnormalities,29,30 and infections.31 Third, 
exposure to household air pollution is likely to reflect a 
more deprived socioeconomic status with little access to 
both cleaner fuels and health care, further contributing 
to under-5 deaths.32 As such, poverty remains a dominant 
mediator not only in preventing access to clean household 
energy but also exacerbating poor access to health care, 
compounding the burden associated with household air 
pollution.33
Achieving universal access to clean fuels and 
technologies for cooking by 2030 is a key element of 
the UN Sustainable Development Goals.34 Government 
intervention through targeted policy making and invest­
ments can accelerate the adoption of clean cooking 
solutions. Clean fuel subsidies in China, India, and 
Indonesia have already resulted in substantial reductions 
in people without access to clean cooking.35–37 Although a 
direct transition to clean fuels remains the ideal solution, 
in many regions, progress is slow. Acknowledging these 
challenges, WHO guidelines recommend where access 
to clean fuels and technologies remains near impossible, 
more advanced combustion cookstoves offering some 
health benefits should be prioritised in the transition 
to clean cooking solutions.7 Recent evidence, however, 
suggests that cleaner burning biomass-fuelled cook­
stoves do not deliver the expected health benefits.17 Our 
analysis further highlights the urgent need for clinical 
trials evaluating cleaner fuel interventions on health 
outcomes to underpin evidence-based policy and decision 
making.
In conclusion, our analysis shows that household air 
pollution increases the risk of a wide range of adverse 
cardiorespiratory, paediatric, and maternal health out­
comes. Although burden of disease due to household air 
pollution has declined by a third since 2000, the adverse 
health effects remain pervasive in LMICs in the South-
East Asia and African regions. There is an urgent need 
for evidence-based policy and decision making to ensure 
children and adults living in LMICs have clean air to 
breathe in their homes.

Health consequences of exposure to e-waste: an updated 
systematic review

Electronic waste (e-waste) contains numerous chemicals harmful to human and ecological health. To update a 2013 
review assessing adverse human health consequences of exposure to e-waste, we systematically reviewed studies 
reporting effects on humans related to e-waste exposure. We searched EMBASE, PsycNET, Web of Science, CINAHL, 
and PubMed for articles published between Dec 18, 2012, and Jan 28, 2020, restricting our search to publications in 
English. Of the 5645 records identified, we included 70 studies that met the preset criteria. People living in e-waste 
exposed regions had significantly elevated levels of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. Children and 
pregnant women were especially susceptible during the critical periods of exposure that detrimentally affect diverse 
biological systems and organs. Elevated toxic chemicals negatively impact on neonatal growth indices and hormone 
level alterations in e-waste exposed populations. We recorded possible connections between chronic exposure to 
e-waste and DNA lesions, telomere attrition, inhibited vaccine responsiveness, elevated oxidative stress, and altered 
immune function. The existence of various toxic chemicals in e-waste recycling areas impose plausible adverse health 
outcomes. Novel cost-effective methods for safe recycling operations need to be employed in e-waste sites to ensure 
the health and safety of vulnerable populations.
Introduction
Exponential growth in the electrical and electronic 
industries to meet customer demand has correspondingly 
generated large waste flows.1,2 Electronic and electrical 
waste (e-waste) can be defined as any “electrical or 
electronic equipment, which is waste, including all 
components, subassemblies and consumables, which are 
part of the equipment at the time the equipment becomes 
waste”.3 The Global E-waste Monitor estimated that 
53·6 million metric tons (Mt) of e-waste were produced 
globally in 2019. This figure is projected to grow to 74·7 Mt 
by 2030. Asia generated largest quantity of e-waste in 2019 
(24·9 Mt), followed by the Americas (13·1 Mt), Europe 
(12·0 Mt), Africa (2·9 Mt), and Oceania (0·7 Mt).4 An 
estimated 80% of e-waste from developed countries is 
illegally exported to low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) including China, India, Nigeria, Brazil, 
Ghana, and Pakistan, where labour costs and disposal are 
cheap and laws are less stringent or poorly enforced.5
E-waste contains numerous toxic chemicals including 
metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and nickel, and 
organic compounds such as flame retardants, chloro­
fluorocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and poly­
chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs). 
E-waste recycling also recovers valuable materials 
including iron, aluminium, copper, silver, and rare earth 
metals but excessive exposure can be noxious.6,7 These 
environmental contaminants pose severe threats to both 
the health of human beings and the environment.8
E-waste exposures occur in the informal and formal 
recycling sectors, and through contaminants that persist 
in the environment.9,10 Most e-waste recycling occurs in 
the informal sector, often in unregulated work settings or 
as cottage industries in homes.11 Recovery of precious 
metals is inefficient, incomplete, and generally carried 
out without personal protective equipment or modern 
technology.12 Hazardous processes include open burning, 
manual dismantling, plastic chipping and melting, 
heating, and acid leaching, cyanide salt leaching, 
and mercury amalgamation.9,13 Hazardous pollutants 
originating from such processes also contaminate 
ecosystems, leach into groundwater, contaminate food, 
and reduce air quality.14 Metal contaminants from e-waste 
are non-biodegradable, and can disturb the aquatic and 
terrestrial environment’s ecological balance by persisting 
in the environment.15 Formal e-waste recycling, in which 
salvageable materials are safely removed with adequate 
worker and environmental protection, is expensive, 
limiting feasibility in LMICs. Although several LMICs 
have enacted legislation to restrain illegal import of 
e-waste into their countries, none of the legislation 
effectively regulates e-waste processing.16
E-waste exposures to people occur through multiple 
complex pathways. Type of exposure source, duration of 
exposure, and probable inhibitory, synergistic, or additive 
effects of multiple exposures are all factors that can 
influence health outcomes.17 It is difficult to ascertain the 
effect of exposure to a specific e-waste related compound 
or element in isolation. Inhabitants and workers living 
near e-waste recycling sites can be exposed through 
inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption when they 
come into physical contact with contaminated soil, dust, 
air, water, or food sources.6,10 Residents living in the vicinity 
of e-waste recycling areas are at a particularly high risk of 
exposure. Exposure to contaminants associated with 
e-waste during gestation, infancy, or childhood can lead to 
obesity, asthma, or neuro­develop­mental disorders.18 
Adverse health outcomes associated with exposure to 
e-waste were reviewed in 2013 where 23 epidemiological 
studies were included from 2274 records published 
between Jan 1, 1965, and Dec 17, 2012.17 This Reviewe906

updates evidence of the association between e-waste 
exposure and adverse human health consequences, 
following PRISMA guidelines.19
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
The complete review protocol, methods, and criteria 
were based on our previous systematic review.17 We 
searched Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycNET, 
and CINAHL for articles published in English from 
Dec 18, 2012, to Jan 28, 2020 as previously described (full 
search terms are in the appendix).17 Our scope was 
limited to published epidemiological literatures that 
focused on exposure pathways in association with human 
health indicators (appendix). We excluded studies that 
reported outcomes in plants, animals, and in-vivo or 
in-vitro populations. We also excluded reviews, abstracts, 
editorials, correspondence, reports, book chapters, 
preface, commentary, and studies that did not report any 
human health outcome in relation to e-waste exposure. 
Our study was registered with PROSPERO, number 
CRD42021223833.
Data analysis
After preliminary title and abstract screening, relevant 
articles were retrieved based on predetermined criteria. 
Two independent reviewers (SMP and FJ) assessed 
eligibility, with disagreements resolved by consensus. 
The reviewers developed a data extraction sheet by 
piloting and revised accordingly. Each reviewer extracted 
data independently using a standardised protocol based 
on the following characteristics: publication details, 
study design, location, sampling population, sample 
size, exposure, health outcomes, and effect sizes of 
association between exposure and health outcomes 
(appendix). Risk of bias was determined by focusing on 
methodological criteria described elsewhere.17
Results
We identified 70 unique studies after full-text screening 
(figure). Most studies were done in China (n=66), 
followed by Vietnam (n=2), Ghana (n=1), and India (n=1). 
One study used a cohort design, and the rest were cross-
sectional in nature. The most common reason for 
excluding studies was that health effects from e-waste 
exposures were not reported for the study population 
(figure). 11 Chinese articles with English abstracts were 
identified. During screening, one study was eligible for 
full-text review which we could not assess.
Exposure to e-waste was associated with higher levels 
of many toxic chemicals and metals including: lead,20–55 
cadmium,20,22,23,26–29,31–33,39,45,56,57 mercury,32 manganese,26,36,39,49 
chromium,31,39,49,58 nickel,49,58,59 PAHs,21,48,60–64 PBDEs,29,35,61,65–76 
polychlorinated bisphenols (PCBs),35,54,67–70,72–75,77,78 dechlo­
rane plus (DP),77–79 PCDD/Fs,69 new flame retardants 
(NFR),72,74 bromophenols,67 perchlorate and thiocyanate,80 
polybrominated biphenyls,77 phthalate esters,81 bis­
phenols,82,83 and organophosphates.84 The chemical 
classification of e-waste components, sources and 
potential routes of exposure have been reported in the 
previous systematic review.17
Nine cross-sectional studies from China estimated the 
effect of e-waste-derived toxic chemicals on physical 
growth indicators. In general, increased toxicant levels 
were associated with poor foetal development in early life 
(table 1). Levels of PBDEs, PAHs, lead, and cadmium 
were significantly higher in exposed populations than 
they were in non-exposed individuals.20–23,56,60,65,66 In 
two studies, neonatal head circumference, body-mass 
index, and Apgar1 scores were negatively correlated with 
PBDE concentrations detected in placenta and umbilical 
cord.65,66 During pregnancy, higher urinary PAHs were 
associated with reduced birthweight, head circumference, 
body-mass index, and Apgar1 score.60 One study reported 
that blood PAHs were negatively associated with height 
and chest circumference in children aged 3–7 years.21 In 
three studies, blood lead exposure was associated with 
decreased child growth and development.21–23 A 10 ng/g 
increase in placental cadmium concentration was 
associated with a decrease of 205 g in weight and 0·44 cm 
in body length.20 Maternal urinary cadmium was 
associated with reduced birthweight, length, head 
circumference and Apgar scores in females neonates.56 
Conversely, two studies found no effect of blood cadmium 
on child growth parameters (table 1).22,23
Five cross-sectional studies investigated the relationship 
between lead, cadmium, and manganese and neuro­
developmental outcomes among young children in China 
(table 1).24–28 Higher blood lead levels were associated with

Review
poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes, while results were 
less consistent for other metals. In two studies, children 
had lower cognitive and language scores that were 
negatively correlated with blood lead;25,28 by contrast, no 
association was found with cadmium levels.28 Cai and 
colleagues24 found that children with higher blood lead 
levels had more sensory processing difficulties than 
did children with low blood lead levels. Behavioural 
abnormalities were found in children with higher blood 
levels of lead, cadmium, and manganese26 while in another 
study, children with high blood lead (≥10 µg/dL) had 
2·4-times higher odds of attention-deficit hyper­activity 
disorder than did those with low lead exposure (table 1).27
13 
studies 
investigated 
thyroid29,67–73,79,80 
and 
sex 
hormones30,74,85 (table 2). Overall, exposure to e-waste-
induced toxic chemicals disrupted thyroid function and 
had endocrine-disrupting effects on sex hormones. In 
two studies, thyroid hormones (THs) were measured 
among children aged 4–8 years.29,69 No hormonal differ­
ences were found between children in the exposed and 
control groups and the association was not significant 
between toxicants (PCBs, PBDEs, and PCDD/Fs) and 
THs.69 By contrast, PBDEs were negatively associated 
with free triiodothyronine in the adjusted regression 
model; however, no correlation was found between THs 
and blood lead or cadmium levels.29 Xu and colleagues69 
measured 
adrenocorticotropic 
hormone 
in 
young 
children which was positively correlated with serum 
PBDEs (table 2). In pregnant women, serum PCBs 
and PBDEs levels were negatively associated with 
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)71 and total thyroxine,71 
respectively, while DP concentration was positively 
associated with total triiodothyronine levels in maternal 
sera reported by Ben and colleagues.79 In three studies, 
serum PCBs were negatively associated with TSH,67 free 
triiodothyronine,70 and free thyroxine70,72 among adults. 
However, no association was observed between THs and 
PCBs/hydroxylated PCBs,73 or PBDEs70 in other studies. 
By contrast, serum PBDEs were negatively associated 
with thyroxine; similarly, NFR disrupted effects on 
thyroxine-binding globulin and TSH in Chinese adults.72 
In Vietnamese females, lower concentration of iodine 
was found where serum perchlorate or thiocyanate 
yielded no correlations with THs (table 2).80
Three studies investigated sex hormones in Chinese 
adults.30,74,85 Elevated serum oestradiol and progesterone 
were found in exposed pregnant women.85 Guo and 
colleagues74 observed disrupting effects of NFR with 
PBDE congeners on female follicle-stimulating hormone 
and male testosterone. Moreover, correlation between 
male sex hormones and blood lead level was somewhat 
signifi­cant, depending on age group assessed.30 In 
two studies,29,53 serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)–
IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) were measured in children 
aged 4–7 years where the investigators did not find an 
association between IGF-1 and PBDEs29 or lead.53 
However, one PBDE congener (BDE-209) was positively 
associated with IGFBP-3.29 Xu and colleagues61 reported 
that placental IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were significantly 
higher in women exposed to e-waste. Exposure to PBDEs

Review
including IL-1β,41,42 IL-27,42 1L-12p70,41 and IFN-γ.41 Another 
study noted a potential association between IL-1β and 
urinary PAH exposure.64 Huo and colleagues41 estimated 
the effect of lead exposure on expression of erythrocyte 
adhesion molecules (CD44 and CD58) where reduced 
erythrocyte immunity was observed due to long-standing 
environmental lead contamination among preschool 
children. Cao and colleagues40 observed higher proportions 
of CD4+ central memory T cells in an e-waste recycling 
area where exposure to lead contributed to the increased 
percentages of peripheral CD4+ central memory T cells. 
Another study found that CR1 expression, which plays 
crucial roles in B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte immune 
responses, was depressed due to lead exposure.43 
Two studies42,45 identified lower natural killer cells among 
exposed children, in one study elevated lead levels resulted 
in lower percentages of natural killer cells42 while another 
study did not (table 2).45
Findings from two studies observed telomere 
aberration among e-waste-exposed pregnant women57 
and local residents.75 The data suggested that telomere 
dysfunction is potentially induced through exposure to 
cadmium57 and persistent organic pollutants (POPs).75 
Placental telomere attrition probably begins to occur at 
the cadmium concen­tration of 0·0294 mg/g.57 Upon 
proteomic analysis in the umbilical cord, the investigator 
found altered protective cell oxidative damage (CAT and 
GSTO1) and cell apoptosis (Cyt c) biomarkers associated 
following exposure to PBDEs.65 In four studies, the 
micronucleus rate was used to evaluate genotoxicity and 
was found to be significantly elevated among residents 
living near the e-waste disposal site.35,54,75,78 However, He 
and colleagues78 revealed no correlation between POPs 
accumulation and micronucleus rate. RNA expression 
genes involved in ion binding, ion transport, immune 
regulation, apoptosis, and oxidoreductase activity were 
verified by quantitative fluorescence PCR where the 
number of genetic aberrations was higher in men than 
women.35 
Multiple 
studies 
observed 
significantly 
decreased DNA methylation in populations living in 
e-waste exposed regions (table 3).36,59,75
8-hydroxy-2ʹ-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of 
DNA oxidative damage was measured as the outcome in 
eight studies.31–33,62,63,81,82,84 Overall, the findings suggest that 
exposure to e-waste are associated with elevated oxidative 
stress. 8-OHdG concentrations were positively asso­
ciated with elevated blood lead,32 hydroxylated PAHs,62 
bis(2-chloro-isopropyl) phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, 
diphenyl phosphate,84 cadmium, chromium, nickel,31 
phthalate esters,81 arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium,33 and 
bisphenols-A (BPA)82 among e-waste exposed population. 
By contrast, some studies showed no statistical asso­
ciation between 8-OHdG and lead,31 cadmium,32 or 
hydroxy-PAHs.63 Li and colleagues77 found a possible 
linkage between PCBs and reactive oxygen species levels 
in immune cells which indicated higher oxidative stress 
in adults. Elevated malondialdehyde levels and decreases 
in both superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase 
activities suggest that oxidative stress was higher among 
parturient women and their matching fetuses at an 
e-waste exposed site relative to referents (table 3).85
Respiratory outcomes were investigated in four studies 
in China where the data suggest that living in an e-waste 
exposed area might accelerate the respiratory symptoms 
of children aged 2–8 years.38,39,86,87 In two studies, children 
exposed to e-waste had lower lung function levels 
including forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory 
volume in 1 s (FEV1).38,87 Zeng and colleagues38 did not find 
a significant association between blood lead or cadmium, 
or the combined effects of blood lead and cadmium, and 
lung function, while each unit of haemoglobin (1 g/L) 
decline was associated with 5 mL decrease in FVC and 
4 mL decrease in FEV1. However, elevated blood lead level 
(>5 µg/dL) was found as a risk factor for asthma (adjusted 
odds ratio 9·50, 95% CI 1·16–77·49).39 However, higher 
blood chromium and blood manganese in preschool 
children were associated with greater cough and wheeze, 
respectively.39 One study indicated that both birthweight 
and chest circumference might be good predictors for 
lung function levels which were positively associated.87 
Zhang and colleagues86 found that severe PM2·5 pollution 
in an e-waste recycling area resulted in heavy individual 
PM2·5 chronic daily intake, and reduced Please add 
salivary agglutinin (SAG) level in exposed children. 
Furthermore, ambient PM2·5 pollution reduces airway 
antimicrobial activity by down-regulating saliva SAG 
levels, which might accelerate airway pathogen infection. 
However, no correlation between saliva SAG level and 
proinflammatory cytokines was found (table 4).86
Six studies investigated haematological function as an 
outcome where lead, cadmium, PCBs, PBDEs, and 
PAHs were the primary chemical exposures with high 
concentrations among exposed preschool children,43–45,64 
local residents,70 and hospitalised patients.46 Two studies 
revealed that lead and PAH exposure were risk factors 
related to platelet indices among preschool children.44,64 
Similarly, blood and erythrocyte lead exposure was 
related to disadvantageous changes in red blood cells 
indices and haemoglobin in children from an e-waste 
recycling area.43 Zhang and colleagues45 concluded that 
the alteration of the number and percentage of innate 
immune cells were linked to higher lead and cadmium 
levels among e-waste exposed children. One study 
enrolled hospitalised patients from exposed and 
reference area where lead levels were correlated with 
elevated haematological parameters (red blood cells and 
haemoglobin levels).46 Native residents in an e-waste 
dismantling environment had increased body burden of 
PCBs and specific PBDE congeners which contributed to 
abnormal changes in haematological markers (table 4).70

Review
cardiovascular physiology. Three studies investigated 
cardiovascular risk in preschool children where vascular 
inflammation and lipid disorder were exacerbated by 
lead and PAH exposure47,48 and air pollutants resulted in 
increased heart rate and plasma norepinephrine in 
participants from e-waste recycling areas.88 In India, 
e-waste burning contributed to severe air pollution, 
potentially explaining alarming levels of heavy metals in 
adult residents, which were associated with increased 
prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity, specifically 
hypertension.58 Moreover, noise exposure was associated 
with increased heart rate in Ghanaian adults (table 4).89
We identified three studies49–51 that included the effect 
of heavy metals from e-waste on immune system 
responsiveness of young children after vaccination. 
Significantly elevated blood lead and lower antibody titres 
of vaccines were reported among exposed children than 
those from the reference group in all three studies.49–51 
Children chronically exposed to lead had suppressed 
antibody titres, indicating reduced immune responsive­
ness against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, Japanese 
encephalitis, polio,49 and hepatitis B.49,51 However, no 
significant correlation was found between blood lead and 
anti-measles, mumps, or rubella antibody titres (table 5).50
In three studies,37,52,53 hearing function was estimated 
concerning lead and cadmium exposures among preschool 
children. Exposed children had a higher prevalence of 
hearing loss than did reference children.37,52 Lead concen­
tration was significantly higher among exposed children 
than the reference group37,52,53 while no difference was 
found in urinary cadmium.37,52 Two studies found hearing 
loss was more likely due to lead exposure (adjusted odds 
ratio 1·24, 95% CI 1·03–1·49 and 1·40, 1·06–1·84).37,52 
Zhang and colleagues53 observed lower olfactory memory 
scores after odour exposure among children exposed to 
e-waste, which were negatively correlated with blood lead 
and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. 
Two studies identified that lower semen quality aggravated 
DNA damage (by comet assay) in e-waste exposed indivi­
duals compared with individuals from a reference site.54,76 
Semen quality parameters were negatively correlated with 
PBDE congeners in semen samples76 and exposure 
duration from e-waste has a strong association with 
genomic instability among adult men (table 5).54
Chen and colleagues46 showed elevated hepatic para­
meters in patients from the exposed group compared 
with reference groups. Both blood lead and cadmium 
were positively associated with alanine aminotransferase. 
Likewise, elevated blood lead (≥5 µg/dL) induced 
abnormal liver function (adjusted odds ratio 1·94, 95% CI 
1·00–3·73). Elevated serum creatinine and urinary 
β2-MG, which are clinical renal function indicators, were 
significantly higher among the exposed adult residents 
than the control group and they were positively correlated 
with serum PCBs.70 Increased levels of dental caries in 
deciduous teeth (62·5% vs 53·9%) and concomitantly 
lower salivary sialic acids were found in exposed 
preschool children when compared with preschool 
children from a reference town. Higher blood lead was 
adversely associated with salivary sialic acid levels 
indicating weakened oral anti-inflammatory ability.55 
Elderly individuals living in e-waste recycling areas had 
elevated BPA levels, correlating with e-waste dismantling 
activities indicating that BPA exposure is associated with 
abnormal fasting blood glucose (ie, hyperglycaemia and 
hypoglycaemia; table 5).83

Review
Discussion
The current systematic review is an update of our 
previous systematic review conducted in 2013 and 
contains new evidence regarding the health effects from 
e-waste exposures. The 2013 review contained 23 articles 
over a span of 47 years. Since then, 70 studies were 
published in 7 years. Most studies followed an ecological 
or retrospective cohort design that collected cases from 
exposure and referral sites. Ten studies were conducted 
in recycling sites and did not contain reference sites.
The toxic chemicals in e-waste can have a significant 
adverse impact on health of people living in exposed areas,

Review
particularly during sensitive windows of develop­ment 
such as pregnancy and childhood. Endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals (EDCs) such as phenols, phthalates, parabens, 
flame retardants, and heavy metals have potentially played 
adverse health impacts on human reproduction and 
development.90 
EDC 
exposures 
modulate 
various 
physiological processes in pregnant women, exposing the 
developing fetus to maternal nutritional, chemical, and 
environmental stressors. Such early life exposure could 
compromise the early developmental processes and 
predispose the fetus to adverse health risks later in life.91 
Moreover, the cumulative effect of EDC exposure is a 
considerable concern while humans are exposed to a 
multitude of EDCs at varying doses that might have 
additive, synergistic, or adverse biological effects.92,93 We 
provide evidence of adverse birth outcomes associated 
with heavy metals and organic chemicals.20,56,60,65,66 Previous 
studies have also shown that early exposure to heavy 
metals and organic pollutants in utero can lead to foetal 
growth retardation.94,95 Significant associations between 
PCBs and PBDEs and maternal serum THs indicate links 
between maternal health and infant development. Since 
the chemical structure of PCBs and PBDEs is similar to 
that of THs, these chemicals can disrupt the thyroid 
endocrine system,73 altered TH homoeostasis and induce 
neurotoxicity.96 Across multiple studies, we found a 
consistent association between the effects of e-waste 
exposure and placental transfer of toxic chemicals, 
bioaccumulation of chemicals, DNA methylation, sex 
hormone homoeostasis, and oxidative damage in pregnant 
women. EDC exposures are associated with changes in 
the gestational endocrine milieu, including altered levels 
of sex steroids,97 altered developmental trajectory of 
developing fetuses via epigenetic modifi­cations,98 modu­
lation of immune system, altered inflam­matory cytokine 
milieu to favour a proinflam­matory state,99 and might also 
affect circulating inflammation markers (interleukin-6, 
interleukin-10, c-reactive protein, and tumour necrosis 
factor-α).100 A consistent theme in the literature more 
broadly is that exposures in early life can potentiate 
detrimental effects and resulting in acute infections, 
morbidity, or even death in infancy and childhood, plus 
chronic conditions might deleteriously influence health 
trajectories in later life.101 However, we have found some 
conflicting findings; for example the effect of cadmium 
exposure on child growth and development. As cadmium 
accumulates with age, a plausible explanation is that 
children might be too young to manifest bone problems 
resulting from cadmium exposure.22
Children are particularly vulnerable compared with 
adults to environmental exposures due to additional 
exposure routes (eg, breastfeeding, placental exposure, 
and frequent hand-to-mouth behaviours), their higher 
basal metabolic rate and immature systems that might be 
unable to handle and excrete some toxic materials 
efficiently.12 Compared with adults, children also have 
more time to develop diseases that could be triggered by 
toxic chemicals in childhood and can evolve through 
multiple stages and years.102 Some studies we reviewed 
suggest extensive toxicological effects in multiple organ 
systems among children, including growth and neuro­
development, endocrine, respiratory, cardiovascular, 
haema­tological, immune, and genetic dysfunction related 
to e-waste exposures. However, consistency of association 
could not be assessed due to diverse variations in chemical 
exposure and associated outcomes.103 Also, several risk 
factors such as age, nutritional status, and predisposing 
conditions could influence the impact of toxic chemicals 
on health outcomes to some extent. However, the overall 
body of research suggests that children who are still 
growing and developing have a substantial risk of harm, 
from individual chemicals derived from e-waste.17,104

Review
in the previous review. A few studies have identified a 
link between chemical exposure from e-waste and 
suppressed immune response,49–51 hearing loss,37,52 altered 
hepatic and renal function,46,70 decline in oral anti-
inflammatory ability,55 and abnormal FBG.83
One of the strengths of the current systematic review is 
that most studies relied on biomarkers, which provide an 
objective measure of chemical exposure (ie, the internal 
dose). However, other methodological issues were 
identified in the previous review that remain unchanged 
in the current review. First, the current review did not 
contain any longitudinal, prospective studies that 
establish any temporality of associations. Lack of long-
term studies also affects data on diseases that have long 
latency periods. Second, we did not include any studies 
exploring dose–response relationships. Third, the sample 
sizes in the studies included in the current review were 
only 45–590 people; these low sample sizes are a source of 
continuing concern. However, given that so many studies 
identified an association between toxicants and adverse 
health outcomes within such small sample sizes, the 
effect sizes of the associations are probably substantial. 
Fourth, many studies did not adjust for confounders, 
which reduces our ability to draw inferences between 
exposure with health outcome.105 For example, BPA 
exposure is associated with obesity but BPA is found in 
less nutritious and calorie-dense packaged foods that can 
also increase the risk of obesity. If the consumption of 
packaged foods is not adjusted, BPA exposure could be 
assumed to be a risk factor for oxidative damage or 
adverse 
metabolic 
outcomes 
where 
consumption 
packaged foods might likely be driving these adverse 
health outcomes.106 Another example is socioeconomic 
background as a confounding factor. Children from lower 
socioeconomic backgrounds are more vulnerable to 
adverse cognitive health outcomes than are those from 
higher socioeconomic backgrounds.107 The current review 
contains multiple studies where the exposed and control 
groups were chosen from non-random populations. It is 
possible that socioeconomic background factors are 
driving some of the adverse health consequences and not 
the exposure to harmful toxicants. Fifth, there are periods 
of heightened vulnerability for the chemically exposed 
populations that can overestimate the health effects.105 
Sixth, most of the studies in the current review explored 
health outcomes related to isolated exposures. We do not 
know the cumulative and interactive effects of exposure 
to chemical mixtures, possibly owing to a high cost for 
multiple measurements.105 Also, no studies in this Review 
measure the attributable risk from different exposures 
which could mask the contribution of potentially 
predominant route of toxicant exposure such as dietary 
intake. Finally, more than 90% of the studies in this 
Review were undertaken in China, which limits the 
generalisability of findings. Future studies should 
therefore include longitudinal designs, methodologies 
that allow for exploration of exposure and dose-response 
relationships, larger sample sizes, adjust­ments for 
confounders, random sampling of study populations, and 
an exploration of health effects in relation to increasing 
and decreasing levels of vulnerability and chemical 
mixtures in addition to isolated chemical exposures. 
Furthermore, future studies can also sample toxicants 
from multiple sources to gauge the extent to which 
e-waste contributes to toxicity levels relative to other 
sources. Most importantly, future studies need to be 
conducted among more diverse populations in different 
countries across the world.
Addressing e-waste is in alignment with multiple UN 
Sustainable Development Goals pertaining to environ­
mental and human health protection (targets 3.9, 6.1, and 
6.3), reducing adverse environment impacts of cities 
(target 11.6), sound management of e-waste in accordance 
with agreed international frameworks (target 12.4), and 
protection of labour rights along with economic growth 
for vulnerable populations (targets 8.3 and 8.8). Alongside 
the Sustainable Development Goals, other initiatives that 
continue to address e-waste at an international policy 
level. For example, the Basel Convention regulates the 
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, including 
e-waste, and obliges countries to ensure safe management 
and disposal of e-waste and step focuses on scientifically 
developing a globally accepted standard for e-waste 
refurbishment and recycling. WHO’s Initiative on 
E-waste and Child Health aims to increase access to 
evidence, knowledge, and awareness of the health 
impacts of e-waste, improve health sector capacity to 
identify risks and track progress of good e-waste policies 
and interventions that protect public health. Furthermore, 
initiatives within the context of developed countries are 
moving towards circular economy strategies that are 
increasingly focusing on aspects of upscale design and 
production aspects rather than curative aspects of e-waste 
management.4 These initiatives include emphasising 
consumer and producer-end responsibilities such as 
improving recycling habits and designing eco-friendly 
products.
Although 78 countries have identified policies, 
legislation, or regulation governing e-waste, these are not 
usually legally binding, and—where they are legally 
binding—enforcement is often a challenge.4 Ultimately, 
creating and enforcing policies to prevent the prolifer­
ation of e-waste is not nearly enough. In LMICs countries, 
policies and intervention focusing on curative strategies 
are imperative for tackling the proliferation of e-waste, 
both domestic and imported. Further initiatives need 
to explore cost-effective methods and appropriate 
technologies based on chemical toxicity for safe recycling 
operations, including metal recovery and improvement 
of disposal systems. Such approach should consider the 
economic benefits of value recovery processes while 
ensuring the health and safety of populations that depend 
on informal e-waste recycling for their livelihoods and 
survival.e918

Population exposure to hazardous 
air quality due to the 2015 fires in 
Equatorial Asia

Vegetation and peatland fires cause poor air quality and thousands of premature deaths across densely 
populated regions in Equatorial Asia. Strong El-Niño and positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions 
are associated with an increase in the frequency and intensity of wildfires in Indonesia and Borneo, 
enhancing population exposure to hazardous concentrations of smoke and air pollutants. Here we 
investigate the impact on air quality and population exposure of wildfires in Equatorial Asia during Fall 
2015, which were the largest over the past two decades. We performed high-resolution simulations 
using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry based on a new fire emission 
product. The model captures the spatio-temporal variability of extreme pollution episodes relative to 
space- and ground-based observations and allows for identification of pollution sources and transport 
over Equatorial Asia. We calculate that high particulate matter concentrations from fires during Fall 
2015 were responsible for persistent exposure of 69 million people to unhealthy air quality conditions. 
Short-term exposure to this pollution may have caused 11,880 (6,153–17,270) excess mortalities. 
Results from this research provide decision-relevant information to policy makers regarding the impact 
of land use changes and human driven deforestation on fire frequency and population exposure to 
degraded air quality.
Vegetation and peatland fires are a common occurrence across Equatorial Asia1,2. Fires are used to manage the 
land, clear vegetation and to prepare and maintain land for agriculture3–6. Fires emit trace gases and fine par-
ticulate matter to the atmosphere causing extremely poor regional air quality7,8. Exposure of the population to 
degraded air quality results in thousands of premature deaths each year across Equatorial Asia9,10.
Whilst fires across Equatorial Asia have largely anthropogenic ignitions, with most burning occurring on 
deforested land11 and degraded peatlands12, the susceptibility of the landscape to fire is exacerbated by drought 
conditions during positive phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)13–15 and the Indian Ocean Dipole 
(IOD)16. Across Borneo, fire emissions in El Niño years can be up to 30 times greater than during La Niña17.
In September and October 2015, strong positive ENSO and IOD conditions suppressed precipitation over 
Indonesia resulting in a dry and highly flammable landscape and widespread fires18. These fires caused the larg-
est emissions of carbon dioxide from Equatorial Asia since the El Niño fires of 19974,19,20 and resulted in a large 
regional haze event. Total particulate matter emissions from this region were 1.8 Tg over the September-October 
period, 2.2 times the 2002–2014 mean (Figure S1a), suggesting that the exposure to particulate pollution was sub-
stantially greater than in other years. In Singapore (5.5 million people, Department of Statistics, Singapore) the 
Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)21, used to indicate the impact of ambient air pollution on human health, reported 
unhealthy conditions (PSI: 101–200) for more than 50% of days in September-October 2015, with shorter peri-
ods of very unhealthy (PSI: 201–300) and hazardous (PSI >​ 300) conditions. However, the extent of the regional 
haze and the number of exposed people across the densely populated Equatorial Asia (Fig. 1a) is not accurately

quantified due to the lack of high-resolution data in space and time either from remote sensing platforms or from 
numerical model simulations over the region.
In this work we quantify population exposure to degraded air quality conditions and associated mortality, 
which are mostly dictated by high concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μ​m 
([PM2.5]) attributable to the September-October 2015 wildfires. Our analysis is based on regional simulations 
of the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem)22,23 (Table S1) and an updated 
version of the Fire Inventory for NCAR24 (FINN v2, Fig. 1b and Figure S1b). The model is resolved at 10 km hori-
zontal grid spacing and provides hourly output of key meteorological and chemical variables, thus overcoming 
major limitations associated with the use of coarse resolution global models for analogous assessments (~200 km 
and daily output)8,10,25. We show that high-resolution simulations can accurately describe the spatial and temporal 
distribution of harmful air pollutants in the region as a result of fires and allow for a detailed estimate of the total 
population exposure to unhealthy air quality conditions and of the associated mortality.
Results and Discussion
We evaluate the model skill in reproducing spatio-temporal variability of aerosol optical properties and concen-
trations of particulate matter (PM) against a suite of space- and ground-based observations. WRF-Chem is able 
to simulate the spatial distribution of observed aerosol optical depth (AOD), with spatial correlation coefficients 
between weekly average AOD fields from MODIS (Terra and Aqua) and WRF-Chem ranging from 0.56–0.73 
(Figure S2). The model exhibits highest correlations with observations during September-October when fires 
were active and extreme pollution episodes occurred (Figure S1b), with lower correlations (~0.2) associated with 
the low AOD values recorded in November. The model is characterized by a systematic negative bias in compar-
ison to MODIS, with a Normalized Mean Bias Factor (NMBF, see Methods) of −​0.78 and −​0.54 for weekly aver-
aged AOD collected onboard Terra and Aqua, respectively. Model underestimation of observed AOD in regions 
impacted by fires has been reported by numerous previous studies7,8,10,26. Many of these previous studies increased 
emissions to match observed AOD, although uncertainties in aerosol optical properties and water uptake could 
contribute to model-observation discrepancy of AOD27. Despite the underestimation in AOD magnitude, the 
spatial pattern of simulated AOD values does not present any systematic bias after long-range transport as indi-
cated by the absence of sharp gradients in the ratio of simulated and observed AOD away from fire sources 
(Figure S2(d) and (h)). This thus increases the confidence in our simulated spatial patterns of AOD and hence our 
estimated regions of unhealthy air quality conditions.
To further examine the ability of the model to reproduce regional air quality we compared WRF-Chem output 
against two ground-based sites measuring concentrations of particulate matter. The model captures well both 
the magnitude and temporal variability of surface particulate matter concentrations measured over Singapore 
and Pekanbaru in Sumatra (Tables S2 and S3, Figs 1a and 2). Analyses of high frequency (30 minute to 1 hr) 
measurements collected at those sites reveal peak PM10 (i.e. particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less 
than 10 μ​m) concentrations above 600 μ​g m−3 in Pekanbaru and peak PM2.5 concentrations above 200 μ​g m−3 in 
Singapore, correctly simulated both in terms of magnitude and temporal occurrence (Fig. 2). The mean observed 
[PM2.5] in Singapore during September-November 2015 was 52 μ​g m−3, well reproduced by the model (45 μ​g m−3, 
NMBF =​ −​0.15; Table S3). During this period, the temporal variability of PM2.5 shows a correlation coefficient 
(R) of 0.45 between hourly observations and simulated values (R =​ 0.55 for daily mean concentrations, Table S3 
and Fig. 2b). Similar skills are found in Pekanbaru, where the mean observed [PM10] was 174 μ​g m−3, slightly 
underestimated by the model (140 μ​g m−3, NMBF =​ −​0.24) and R =​ 0.57 (R =​ 0.72 for daily aggregated data). 
The higher model skill (lower underestimation) in describing PM2.5 concentrations than AOD is likely due to the 
issues in representation of water uptake and other aspects of the AOD calculation in the adopted aerosol scheme. 
The close agreement between observed and simulated PM concentrations suggests that for simulation of surface 
particulate air quality, FINN fire emissions do not need to be scaled during this period. At the end of October the 
onset of seasonal rains extinguished fires across the region19 (Figure S1b), hence particulate matter concentrations 
observed in November when few fires occurred were much lower (19 μ​g m−3 in Singapore), with this transition 
reproduced by the model (21 μ​g m−3).

All regions in Singapore observed mean [PM2.5] above the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality 
guidelines for 24-hr [PM2.5] (25 μ​g m−3)28, with highest concentrations in the Western and Southern regions 
(Table S3). Similarly in Pekanbaru, observed [PM10] was considerably above the WHO air quality guidelines for 
24-hr [PM10] of 50 μ​g m−3. Simulated mean surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations exceeded the WHO air quality  
during September to October 2015, almost everywhere across Equatorial Asia (Fig. 3a and Figure S3a). To

estimate the impact of this regional pollution, we calculate the number of people exposed to PM concentrations 
above the WHO 24-hr guidelines for at least 50% of September to October 2015. We find that 185 million people 
were persistently exposed to [PM10] higher than the WHO 24-hr guidelines and 217 million people exposed to 
[PM2.5] higher than the WHO 24-hr guidelines (Figure S4). We quantify the contribution of wildfires in degrad-
ing air quality by comparing simulations including fire emissions and an analogous run without fires. Wildfires 
fires during September and October are responsible for increasing background PM concentrations over most 
areas by at least a factor of 30, and up to a factor of 100 over regions over the eastern part of the provinces of Jambi 
and South Sumatra, and Central Kalimantan (Fig. 3b and Figure S3b). In the absence of fires, 73 million people 
in the urban areas of Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, would have received 
persistent exposure to both [PM10] and [PM2.5] above WHO guidelines (Figure S4).
To further quantify the human population exposure to degraded air quality conditions, we calculate PSI 
values from simulated pollutant concentrations (see Methods) and estimate the number of people living in 
regions where the PSI is classified as unhealthy for at least 50% of the September-October 2015 period (Fig. 4a)29. 
Unhealthy PSI on at least one day in two occurred over most of Sumatra, Borneo, Malaysia and Singapore (con-
sistently with Singapore PSI reports21) and very unhealthy and hazardous PSI were experienced in regions over 
Jambi and Palembang in Sumatra and Central Kalimantan (Fig. 4a). We calculate that in total 69 million people 
were exposed to unhealthy PSI levels, and that 6 million and 2 million people were exposed to very unhealthy and 
hazardous conditions for 50% of the period, respectively (Fig. 4a). Simulations without fire emissions indicate 
Figure 4.  Human exposure to unhealthy air quality and premature deaths. (a) Areas of unhealthy (yellow, 
PSI >​ 100), very unhealthy (orange, PSI >​ 200) and hazardous (red, PSI >​ 300) air quality conditions on at 
least one day in two during September-October. The colored numbers refer to the total number of people 
(M =​ million) exposed to those different thresholds. For comparison, when only anthropogenic emissions 
are present, the number of people exposed to unhealthy conditions is approximately 4 million and no people 
are exposed to very unhealthy or hazardous conditions. Map created using Matlab vR2014b mapping toolbox

exposure to [PM2.5] from wildfires during September-October (the pink shading indicates the 95% confidence 
interval). The total number of fatalities estimated is 11,880 (6,153–17,270) people (see Methods for details).www.nature.com/scientificreports/

that only 4 million people, concentrated within the urban areas of Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Ho Chi Minh City, 
would have been exposed to unhealthy PSI levels. Thus, our work indicates fires are responsible for increasing 
population exposure by more than factor 15, resulting in an additional 65 million people exposed to unhealthy 
conditions. The discrepancy in population exposure estimated using PSI relative to the WHO 24-hr limits (Figs 4 
and S4) is attributable to the less restrictive bounds for unhealthy conditions in the PSI definition (Table S4).
We calculate excess all-cause mortality due to short-term exposure to PM2.5 using simulated 24 hr [PM2.5] and 
exposure-response functions from the most recent and comprehensive epidemiological studies linking health 
impacts to short-term exposure to outdoor fine particulate matter30,31 (see Methods). We apply a short-term 
exposure-response function because the population was exposed to high levels of pollution for <​60 days and 
emissions during this period were substantially greater than usual (Figure S1). We estimate an additional 11,880 
(with a 95% confidence interval of 6,153–17,270) all-cause premature mortalities due to short-term exposure to 
high concentrations of PM2.5 associated with wildfires during September-October 2015 (Figs 4b and S5a). This 
number of premature deaths is a conservative estimate since it is inferred from particulate matter concentrations 
that are slightly underestimated in our model simulations. Further, the estimated deaths represent only a fraction 
of the overall premature fatalities due to long-term exposure to unhealthy air quality conditions.
We have shown that a high-resolution regional atmospheric model in combination with satellite-derived fire 
emissions can provide a reliable assessment of air quality conditions during an intense air pollution episode 
caused by landscape fires. Our work confirms that the Fall 2015 Indonesian fires resulted in regional scale air 
pollution, with 69 million people exposed to persistent poor air quality, equivalent to 24% of the combined pop-
ulation of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. Further, we estimate that 11,880 fatalities occurred as a result of 
short-term exposure to extreme particulate matter concentrations. If fires similar to those of Fall 2015 were to 
become more frequent, either due to changes in climate or through expansion of oil palm and timber conces-
sions12, the public health burden from air pollution would rise considerably. We estimate that ~75,600 excess 
premature mortalities (Figure S5b and Table S5, see Methods) would occur each year if the population received 
long-term exposure to the pollutant concentrations experienced in Fall 2015, consistent with a previous estimate32. 
Fire mitigation and control measures need to be implemented to prevent such episodes occurring in the future18.
Methods
WRF-Chem simulations. 
We applied the Weather Research and Forecasting model (version 3.5) with 
Chemistry (WRF-Chem)23 at 10 km horizontal resolution, with 51 vertical levels, over Equatorial Asia from 1 
September to 1 December 2015. The domain is centered at (115°E, 2°N) and extends over 490 ×​ 300 grid cells 
(longitudes ×​ latitudes). A detailed summary of the physical and chemical schemes applied is provided in 
Table S1. Meteorological and chemical lateral boundary conditions are specified every 6 hours using output from 
the high resolution European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (HRES-ECMWF) model at ~16 km33, 
and MOZART-4 (Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, version 4)34. Climatological dust fields within 
MOZART-4 are replaced with CAM-Chem (Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry) dust which are 
computed according to model simulated wind speeds and surface conditions35. To constrain the meteorology 
we use Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (FDDA)36 to analysis-nudge model water vapor, wind and temper-
ature fields above the boundary layer, with updates from ECMWF data every 6 hours. Biogenic emissions are 
computed online with MEGAN (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature) version 2.0437, whereas 
fire emissions are specified using the FINN (Fire INventory from NCAR)24 inventory version 238. FINN provides 
daily global estimates of trace gases and particles emitted by open biomass burning at ~1 km resolution. The new 
FINNv2 computes fire area burned from the available fire detections in a novel way relative to FINNv1.5 and also 
includes updated emission factors39–42, fuel loadings, and year-specific land cover datasets. Non‐methane organic 
compound emissions were allocated to the lumped chemical species of the MOZART mechanism based on the 
updated emission factors. Given this work focuses on the health impacts which are inferred from aerosol sur-
face concentrations, the adopted plume-rise parameterization is expected to have little impact on the estimated 
health burden, as it largely affects the vertical distribution of aerosols, particularly in the upper troposphere43. 
Anthropogenic emissions are updated on a monthly basis using the EDGAR-HTAP V2.044 inventory for 2010, 
which incorporates EDGAR 4.3 global emissions with the Regional Emission inventory in ASia (REAS)45 version 
2.1, where available, on a 0.1° ×​  0.1° grid resolution. The MOZART gas-phase chemistry is coupled with the 
GOCART (Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport)46 bulk aerosol approach to reduce the 
computational cost. The aerosol direct and indirect feedbacks are turned off.
Observations. 
Daily observations of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at a wavelength of 550 nm collected by 
the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua satel-
lites are used to evaluate model skills in reproducing the spatio-temporal patterns of intense pollution episodes 
associated with fires. Level-2 MODIS Collection-6 data, which have a resolution of 10 ×​ 10 km (at nadir) for both 
Land and Ocean, are used in this study47. In the evaluation, daily values from WRF-Chem are extracted at the 
overpass hour (~10:30 and ~13:30 local solar time for MODIS onboard Terra and Aqua, respectively) and only 
pixels with simultaneous cloud free conditions in both MODIS and the model are considered when making the 
comparison with Taylor diagrams (see Figure S2 and section below on model evaluation for more details).
Simulated particulate matter concentrations are evaluated relative to ground-based measurements over 
Singapore and Sumatra. Hourly [PM2.5] from Singapore are collected by the National Environment Agency (NEA) 
using a Thermo Scientific™​ 5030 SHARP Monitor over five regions (Table S2) during September-November 2015 
and have been accessed from the National Environment Agency website21. Model evaluation is conducted by 
averaging the grid cells that included the five regions defined by NEA. NEA also provides an hourly Pollutantwww.nature.com/scientificreports/

Standards Index (PSI, defined in the next section)21, which was used in this study to evaluate threshold exceed-
ances simulated by the model.
30-min [PM10] measured at Pekanbaru (101.45 E, 0.51 N) in the Riau region using a Met One BAM 1020, 
Real-Time Portable Beta Attenuation Mass Monitor (BAM-1020) were analyzed for the entire simulation period.
For both Singapore and Sumatra, model skill was quantified based on PM hourly and daily means, selecting 
only hours with simultaneous data available between observations and model simulations.
Population data and Pollutant Standards Index (PSI). 
Population exposure to degraded air quality 
conditions and premature deaths are estimated based on the 2013 LandScan High Resolution global Population 
Data product that provides population density data gridded with a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 
1 km at the equator)29. The population density data have been upscaled to match the WRF-Chem grid, averaging 
over cells of size 0.1 degrees over latitude and longitude. The final population data are then obtained by multiply-
ing the population density by each grid cell surface area. The total population over the analyzed domain is ~488 
million people.
Population exposure is quantified based on exceedances of the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), which allows 
assessment of air quality conditions based on six criteria pollutant concentrations and classifies air quality at dif-
ferent levels (from good to hazardous)21.
The PSI is defined as:

Statistical metrics of model performance. 
We use Taylor diagrams48 to compare spatial patterns of 
weekly averaged AOD fields from MODIS observations and WRF-Chem simulations. Taylor diagrams provide 
information on the spatial correlation coefficient (R), the Root Mean Squared Difference that is proportional to 
the distance of a point to a reference on the x-axis, and the ratio of spatial standard deviations between observa-
tions and simulated values.
We also assess model performance in reproducing hourly observations of particulate matter concentrations in 
terms of Normalized Mean Bias Fraction (NMBF), which is a symmetric and unbiased metric49:

indicates that the model overestimates observations by a factor 1 +​ NMBF, whereas if it is negative WRF-Chem 
underestimates observations by a factor 1-NMBF.
Mortality estimates. 
Estimation of all-cause mortality for the overall population due to short-term expo-
sure to increased PM2.5 from fires is performed using simulated surface-level [PM2.5] in combination with an 
exposure-response function31. We calculate the Relative Risk (RR) due to short-term exposure as:
γ

where PMF and PMNF are the daily PM2.5 concentrations (in μ​g m−3) in the run with fire and no fire emissions 
respectively, and γ is the excess mortality per unit increase in PM2.5. A recent meta-analysis of 110 peer-reviewed 
epidemiological short-term time-series studies of daily mortality and hospital admissions have estimated this 
parameter as 0.00104, with a 95% confidence interval of (0.00052, 0.00156)30. It is important to note that the RR 
meta-analysis by Atkinson et al.30 does not include epidemiological studies from Equatorial Asia since they don’t 
exist and it is mostly based on studies conducted in Europe and in the United States. This implies that short-term 
mortality estimates for Equatorial Asia (independently on the RR functional form adopted) are likely to be con-
servative as based on RR functions developed on lower pollutant levels than those observed in our region. The

from the 2012 country-specific statistics from the WHO Global Health Observatory50 and Ptot is the total popula-
tion for each grid point from the 2013 LandScan High Resolution global Population Data29.
To estimate premature mortality due to long-term exposure to wildfire PM2.5, we use the integrated 
exposure-response (IER) relationship51 that compiles epidemiological evidence across a wide range of PM con-
centrations from different combustion sources. The IER has been used in a number of recent studies9,52–57 and 
allows for age-dependent calculation of relative risk for five different diseases (RRd) associated with PM2.5 expo-
sure: lower respiratory infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, ischemic heart disease 
and stroke.
We estimated wildfire contribution to premature mortality due to long-term exposure to PM2.5 using the RR 
lookup table and AF function in53:

where PM2.5,F and PM2.5,NF refer to the annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in μ​g m−3 in the run including fires and 
the control run without fires, respectively. The annual mean for the run including fires was estimated assuming 
that only two months (i.e. September and October) contributed to fire emissions and that November is repre-
sentative of PM concentrations during the months without fires. The total mortality can be then calculated by 
applying Equation 5. Cause-specific background disease rates for the Southeast Asian region are taken from 
Global Burden of Disease 2013 assessment58 for the year 2013 (latest year available), while population age-group 
structures are taken from55 for the year 2010 (latest year available).

This study uses satellite data to detect agricultural straw burning and estimates its impact on air pollution and
health in China. We ﬁnd that straw burning increases particulate matter pollution and causes people to die from
cardiorespiratory diseases. We estimate that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 increases mortality by 3.25%. Middle-
aged and old people in rural areas are particularly sensitive to straw burning pollution. Exploratory analysis of
China’s programs to subsidize straw recycling suggests that extending these programs to all the straw burning
regions would bring about a health beneﬁt that is an order of magnitude larger than the cost.
1. Introduction
Farmers often burn agricultural straw residues from crops such as
wheat, rice, maize, and cotton in situ after harvest. Straw burning is
particularly prevalent in developing countries that rely heavily on agri-
cultural production and is a major cause of seasonal air pollution
(Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Gadde et al., 2009; Rangel and Vogl, 2019).
However, effective regulations on straw burning are rare and the lack of
scientiﬁc evidence on how straw burning affects people’s health can
make the government reluctant to design and enforce strict regulations.
In this study, we estimate the impacts of straw burning on air pollution
and mortality using data from China and try to quantify the potential
beneﬁts of China’s recent efforts in straw recycling.
Our analysis is based on a novel panel dataset that assembles detailed
information on straw burning, air pollution, and mortality in China.
High-resolution satellite image data are used to identify the exact loca-
tions of straw burning in China from 2013 to 2015. Straw burning data
are then linked to local air quality data collected from 1650 ground-level
monitors. Death records from a quarter of the Chinese population are
obtained from the Disease Surveillance Point system (DSPS) of China’s
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which contains information
on gender, age group, and cause of death at the county level for the same
period.
With these data matched at the county level, we then estimate how
straw burning affects air pollution and mortality. Our baseline results
show that 10 additional straw ﬁres within 50 km of a county center will
lead to a 4.79 μg/m3 (or 7.62%) increase in monthly ﬁne particulate
matter (PM2.5, diameter < 2.5 μm) and a 1.56% increase in all-cause
mortality in Chinese counties. Using straw burning as an instrumental
variable, we further estimate that a 10 μg/m3 increase in monthly PM2.5
can lead to a 3.25% increase in mortality. Heterogeneity analyses reveal
that straw burning pollution primarily increases cardiorespiratory mor-
tality, and has a strong impact on people over 40 in rural and poor areas,
but has no statistically signiﬁcant impact on younger people.
The key concern of our baseline IV estimate is that straw burning may
affect human health through channels other than air pollution. For
example, local governments may implement straw burning regulations
that are endogenous to local population health. It is also possible that
straw burning can create temporary income shocks to farmers, as the
activity is associated with harvesting. To address these issues, we adopt
two augmented IV strategies, which together lend additional credibility
to our baseline ﬁnding. In our ﬁrst augmented strategy, we use non-local

straw burning). Non-local straw burning is an appealing instrument for
air pollution because the burning behaviors of non-local farmers are
typically not subject to the local government’s control. In the second
strategy, we follow Rangel and Vogl (2019) and explore different wind
patterns for identiﬁcation. We separate straw burning from upwind and
downwind areas and use the difference in the coefﬁcients between up-
wind and downwind ﬁres to isolate the pollution effect from the potential
income effect. The identiﬁcation relies on the fact that upwind and
downwind straw ﬁres have asymmetric impacts on air pollution, but have
symmetric impacts on local people’s income. In both exercises, we obtain
estimates that are quantitatively similar IV to the baseline model, sug-
gesting the endogeneity of straw burning is not a big concern in our
research context.
Based on our ﬁndings, we then evaluate China’s recent straw recy-
cling policy, launched in 2016. We ﬁnd that subsidizing straw recycling
effectively improved air quality and the estimated health beneﬁts could
outweigh the costs by an order of magnitude. Speciﬁcally, using a
Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, we show that the number of
straw ﬁres in subsidized provinces dramatically declined after the policy
(by 153 a year), relative to the non-subsidized provinces, and this change
brought down the annual average PM2.5 concentration by 4.33 μg/m3.
These estimates imply that the straw recycling policy could have averted
18,900 pre-mature deaths annually in China.
We contribute to the literature in three ways. First, this paper adds to
the emerging literature on the impacts of straw burning (e.g. Graff Zivin
et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2018; Rangel and Vogl, 2019). In this thin line of
literature, Rangel and Vogl (2019) are the ﬁrst to link agricultural
burning to health outcomes. Exploiting the interactions between wind
patterns
and
sugarcane
harvest
ﬁres
in
Brazil,
they
show
that
late-pregnancy exposure to upwind ﬁres decreases birth weight, gesta-
tional length, and in-utero survival, but not early neonatal survival. Graff
Zivin et al. (2019) adopt a similar approach and ﬁnd that air pollution
from agricultural ﬁres lowers the cognitive performance of students in a
high-stakes test in China. Lai et al. (2018) investigate how agricultural
ﬁre affects cognitive function among the Chinese people and show that
more straw burning reduces old people’s cognition and memory. Our
main contributions beyond Rangel and Vogl (2019) are that (1) we are
able to investigate the impacts of straw burning on mortality for different
age groups, which helps highlight the most vulnerable people to straw
burning pollution, and (2) we apply our estimates to assess a recent straw
recycling policy implemented by the Chinese government.
Second, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant rural-urban heterogeneity in the air
pollution effect. Due to data limitations, rural residents have largely been
ignored in existing air pollution studies. Notable exceptions include Zhou
et al. (2015) and Fan et al. (2020). In both studies, the authors ﬁnd that
air pollution effects are larger and statistically signiﬁcant in rural areas,
but small and statistically insigniﬁcant in urban areas. While our research
context is different from the previous studies, we also ﬁnd that straw
burning and air pollution signiﬁcantly increase the mortality of rural
residents and poor residents, but not that of urban or rich residents. These
results together suggest that better socio-economic conditions can miti-
gate the health damage of air pollution.
Finally, we show that China’s recent straw-recycling subsidy signiﬁ-
cantly reduced straw burning activities, which provides important in-
sights into designing effective straw burning regulations. Historically, the
Chinese government relied on command-and-control regulations to
reduce straw burning. Due to the high enforcement costs, however, these
policies were not very successful. In contrast, providing subsidies to
farmers and recycling companies immediately led to less burning and
improvement in air quality. The incentive-based approach seems to
outperform the command-and-control approaches in our research
context. These ﬁndings can be referenced by other agrarian economies
with similar agricultural burning issues.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the
practice of straw burning in China and reviews the current literature.
Section 3 describes the data on straw burning, deaths, pollution and
weather, followed by an introduction on data compilation, a summary of
key variables, and descriptive analyses. Section 4 discusses our empirical
strategy. Section 5 reports the main ﬁndings. Discussions of caveats and
robustness checks follow in Section 6. Section 7 explores a variety of
heterogeneities in the health effects of straw burning pollution. Section 8
estimates the impact of the straw recycling policy and conducts an
exploratory beneﬁt-cost analysis. Section 9 concludes.
2. Background
2.1. Agriculture and straw management in China
China has the largest straw resource in the world. With a sown area of
0.11 billion ha, China produced 0.62 billion tons of grain in 2015,1 ac-
counting for 24% of the total grain output worldwide.2 The major crops
in China are maize, rice, and wheat. Rice is mainly planted in the south,
while wheat is common in the northern and central regions. Maize is
widely planted, with its main production area in northeastern China.
Two-season planting is common in central, eastern and southern China
but is rare in northern regions, which are colder and have a longer
winter. As a result, straw production also varies over time and space.
China produces the largest amount of agricultural straw residues in
the world. In 2012, nearly one billion tons of straw were produced,
contributing to 18.5% of the global straw production. Straw consists of
crop stubble and stalks. Crop stubble is usually left on the farmland after
harvest and then burnt in situ. Stalks are longer and can be collected after
being cut, but a large portion of them remain unrecycled (Shi et al.,
2014). According to China’s Ministry of Agriculture, 320 million tons of
straw were not utilized in 2015, accounting for about 31% of the total
straw produced nationwide.3
The straw burning seasons in China are from late May to late July and
from late September to late November each year.4 Farmers burn straw for
several reasons. First, they need to clear their ﬁelds for the next round of
cultivation, but straw does not decompose quickly. Second, ﬁres kill
pests, weeds, fungi and bacteria that can be harmful to new crops. Third,
the ashes can fertilize the farmland. Finally, alternative measures (such as
straw returning and straw recycling) require additional labor work that is
not economically rewarding.
There are two primary ways of straw utilization: straw returning and
straw recycling, both of which are time-consuming and labor-intensive.
Straw returning, or soil incorporation, means to cut straw into smaller
pieces and put them back into the farmland as fertilizer. However, the
small pieces can make plowing inconvenient. Because the decomposition
process takes time, straw returning often hinders crop growth in the short
run. Straw recycling means re-using straw for other purposes, such as
industrial materials, fuel and animal feed. Because each household owns
only a small piece of farmland, the economy of scale of straw recycling
cannot be easily realized. Burning straw after harvest thus is a common
practice in China.
2.2. Straw burning and air pollution
Pollution from straw burning is a typical example of a negative ex-
ternality. It originates from rural farms and can travel to distant regions.
The impact of straw burning on air pollution has been discussed exten-
sively in the science community, with a focus on measuring pollutant
emissions, numerically modeling the transmission of emissions, and

2analyzing the physicochemical reactions of air pollutants (see Chen et al.,
2017 for a recent review).
The substances emitted from straw burning include particulate matter
(PM), volatile organic compounds, carbon dioxide, and other compounds
known to be toxic (Andreae and Merlet, 2001). Straw burning emits a
large amount of PM, which is dominated by submicron and ﬁne particles.
According to Zhang et al. (2016), the annual PM2.5 emissions from open
straw burning are about 1.036 million tons, accounting for 7.8% of total
anthropogenic emissions of PM in China. In eastern China, straw burning
emissions could contribute up to 56% of total emissions in the summer.
Straw burning emits little SO2 and NOx, which are common pollutants
from other sources such as fossil fuels (Streets and Waldhoff, 2000).
While straw burning also generates small amounts of CO and secondary
O3, these pollutants are generally less stable and persistent in the air than
PM, and therefore straw burning is not considered a major contributor to
these pollutants.5 Weather conditions, such as temperature and humid-
ity, can also affect the smoke’s composition and the generation of other
secondary pollutants.
PM emissions from straw burning can travel long distances, and
critics sometimes blame straw burning for the large-scale and widespread
haze episodes in China.6 However, there is a lack of research that
quantiﬁes the impacts of straw burning on air quality at the national
scale. Existing scientiﬁc studies that use numerical modeling to quantify
the impacts of straw burning on air pollution tend to be applicable only to
speciﬁc areas within a short period of time, in part due to the huge un-
certainties in the emission inventories and the complex interactions be-
tween straw burning emissions and meteorological factors (Chen et al.,
2017).
2.3. Air pollution, health, and straw burning regulations
A large number of economic studies have documented that air
pollution can signiﬁcantly damage human health, in both developed
countries (e.g. Arceo et al., 2016; Chay and Greenstone, 2003; Currie and
Neidell, 2005; Currie et al., 2014; Schlenker and Walker, 2015) and
developing countries (e.g. Chen et al., 2013; Ebenstein et al., 2017; Fan
et al., 2020; He et al., 2016). To identify the causal impact, previous
studies typically focused on policies that directly affect air pollution
levels (such as the Clean Air Act in the U.S.) or explore the sources of air
pollution (such as cars, airplanes, and wildﬁres).
Until very recently, economists did not investigate pollution caused
by straw burning. There are at least two empirical challenges. First,
credible data on agricultural ﬁres are not readily available. Second,
isolating the pollution effect of straw burning can be challenging, as
straw burning can be associated with local economic activities that may
affect human health. Rangel and Vogl (2019) are the ﬁrst to look into this
issue; they utilize satellite data to overcome the data barrier and explore
wind patterns to pin down the air pollution effect.7 Given that almost all
the developing countries and many developed countries are subject to
such seasonal air pollution threats, there is a great need for additional
evidence on how straw burning affects human health in a broader context
and on how to design effective policies to control agricultural ﬁres.
Conceptually, agricultural ﬁres share a lot of similarities to wildﬁres.
While little research can be found on agricultural ﬁres, multiple studies
have assessed the impacts of wildﬁres. For example, Jayachandran
(2009) examines the effect of smoke (measured by aerosol from satel-
lites) on early-life mortality during a big forest ﬁre in Indonesia in 1997
and ﬁnds that the ﬁre signiﬁcantly worsened infant health in poor areas.
Sheldon and Sankaran (2017) show that Indonesia’s wildﬁre affected
Singapore’s air pollution and increased hospital admissions. Miller et al.
(2017) use smoke plumes to identify pollution from wildﬁres in the U.S.
and show that wildﬁres could affect PM concentrations and impair the
health of the elderly in regions where background levels of air pollution
are low. Other studies have shown that wildﬁres also have impacts on
labor supply, housing prices, hospitalization and defensive (avoiding)
expenditures (e.g. De Mendonça et al., 2004; Donovan et al., 2007;
Moeltner et al., 2013; Richardson et al., 2012).
Unlike natural wildﬁres, however, agricultural ﬁres are mostly
anthropogenic. They occur more frequently than wildﬁres and spread
across many countries and regions. Because a large proportion of the
world’s population still live in agricultural regions, the aggregate impact
of straw burning can be orders of magnitude larger than that of wildﬁres.
Therefore, estimating the impact of agricultural ﬁres and identifying
effective ways to control straw burning are of great policy relevance and
urgency.
In the past two decades, the Chinese government tried a variety of
policy instruments to control straw burning activities. The government
historically relied on command-and-control regulations, and straw
burning was ofﬁcially banned in the 1990s. Some local governments
required village leaders to patrol and do surveillance; some educated
farmers through propaganda; and some applied administrative sanctions
to local village leaders (such as dismissal or suspension) if villagers were
found burning straw. Unfortunately, most of these regulations were too
difﬁcult and costly to implement. The reality is that rural households
continued to burn straw regardless of various bans. For example, in our
data, the number of straw ﬁres actually increased signiﬁcantly from 2012
to 2015.
Seeing that the command-and-control regulations were ineffective,
starting in 2016, the central government turned to an incentive-based
policy that provides subsidies to farmers and enterprises for straw recy-
cling. As will be elaborated later in this paper, this subsidy seems effec-
tive and has signiﬁcantly reduced straw burning.
3. Data
3.1. Straw burning data
Straw burning can be detected by remote sensing from satellites. In
China, the Satellite Environment Center of the Ministry of Ecology and
Environment (MEE) collects daily straw burning data from the moderate
resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) of NASA’s Satellites
TERRA and AQUA. These satellites overpass China twice a day in the
daytime (around 10:30 and 13:30 local time) and twice each night
(around 22:30 and 1:30 local time) and report all ﬁre pixels detected with
250, 500, or 1,000 m resolution (Kaufman et al., 1998). A ﬁre point is
identiﬁed when a thermal anomaly is detected within a pixel using a
contextual algorithm that exploits the mid-infrared radiation from ﬁres
(Justice et al., 2002). Therefore, the burnt area can be much smaller than
the satellite resolution. MODIS routinely detects both ﬂaming and
smoldering ﬁres and the minimum area reported is about 50 square
meters under good weather conditions. A large ﬁre can be recorded as
multiple ﬁre points or pixels. Estimation of the burnt area is not recom-
mended due to large uncertainties in modeling.8
The MEE checks the MODIS ﬁre data and distinguishes straw burning
from other types of ﬁres (such as wildﬁres) based on geographical
5 Existing evidence shows that the amount of CO generated by incomplete
combustion during open straw burning is low (Zhang et al., 2013) and that the
association between biomass burning and O3 is also weak (Jaffe et al., 2013;
Rangel and Vogl, 2019). O3 in the troposphere is mainly contributed by vehicle
and industrial processes, and the formation of O3 is complex, depending on
nonlinear interactions with temperature, solar radiation and other precursors.
6 For example, Xinhua News: http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2015-10/
20/c_1116884784.htm.
7 Several associational studies in the public health literature also investigated
the relationship between straw burning and health (e.g. Jacobs et al., 1997).
Due to lack of convincing identiﬁcation strategies, estimates from these studies
can be biased (see Dominici et al., 2014) and we therefore do not discuss the
details of these studies.

3information and land use. The measure of straw burning is consistent and
comparable over time and across regions. Straw is burnt after harvesting
and before planting. As China has two planting seasons, we also observe
two burning seasons, one in summer and the other in late autumn and
early winter.
One limitation of the satellite data is that it does not distinguish large
straw ﬁres from smaller ones. However, because each household is only
allowed to lease a small piece of land in China, we believe the size of each
straw ﬁre is similar in size, especially within the same county.9 Another
limitation is that satellites capture this data only when they pass over the
continent. Since straw burning may occur during non-overpassing pe-
riods and die out without thermal anomalies when satellites pass, the
number of actually ﬁres can be under-estimated. Thus, the precise
interpretation of our regressions is that they estimate the effects of straw
burning detected by satellite on air pollution and mortality.
3.2. Death data
Death data were collected from the Disease Surveillance Point System
(DSPS) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The DSPS was launched in the 1990s and collects the most comprehen-
sive information on deaths in China. From 1991 to 2000, data were
collected at 145 representative locations nationwide. From 2003, the
system was expanded to cover 161 urban districts and rural counties. The
DSPS was scaled up again in 2013 to cover 605 counties (283 rural
counties and 322 urban districts) with a population of 0.34 billion,
encompassing roughly a quarter of China’s total population, making it
highly representative for the whole country.10
In each DSP location, the local CDC is required to record and verify all
deaths that occurred in hospitals or at home. Each death is registered in
DSPS following a standard protocol. The death certiﬁcate contains
detailed information on gender, age, and cause of death, allowing us to
construct location-, gender-, and age-group speciﬁc cause-of-death mor-
tality rates. The DSPS collects death records only for local residents,
deﬁned as those who have lived in a DSP location for at least 6 months in
the past year.
In this study, we have access to all the death records (5 million) from
2013 to 2015. We use the logarithm of the number of deaths as the main
dependent variable. Age-adjusted mortality rate (number of deaths per
100 thousand people) is also used as a robustness check. Since the pop-
ulation structure change is negligible during our sample period, the two
measures yield similar estimates. Each cause of death is categorized as
either cardiorespiratory or non-cardiorespiratory. Cardiorespiratory
diseases include cardiac complaints, conventional respiratory diseases,
cerebrovascular dysfunction (mostly stroke), tracheal and bronchial in-
fections,
and
lung
cancers.
Other
causes
are
grouped
as
non-
cardiorespiratory. We expect that straw burning pollution has a larger
impact on cardiorespiratory mortality than on non-cardiorespiratory
mortality.
3.3. Pollution and weather data
Daily air quality data were collected from the records of 1650 local
monitoring stations and were averaged by month. Concentrations of ﬁne
particulate matter (PM2.5) were the key variable of interest, but data on
PM10, SO2 and NO2 were also collected.
Previous studies show that China’s air quality data were sometimes
manipulated because the central government attached high political
stakes to local air quality (e.g., Ghanem and Zhang, 2014). However, this
concern has been signiﬁcantly alleviated in recent years because the
Chinese government upgraded the air quality monitoring system to
measure ﬁner pollutants (such as PM2.5) and at the same time automated
the sampling and reporting process in 2013. Greenstone et al. (2019)
show that the new monitoring system makes it very difﬁcult to manip-
ulate the air pollution data, which has signiﬁcantly improved the data
quality. In addition, we focus on burning in the summer season, during
which the PM concentrations are relatively low.11 Local ofﬁcials have
little incentives to manipulate such data, because the political assessment
targets primarily the number of severely polluted days.
Daily weather conditions, including wind speed, wind direction,
relative humidity, precipitation, and temperature, were collected from
403 meteorological stations. We then average them by month and match
them with the DSP data. Wind can carry pollutants to other areas but also
can disperse them. Strong wind helps ﬁres spread. Higher humidity
might discourage ﬁres and result in less complete combustion. Rainfall
and temperature may also affect farmers’ burning decisions. We thus
include all of them as control variables.
3.4. Data matching and summary statistics
We aggregate all the datasets to the monthly level for subsequent
analysis, for three reasons. First, aggregating data to the monthly level
creates more variation in the number of straw ﬁres for each county.12
Second, using monthly data can better capture the cumulative effect of
air pollution in the medium run. As shown by many epidemiological
studies and a few recent economic studies, the impact of air pollution
tends to accumulate over time.13 The reason is that prolonged exposure
to air pollution can cause more complex cardiorespiratory diseases and
increase the size of the affected population. Using daily data may
signiﬁcantly under-estimate the air pollution effect. In a robustness
check, we also use the distributed lag models with up to 7-day lags of
straw burning as independent variables to instrument PM2.5 and ﬁnd that
the estimates are indeed smaller than the monthly estimates (Appendix
Table A1). Third, a known issue when running regressions using daily
data with many lagged dependent variables is that the estimated co-
efﬁcients can be noisy and tend to oscillate. This is because air pollution
levels are highly correlated in consecutive days, making it difﬁcult to
interpret speciﬁc coefﬁcients (see Barwick et al., 2018). Further incor-
porating the instrumental variables in such models is even more chal-
lenging both technically and computationally.
We then merged different datasets into one panel at the county-
month-year level from May 20 to July 20 each year from 2013 to
2015, during which straw burning data are monitored and veriﬁed by the
MEE. The DSPS counties were ﬁrst matched with the locations where air
quality data were collected. If a county had no monitoring station within
50 km of its center, that county was dropped from our analysis. If a
county had multiple monitoring stations within that range, the average
concentrations across all of the stations were used. Counties for which no
PM2.5 data were reported for more than a year were also dropped. The
9 For example, the average area of farmland leased per agricultural household
is 5 mu or 0.0033 km2 in China in 2015, which is smaller than the size of a ﬁre
pixel but is larger than the ﬁre area that can be detected. Source: http://opinion.

10 More details about the DSPS can be found in He et al. (2016) and Ebenstein
et al. (2017).
11 The air pollution levels are higher during the winter because China’s winter
heating system burns large amounts of coal. Given the relative low PM con-
centrations in summer, we may capture the health impact of PM at the lower
tail.
12 At the monthly level, the average number of straw ﬁres in a county is about
2. For the daily data, we see a large number of zeros even during the burning
seasons.
13 See, for example, Barwick et al. (2018), Cheung et al. (forthcoming), Costa
et al. (2017), Deryugina et al. (2019), Schwartz (2000), Zanobetti et al. (2002);

4weather data were matched with the DSPS data in a similar way. The
total number of straw ﬁres observed within 50 km of the geographic
center of each county was then tabulated by month.14 The average area
of a Chinese county is 3363 km2, covered by a radius of around 33 km.
We choose 50 km as the main speciﬁcation and explore other distances
from 35 km to 100 km as robustness checks. The ﬁnal balanced panel
covered 107 urban districts and 102 rural counties, with at least one
pollution monitoring site within 50 km from each county’s center. In
total, 390 out of the 605 DSPS counties were dropped due to lack of data
on PM2.5.
Table 1 reports descriptive statistics of the key variables, including
the number of straw ﬁres, air pollution concentrations, and the number of
deaths. There were 2540 straw ﬁres detected by the satellites during the
period studied, an average of two ﬁres within 50 km of each county’s
center. Straw ﬁres were equally distributed along different wind di-
rections, suggesting that wind patterns are largely random during the
burning seasons. Both urban districts and rural counties had straw
burning detected. The number of staw ﬁres was lower in the urban dis-
tricts. This is reasonable because the sown area is smaller in urban dis-
tricts than in rural counties.
Panel B of Table 1 reports the summary statistics for air pollution and
visibility (i.e., impaired visibility due to air pollution). The average PM2.5
concentration during summer burning seasons was around 49 μg/m3,
which is signiﬁcantly lower than other seasons. Rural counties have
slightly higher PM2.5 concentrations than urban districts during the
summer burning seasons. We also observe rural SO2 concentration is
higher, likely because rural households burn more coal for cooking and
heating than do urban households.
Panel C of Table 1 further summarizes the number of deaths by cause,
age and gender. Around two-thirds of the total deaths are caused by
cardiorespiratory diseases, and there are more deaths in rural areas
compared with urban areas. Nearly 80% of the deaths are among people
above 60 years old, and males account for around 58%. In addition,
China has a relatively low infant mortality rate among countries at a
similar development stage.15
The spatial distribution of straw burning and air quality is shown in
Fig. 1. Panel A shows that most of the straw ﬁres took place in Henan,
Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces in central China. Panel B
shows the average PM2.5 concentrations during the summer burning
season in 2013–2015. We can observe a strong positive correlation be-
tween the number of straw ﬁres and air pollution. In counties with more
straw ﬁres, PM2.5 concentrations were higher.
4. Empirical strategy
4.1. Baseline model
We start by estimating the impact of straw burning on air quality
using a ﬁxed-effects model:
PMit ¼ β0 þ β1burningit þ Xitθ þ τi þ πt þ ξit
(1)
where PMit denotes the PM2.5 concentration in county i in month t;
burningit is the total number of straw ﬁres detected within 50 km of the
center of county i in month t. Xit is a vector of weather variables: wind
speed,
wind
direction,
temperature,
precipitation,
and
relative
humidity.16 τi are county ﬁxed effects, and πt are year and month ﬁxed
effects. ξit are errors. The county ﬁxed effects control for time-invariant
confounders speciﬁc to a county, such as its natural endowments, crop
patterns and straw-burning culture. The year and month ﬁxed effects
further account for shocks common to all counties in a particular year or
month. Standard errors are two-way clustered at county and month level
to account for autocorrelations along these two dimensions.
We then estimate the impact of straw burning on health in a similar
way:
Healthit ¼ α0 þ α1burningit þ Xitϑ þ τi þ πt þ εit
(2)
where Healthit denotes the logarithm of the monthly number of deaths in
county i in month t.
Equations (1) and (2) also provide the basis for estimating the impact
of PM2.5 on health. We focus on PM because we ﬁnd that SO2 and NO2
were not signiﬁcantly related to straw burning (see Appendix Table A2),
which is consistent with the previous scientiﬁc evidence. PM can provoke
pulmonary inﬂammatory response, alter cardiac autonomic function, and
accelerate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We focus on PM2.5
rather than PM10 because existing epidemiological evidence suggests
that smaller particles pose a greater threat to human health than do larger
ones (e.g., Zanobetti and Schwartz, 2009). PM2.5 can penetrate deeper
into the lungs and enter the bloodstream due to its small size, and can be
quickly absorbed and create direct damage to the circulatory system
(e.g., Godleski et al., 2000).
Speciﬁcally, the number of straw ﬁres can be treated as the instru-
mental variable (IV) for PM2.5, and Equation (1) can serve as the ﬁrst
stage. The second stage estimation uses the following equation:
Healthit ¼ γ0 þ γ1d
PMit þ Xitρ þ τi þ πt þ μit
(3)
where d
PMit is the predicted PM2.5 concentrations from Equation (1).
County ﬁxed effects, year and month ﬁxed effects, and weather condi-
tions are all included as controls in both stages of IV.
4.2. Validity of the instrumental variable
In the baseline model, we control for county ﬁxed effects, month and
year ﬁxed effects, and local weather conditions. Intuitively, the impact of
straw burning is identiﬁed by changes in the number of straw ﬁres within
the same location across different harvesting seasons, holding weather
conditions constant. At this level, whether we can treat straw burning
variations as exogenous is debatable. Below, we discuss several possi-
bilities that may invalidate the instrument, and provide solutions to each.
The ﬁrst concern is that farmers’ burning decisions may depend on air
pollution levels. For example, is it possible that they reduce/increase
straw burning activities if they observe high pollution? We believe this is
highly unlikely. During our ﬁeld trips, we interviewed farmers about
their straw burning behaviors and very few of them acknowledged that
burning straw is a major contribution to air pollution. In fact, farmers
repeatedly stated that they had the right to burn straw and that such
activities should not be regulated. This is also documented by multiple
news articles.17 In addition, in Appendix Table A3, we investigate
whether pollution on the previous day affects current-day straw burning
(¼1 if there is at least one straw burning point) and ﬁnd no statistically
signiﬁcant associations.
The second concern, which is more likely, is that straw burning can be
affected by regulations that are endogenous to local pollution and health
14 We use the geographic centers rather than administrative centers to calcu-
late the number of straw ﬁres. This is because straw ﬁres take place in the
farmlands and our results are primarily driven by rural areas. In rural areas, the
majority of the population lives in the villages, which are far from the admin-
istrative center.
15 See https://data.unicef.org/for more details.
16 We follow Grange (2014) and measure monthly wind directions based on
daily wind directions and speed using the vector decomposition method. See
Grange (2014) for more details.
17 For example, Xinhua News report that farmers believe straw burning is not a
major contribution to regional air quality compared with industrial and vehicle
emissions, and they think it is unfair to prohibit straw burning to improve urban
air quality. For example: http://www.xinhuanet.com/energy/2015-10/22/
c_1116898554.htm.

5status. For example, governments that have strong incentives to improve
local ambient air quality may also have strong incentives to provide
better health care. If these efforts were correlated, we would overstate
the impact of straw burning on population health. To address this pos-
sibility, we use non-local straw burning as the instrumental variable and
estimate how burning outside a county’s boundary affects its air pollu-
tion and health. Because the county government can only regulate straw
burning within its jurisdiction, neighborhood counties’ straw burning
creates more exogenous variations in local air quality. To take into ac-
count the possibility that straw burning shocks to the economy may be
spatially correlated, we control for the number of local straw ﬁres when
using the number of non-local straw ﬁres as an instrument. As will be
discussed in the next section, using non-local burning as the instrument
generates almost identical estimates.
The third concern is that straw burning may be associated with
temporary income shocks that also affect human health. For example,
straw burning often takes place after harvesting, and harvesting can
create positive income shocks to farmers. Were such temporary income
increases important for health, we might under-estimate the air pollution
effect.
We try to address this concern in two ways. First, income shocks
should not affect different diseases in a way that coincides with the air
pollution effect. Existing literature documents that air pollution primarily
affects
cardiorespiratory
diseases
and
does
not
affect
non-
cardiorespiratory diseases, while the income effect does not follow this
pattern. We analyze different causes of death and ﬁnd that straw burning
indeed only increases cardiorespiratory mortality, implying the air
pollution effect is the channel. Second, we follow Rangel and Vogl (2019)
and leverage wind directions to shut down the income channel, if there is
any. Speciﬁcally, we deﬁne an upwind straw ﬁre as being located within
45 degrees of the daily prevailing wind (ﬁxed octants) calculated from a
wind rose in Fig. 2. Straw ﬁres in the opposite direction are deﬁned as
downwind ones. Presumably, upwind and downwind straw ﬁres will
contribute equally to any temporary income shocks (or any other
economic shocks related to straw burning), but upwind straw ﬁres would
create a larger air pollution impact than downwind ones.
The idea can be formalized by the following model. First, health is
determined by air pollution and income levels:
Healthit ¼ δ0 þ δ1PMit þ δ2Incomeit þ Xitθ þ τi þ πt þ ξit
(4)
where both PMit and Incomeit are endogenous. We can observe air
pollution but not income and our interest is to identify the impact of air
pollution (δ1) in this model.
Some straw ﬁres occur upwind of the county center, and some occur
downwind. We can separate the number of upwind straw ﬁres (Upwindit)
from downwind straw ﬁres (Downwindit) and estimate how they affect
pollution and income:
PMit ¼ β0 þ β1Upwindit þ β2Downwindit þ Xitθ þ τi þ πt þ uit
(5)
Incomeit ¼ α0 þ αUpwindit þ αDownwindit þ Xitθ þ τi þ πt þ vit
(6)
In Equation (5), upwind straw ﬁres and downwind straw ﬁres affect
air pollution asymmetrically. We expect upwind ﬁres to have a larger
impact on local air pollution than downwind ones, i.e. β1 > β2. In
contrast, in Equation (6), upwind and downwind ﬁres have the same
impact on income, i.e., the coefﬁcient of Upwindit is the same as the co-
efﬁcient of Downwindit. This is the key assumption of the model and we
think it is a reasonable assumption because the impact of straw burning
on income should not depend on wind direction.
Our data also allow us to estimate the following (reduced-form)
equation:
Healthit ¼ γ0 þ γ1Upwindit þ γ2Downwindit þ Xitθ þ τi þ πt þ wit
(7)
Because we do not have data on transitory income (unobservable to
researchers), we cannot estimate Equations (4) and (6). However, the
following four coefﬁcients can be estimated from the data: γ1, γ2, β1, and
β2.

Notes: Summary statistics of monthly straw burning, air pollution and number of deaths in 209 DSP counties are reported, including mean, standard deviation, minimum
and maximum values. The summer burning period includes May.20th-July.20th in 2013–2015.

6Based on Equations (4)–(7), we can derive the following Wald-type
estimate:
δ1 ¼ ðγ1  γ2Þ = ðβ1  β2Þ
(8)
In other words, we can isolate the impact of air pollution on health
using the four coefﬁcients estimated from Equations (5) and (7). The
estimation process proceeds as follows: (1) we ﬁrst construct the number
of upwind and downwind straw ﬁres within 50 km of a county in a
month; (2) we then estimate how upwind and downwind straw ﬁres
affect air pollution using Equation (5) and obtain bβ1, and bβ2; then esti-
mate how upwind and downwind straw ﬁres affect mortality using
Equation (7) and obtain bγ1 and bγ2; (3) and ﬁnally calculate bδ1 using
Equation (8).
The ﬁnal concern is that people may migrate to avoid air pollution

7exposure, which will cause potential misclassiﬁcation of death counts in
different areas.18 However, we believe this concern can be signiﬁcantly
alleviated in our setting for four reasons. First, China’s household
registration system, i.e., Hukou, imposes signiﬁcant costs for people to
migrate both across different cities and between rural and urban areas
within a city. Second, we focus on monthly variations in air pollution and
mortality and control for time ﬁxed effects in all regressions. Our ﬁndings
will only be affected if people migrate in response to the number of straw
ﬁres month by month. This seems highly unlikely because the cost of
frequent migration can be very high. Third, as mentioned, the DSP sys-
tem collects death records only for local residents, those who have lived
in a DSP location for at least 6 months in the past year. The death records
for frequent migrants, if any, would not be recorded by the system.
Finally and most importantly, as shown in Section 6.2, we ﬁnd little
evidence that individuals take avoidance behaviors against straw
burning pollution in the summer, when the average PM2.5 concentration
is relatively low.
5. Baseline results
5.1. Straw burning and air pollution
Table 2 summarizes the regression results from Equation (1). We use
PM2.5 concentrations as the outcome variable (the results using the log-
arithm of PM2.5 and other pollutants as the outcome variables are listed
in Appendix Table A2). In Column (1), only the county ﬁxed effects are
included. Column (2) further controls for year and month ﬁxed effects.
Column (3) includes county, year and month ﬁxed effects, as well as a set
of weather controls. We cluster the standard errors at the county and
month level (two-way clustering). Alternative ways of computing the
standard errors, such as clustering at the county level only, do not affect
the signiﬁcance level.
Columns (1)–(3) show that 10 additional straw ﬁres detected by
satellite are associated with a 4.4–5.0 μg/m3 increase in monthly PM2.5
concentrations. In Column (4), we also include lagged number of straw
ﬁres in the regression. We ﬁnd that previous month’s straw ﬁres do not
affect current month’s air pollution. This ﬁnding also helps rule out any
lagged effects of straw burning on pollution at the monthly level.
Columns (5)–(6) compare the effects of straw burning on PM2.5 in
urban districts and rural counties. We ﬁnd the impacts are similar in size.
This is likely because all the locations in our sample (include the rural
counties) are close to major cities where air quality information is
available.
The F-statistics from Cragg-Donald (1993) tests for weak instruments
show that straw burning is a strong instrument for PM2.5. Note that
adding year ﬁxed effects, month ﬁxed effects, and weather controls has
negligible impact on the point estimate of the straw burning effect. This is
encouraging, as it indicates that changes in straw burning are not
correlated with these ﬁxed effects and weather conditions.
5.2. Straw burning and death
In Panel A of Table 3, we report the relationship between straw
burning and death. We focus on three measures: the logarithms of the
total number of deaths in a month, cardiorespiratory deaths, and non-
cardiorespiratory deaths.
After controlling for the county, month and year ﬁxed effects and
weather conditions, we ﬁnd that a 10-point increase in the number of
straw ﬁres predicts a 1.56% increase in monthly deaths from all causes
and a 1.82% increase in cardiorespiratory deaths. Both estimates are
statistically signiﬁcant. Straw burning has no signiﬁcant impact on non-
cardiorespiratory deaths. This ﬁnding is consistent with previous ones
(e.g., Ebenstein et al., 2017; He et al., 2016) and suggests that air

8pollution is likely to be the causal factor for the excess mortality.
5.3. IV estimates on the impacts of PM2.5 on deaths
We estimate the impact of ﬁne particulate matter on monthly deaths
using straw burning as the instrumental variable for air pollution. The
results are reported in Panel B of Table 3. We ﬁnd that a 10 μg/m3 in-
crease in PM2.5 concentrations will lead to a 3.25% increase in all-cause
deaths; again, the size of the coefﬁcient is robust to the inclusion of
weather conditions. Similarly, the mortality effect is driven primarily by
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, suggesting that air pollution is
likely to be a causal factor.
For comparison, we also report the association between PM2.5 and
deaths, in Panel C of Table 3. We see that none of the coefﬁcients is
statistically signiﬁcant at the conventional level. In addition, the OLS
estimates are also substantially smaller than the IV estimates, suggesting
that OLS estimates are downward biased.
The estimated coefﬁcients using the IV approach were larger than
associational estimates provided by public health and epidemiological
studies in both developed and developing countries (e.g., Dockery et al.,
1993; Samoli et al., 2008; Shang et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2017; Zanobetti
and Schwartz, 2009; Zhou et al., 2015).19 Our IV estimates are, however,
quantitatively
close
to
those
of
several
recent
studies
using
quasi-experimental approaches to estimate the health impacts of air
pollution (e.g., Chen et al., 2013; Ebenstein et al., 2017; Fan et al., 2020;
He et al., 2016). These results conﬁrm that associational estimates can
signiﬁcantly under-estimate the air pollution effect.
6. Threats to baseline ﬁndings
In this section, we discuss multiple threats to our baseline IV results.
We ﬁrst estimate the health impact of air pollution using augmented
instruments and compare them with the baseline results. Our analyses
show that, while the simple IV (number of straw ﬁres within 50 km of a
county) is conceptually less appealing than the improved instruments,
the estimates from the simple IV are quantitatively similar to the esti-
mates from the improved instruments. In other words, the improved
instruments do not really add much to our understanding of the straw
burning impact. Second, we discuss how avoidance behaviors will affect
our ﬁndings. In one exercise, we include the visibility variable in the
model and do not ﬁnd it having any impact. In another exercise, we
examine how people search online for air ﬁlters and face masks and ﬁnd
that people do not respond to air pollution information during the
summer. Our conclusion is that avoidance behavior is not a serious
concern in our research context. Finally, we conduct a rich set of
robustness checks and show that our ﬁndings are not affected by some
decisions we make in the empirical analyses.
6.1. Results from augmented IVs
We report the regression results from the improved instruments in
Tables 4 and 5. In Table 4, we use non-local straw burning as the
instrumental variable for local air pollution, conditional on local burning.
We report the ﬁrst stage, reduced-form, and the IV estimates. We ﬁnd

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. The reduced-form esti-
mates, IV estimates, and OLS estimates are reported in Panels A, B, and C,
respectively. Columns (1)–(2) examine the effects of pollution on percentage
change in monthly all-cause mortality. Columns (3)–(4) and Columns (5)–(6)
examine the effects on cardiorespiratory and non-cardiorespiratory mortality,
respectively. Weather variables include wind speed, wind direction, precipita-

19 For example, Shang et al. (2013) reviewed 33 studies in China and found
that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 increases total, respiratory, and cardiovascular
mortality by 0.38%, 0.51%, and 0.44%, respectively. Zhou et al. (2015) have
provided the only rural estimates of the impacts of outdoor air pollution,
showing that each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 1.2% and a
0.55% increase in mortality risk in two Chinese counties.

9that non-local burning is the primary contributor to the elevation in
PM2.5 concentrations in a given county, as shown in Columns (1) and (2).
This is likely because over 88% of the total number of straw ﬁres
occurred within the 50-km radius of a county are non-local. A 10 μg/m3
increase in PM2.5 concentrations will increase mortality by 3.27%–3.75%
(Columns (5) and (6)). These estimates are essentially the same as the
baseline estimates in Table 3.
In Table 5, we summarize the results from estimating Equations (5),
(7) and (8). In Columns (1) and (2), we see that upwind straw ﬁres indeed
have a larger impact on air quality than do downwind straw ﬁres. In
Columns (3) and (4), we ﬁnd a similar pattern: upwind ﬁres cause more
people to die than do downwind ﬁres. Both sets of results are robust to
the inclusion of time-varying weather controls. In the last two columns,
we estimate the impact of pollution on mortality using differences in the
coefﬁcients between upwind and downwind straw ﬁres. We ﬁnd that a
10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentrations will increase deaths by 4.47%.
The estimates are slightly larger than those in Table 3, but the differences
are statistically insigniﬁcant.20
Our interpretation of these results is that, although conceptually there
are good reasons to worry about the endogeneity of straw burning, this
concern matters very little in reality. In subsequent heterogeneity anal-
ysis, we thus focus on estimates from the baseline IV model. In addition,
the baseline IV estimates are marginally more conservative than the
alternative IV estimates, so when we use the baseline estimates to eval-
uate the potential gains from controlling straw burning, the beneﬁt es-
timate would be interpreted as the lower bound.
6.2. Avoidance behavior
Avoidance or defensive behaviors can complicate the interpretations
of the estimated impacts of air pollution. If people take measures to
reduce exposure, such as reducing outdoor activities or using air ﬁlters,
the true physiological impact of pollution will be under-estimated (e.g.,
Moretti and Neidell, 2011).
There are three reasons why we think avoidance behavior does not
play an important role in our setting. First, we examine the visibility data
and ﬁnd that including visibility as a control in the regression has no
impact on the air pollution effect (Panel A of Table 6). We also estimate
the relationship between visibility and straw burning and ﬁnd that straw
burning does not signiﬁcantly degrade visibility (Appendix Table A2).
Second, we use data in the summer season, when there are better
meteorological conditions for pollutant dispersion, and the average
PM2.5 concentrations are relatively low. Pollution alerts are rarely trig-
gered during the summer, so we expect that people undertake little
avoidance behavior. To test this idea, we estimate the impact of straw
burning on individuals’ online searches for defensive equipment, using
the Baidu Search Index. Baidu Search Index is analogous to Google
Trends and tells us how many people search for certain keywords within
a certain period of time in cities. Previous studies show that online search
activities for “anti-PM2.5 mask,” “haze,” “PM2.5” and “Air Quality Index”
(AQI) are very sensitive to air pollution and strongly correlated with
online sales of defensive equipment (e.g., Liu et al., 2018). As reported in
Panel B of Table 6, we ﬁnd that straw burning does not affect any of these
searches during the summer seasons on which we focus. In contrast, in
the winter season when air quality is poorer, people are more likely to
search more for these items when straw burning increases.21
Our conclusion is that the public is not quite aware of pollution in the
summer, so our estimates are unlikely to be confounded by avoidance
behaviors in a meaningful way.
6.3. Robustness checks
We conduct a variety of robustness checks to address some other is-
sues related to our baseline ﬁndings. First, one reasonable concern about
the satellite-detected straw burning data is that thick clouds may cover
small ﬁres, which will result in measurement errors in the explanatory
variable. We thus directly include cloud coverage in the regression and
check whether the estimates are affected. The results are reported in
Column (3) of Appendix Table A4. We ﬁnd that controlling for cloud
coverage yields similar IV estimates, suggesting that the number of days

20 The 95% conﬁdence interval of the baseline estimate, 3.25%, is [0.45%,
6.06%], which contains all the point estimates in Tables 4 and 5.
21 We also use data for “bottled water” as a placebo, and ﬁnd that it is not
related to short-run variations of pollution and straw burning for either summer
or winter.

10with thick clouds is largely random, conditional on location and time
ﬁxed effects.22
Second, we control for SO2 and NOx in the regression and ﬁnd that the
PM2.5 estimates remain robust. This ﬁnding suggests that changes in
PM2.5 concentrations, induced by straw burning, are indeed not corre-
lated with changes in SO2 and NOx. The results are reported in Column
(4) of Appendix Table A4.
Third, instead of using the logarithm of the number of deaths as the
outcome, we use the standardized mortality rate based on death and
census data as an alternative outcome. The results are reported in Ap-
pendix Table A5. The standardized mortality rate is deﬁned as the age-
adjusted number of deaths per 100 thousand people.23 We get consis-
tent results using this alternative measure. If monthly straw burning in-
creases by 10 points, all-cause and cardiorespiratory mortality rates will
increase respectively by 1.71% and 1.91%. The IV estimates show that a
10 μg/m3 increase in monthly PM2.5 will lead to a 3.57% and a 4.00%
increase in all-cause and cardiorespiratory mortality rates, respectively.
Fourth, we use the log of (1 þ the number of straw ﬁres) as the
explanatory variable to estimate the effect of a percentage change in
straw burning on mortality. The results are reported in Appendix
Table A6. We ﬁnd that a 10% increase in monthly straw burning in a
county will increase all-cause deaths by 0.09%. The effect is driven pri-
marily by extra deaths from cardiorespiratory diseases, consistent with
the main ﬁndings.
Fifth, we include polynomial terms of the number of straw ﬁres and
weather conditions to explore whether there is any nonlinear effect of
straw burning and weather. Appendix Table A7 represents the estimates
with the quadratic term of straw burning. Straw burning’s effect on
deaths is slightly concave, with a turning point of around 40. Given that
the average monthly number of straw ﬁres in a county is 2 (with a
standard deviation of 8) in our data, the health effect of straw burning
can be well-approximated by a linear function. In addition, in Appendix
Table A8, we follow Desch^enes and Greenstone (2011) and use 5 tem-
perature bins, namely (,15), [15,20), [20,25), [25,30), and [30), to
control for temperature nonlinearly, and the estimates remain robust.
Sixth, we include the number of previous month’s straw ﬁres in the
regression and try to examine potential lagged effects. The results are
reported in Appendix Table A9. We see that the lagged burning variable
is statistically insigniﬁcant in all regressions.
Seventh, in Appendix Table A10, we summarize the results using
different matching distances between monitoring stations and counties.
We ﬁnd the results are quantitatively similar using alternative ways to
match the DSP locations and air quality.
Finally, our main speciﬁcation merges all data using the geometric
county centers. Alternatively, we can match all data sets using the
administrative centers. The results are reported in Appendix Table A11.
We ﬁnd a consistent impact of straw burning on all-cause deaths through
cardiorespiratory diseases. The IV estimates are also similar in size to our
baseline ﬁndings.
7. Heterogeneity
The health effects of burning straw can differ among subpopulations,
as different individuals may have distinct exposures or physical responses
to air pollution. We explore the health effects of straw burning by loca-
tion, gender, and age in Table 7.
Panel A compares the relative health risk between urban districts and
rural counties. We ﬁnd that, although straw burning degrades both urban
and rural air quality, residents in rural counties are more likely to be
affected. Speciﬁcally, if the number of monthly straw ﬁres increases by
10, all-cause mortality will increase by 2.52% in rural areas, but there is
no signiﬁcant relationship for the urban areas. The IV estimates of PM2.5
are consistent with the reduced-form estimates using straw burning.
Column (4) shows that a 6.69% increase in mortality is associated with a
10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 in rural areas, while there is no impact of
pollution caused by straw burning on mortality in the urban areas. Panel
B further distinguishes lower-income areas from higher-income areas
based on the median GDP per capita in 2012.24 We ﬁnd a similar pattern:
the health impact is concentrated in areas with lower incomes.

Notes: Each cell represents a separate regression. Panel A summarizes the IV estimates with/without visibility as control. In Panel B, dependent variables include Baidu
Search Indices for anti-PM2.5 mask, haze, PM2.5, AQI and bottled water. We separately estimate the impact of straw burning on these outcomes for summer and winter.
Location (county or city), month and year ﬁxed effects, and weather conditions (wind speed, wind direction, temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity) are
always controlled. Standard errors in parentheses are two-way clustered at county/city and month level. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.
22 Note that, if it was raining, there would be no measurement errors in straw
burning because there is no burning on rainy days.
23 We do not use the age-adjusted mortality results as the main outcome, for
two reasons. First, population data for different age groups in different years
need to be interpolated from the census data, which are only available every ﬁve
years. So, conceptually it may increase inaccuracy in the health measure when
we adjust the age structure. Second, as a practical matter, we use monthly
changes in pollution/death within the same location for a given year for iden-
tiﬁcation, so it does not matter whether we adjust the age structure (as it only
rescales the outcome by population structure in a year).
24 There are 42 urban districts and 66 rural counties in the lower-income
group, and there are 66 urban districts and 41 rural counties in the higher-
income group.

11While this study is unable to pin down the exact channels through
which the air pollution effect is mitigated in urban/richer areas, a
growing line of literature suggests that the quality of medical services,
availability of air pollution information, and defensive investment are
possible factors. For example, Cheung et al. (2020) show that the impact
of air pollution on mortality depends in part on whether the residents
have immediate access to emergency services. When air pollution trig-
gers a heart attack or an acute respiratory disease, immediate treatment
is critical to save a patient’s life. In Barwick et al. (2019), the researchers
ﬁnd that access to pollution information dramatically increased house-
holds’ awareness about pollution and signiﬁcantly reduced mortality
caused by pollution. As air pollution information is largely unavailable in
rural/poorer areas, it is not surprising that rural/poorer residents are
more vulnerable to air pollution. Finally, as shown by Sun et al. (2017)
and Ito and Zhang (2020), individuals’ defensive investments in face
masks and air ﬁlters depend not only on the air pollution level, but also
on their income. Poor people are much less likely to invest in defensive
equipment, which may signiﬁcantly increase their exposure.
We are not alone in highlighting the signiﬁcant urban-rural hetero-
geneity in the air pollution effect. Zhou et al. (2015) and Fan et al. (2020)
observe similar patterns in their studies, while they use different
identiﬁcation strategies and focus on different research contexts. The
sharp contrast between urban and rural areas indicates that previous
studies, which focus mostly on urban residents, may understate the
health cost of air pollution.
Panel C of Table 7 summarizes our ﬁndings by gender. We ﬁnd that
the mortality risk associated with straw burning is more signiﬁcant for
males.25 This is generally consistent with the public health literature, as
males in China are more likely to smoke and thus have compromised
cardiorespiratory functions. Males are also more likely to work in the
farmlands, which further increases their exposure to air pollution.
Panel D of Table 7 reports the results for different age groups: 0 (in-
fants), those between 1 and 4, those between 5 and 19, those between 20
and 39, those between 40 and 59, and those above 60 years old. We ﬁnd
that a 10-point increase in the monthly number of straw ﬁres was asso-
ciated with a 1.53% increase in mortality for people above 60. Mean-
while, middle-aged people are also vulnerable to air pollution caused by
straw burning. We estimate that, if the number of monthly straw ﬁres
increases by 10, the mortality risk for people between 40 and 59 will
increase by 3.07%. This result is somewhat surprising, as existing liter-
ature typically ﬁnds that air pollution has a greater impact on the elderly
(e.g., He et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2020). Our interpretation of these results
is that, because rural middle-aged people are still a major labor force in
the farmlands, their exposure to straw burning pollution can be greater
than other groups. The ambient air pollution concentration in the county
may understate this group’s actual exposure to air pollution.
Straw burning does not signiﬁcantly predict mortality among those
below 40 years old, including infants. The null effect on the infant group
also surprises us, as many studies show that infants are vulnerable to air
pollution (e.g., Arceo et al., 2016; Chay and Greenstone, 2003; Currie and
Neidell, 2005). Nevertheless, this result is consistent with Rangel and
Vogl (2019), who show that air pollution from agricultural ﬁres increases
the likelihood of stillbirth but has no impact on infant mortality. Their
argument is that infants at the highest risk for postnatal mortality might
have been selected out before they were born, i.e., there may exist a
survivor bias when studying infant mortality. As we do not have data for
stillbirths or other measures of infant health, we are unable to further test
this argument.26
The IV estimates show similar patterns. The effects of PM2.5 are large
and statistically signiﬁcant for people over 40 years old. People below 40
are unlikely to die from air pollution caused by straw burning.
8. Straw recycling
In 2016, the central government of China enforced an incentive-based
policy that subsidizes individuals and enterprises that recycled straw
from the ﬁeld.27 The top 10 provinces with the most intensive straw
burning activities each received 100 million Chinese yuan (around 14.2
million USD) in 2016 to recycle straw. These provinces are Henan, Anhui,
Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jilin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shanxi and
Inner Mongolia. The subsidy’s objective is to improve air quality by
incentivizing farmers to recycle straw instead of burning it. The policy
continued in 2017 the total amount of subsidy increased to 1.3 billion
Chinese yuan (around 186 million USD).
We examine how this subsidy program affects straw burning using a

Panel B compares rich and poor areas separated by the median of GDP per capita

wind direction, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity) are controlled.
Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by county and month. ***p < 0.01,

25 We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the air pollution impact on males is
greater than that on females.
26 Nevertheless, the results for the infant group should be interpreted with
caution. A known issue in the DSP reporting process is that infant deaths are
more likely to be under-reported. While the Chinese CDC has been conducting
retrospective surveys to determine under-reporting rates in different DSP loca-
tions, such adjustments are only available at the yearly level. It is unclear to use
whether under-reporting of infant deaths differs across months.

12Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach:
Yit ¼ α þ β*subsidyit þ γ*Xit þ μi þ πt þ εit
(7)
where Yit is the number of burning points or the PM concentrations in
province i in year t. Each “year” is deﬁned by the two straw burning
seasons, from May 20 to July 20 and from September 20 to November 20,
a total of 124 days. subsidyit is a dummy variable equal to 1 if province i
received a subsidy in year t. Xit is a vector of meteorological conditions,
including wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity,
and precipitation. μi and πt control for province and year ﬁxed effects. β is
the key parameter of interest. It estimates the effect of straw recycling
subsidy on the number of straw ﬁres or air quality.
The identifying assumption of the above model is that the treated
provinces and untreated provinces should follow a parallel trend before
2016. To formally test the parallel trend assumption, we use an event-
study approach following Jacobson et al. (1993) and estimate the dif-
ference in the number of straw ﬁres between the two groups before and
after 2016. We use 2015 as the reference year and compare the changes
in the number of straw burning points between the two groups in other
years relative to 2015. The estimates are plotted in Panel A of Fig. 3.
While we observe a slight downward trend before 2015, none of the
coefﬁcients before 2015 are statistically signiﬁcant. After the program
was introduced, i.e., for 2016, we see a dramatic decline in the number of
straw ﬁres in the subsidized provinces. The effect remained positive and
statistically signiﬁcant in 2017. The corresponding event-study regres-
sion results are reported in Appendix Table A12.
Table 8 summarizes the regression results. Column (1) reports the
baseline DiD result, where only province and year ﬁxed effects are
included. Column (2) further controls for weather conditions. In Column
(3), we add a time trend that allows the treated provinces to evolve
differently from the control provinces. This speciﬁcation aims to address
the concern that the treated and control provinces may not completely
follow a parallel trend before 2016, as illustrated by the slight downward
trend in Fig. 3. In Column (4), we further control for a set of province-
speciﬁc time trends, allowing each province to have a different trend.
With this most restrictive speciﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the annual number
of straw ﬁres in the subsidized provinces on average dropped by 153
since 2016 compared with provinces without subsidies. The less
demanding speciﬁcations in Columns (1) to (3) generate slightly larger
but quantitatively similar estimates. In Column (5), we use the logarithm
of the number of straw ﬁres as the outcome variable and ﬁnd that the
number of straw ﬁres decreased by 28.8% (e0.339-1).

13In Panel B of Fig. 3, we repeat the event-study analysis for PM2.5. We
focus on 2013 to 2017, as PM2.5 was not monitored in most parts of China
before 2013. We expect that the changes in PM2.5 levels would follow the
same pattern as changes in straw ﬁres because straw burning primarily
emits particulates. Indeed, we observe that the PM2.5 levels fell signiﬁ-
cantly in 2016, and this reduction remained statistically signiﬁcant in
2017, implying that straw burning reduction causally improved air
quality. In Column (6) of Table 8, we report the impact of straw recycling
subsidy on PM2.5 using the most restrictive speciﬁcation. We ﬁnd that
straw burning subsidy decreased the PM2.5 concentrations in the treated
provinces by 4.33 μg/m3 during the straw burning seasons. Column (7)
further reports the results for PM10 for comparison. The subsidy reduced
PM10 concentrations by 9.87 μg/m3. In Columns (8) and (9), we ﬁnd no
impact of the subsidy on the concentrations of SO2 nor NO2. This is in line
with the scientiﬁc literature and further enhances the credibility of our
ﬁndings.28
The signiﬁcant drops in both straw burning and PM2.5 have important
implications for public health in China. We can conduct a back-of-the-
envelope calculation to compare the beneﬁts and costs of the policy.
The mortality rate of the 10 treated provinces was 6.41 per thousand in
2015, and the total population of the 10 provinces was 614.2 million. To
simplify the calculation, assuming that the incidence of deaths is equally
distributed throughout the year, so the total number of deaths during the
straw burning seasons would have been around 1.34 million in 2015.
According to the IV estimate in Section 5.3, a 10 μg/m3 change in PM2.5
predicts a 3.25% change in mortality. That implies that a 4.33 μg/m3
reduction in mean PM2.5 concentrations during the burning seasons
would bring down the mortality rate by 1.41%, equivalent to averting
roughly 18,900 premature deaths annually.29 Note that in this calcula-
tion, we assume that the subsidies affect individuals’ health only through
its impacts on straw burning pollution. We cannot fully rule out the
possibility that the subsidy may directly improve health through the
income channel, as farmers’ budget constraints can be relieved by the
subsidy.
We can monetize the health beneﬁt using the value of statistical life
(VSL). Since straw burning has a negligible effect on urban residents, the
cost of premature death is estimated for rural residents only. Fan et al.
(2020) suggested using 2.92 million Chinese yuan (about 440,000 USD)
as the VSL for a typical Chinese rural resident. The health beneﬁt from
reduced mortality is estimated to be about 55 billion Chinese yuan
(around 7.85 billion USD).
For the cost estimate, we look at three components: (1) the total
amount of subsidy, (2) additional work to enforce the policy and
encourage farmers to recycle straw, and (3) potential changes in agri-
cultural production. The ﬁrst component is straightforward: the gov-
ernment provided 1 billion Chinese yuan (142 million USD) in 2016 and
1.3 billion Chinese yuan (186 million USD) in 2017 to encourage farmers
to recycle straw. The second cost component is more difﬁcult to estimate,
as we do not have data on how much additional work is needed to
implement the policy. However, we believe the additional administrative
cost did not exceed 1 billion yuan in 2016 and did not exceed 1.3 billion
yuan in 2017. This is because, if the additional work alone had been more
costly than the total amount of subsidy, the policy would not have been
implemented. Adding these two components together, the upper-bound
of the policy’s cost would be less than 2.6 billion Chinese yuan each
year (1.3 billion direct subsidies þ 1.3 billion for additional adminis-
trative work).
To estimate the third cost component, we examine whether the sub-
sidy affects the total yield of agriculture and total grain output (the most
important type of crop output in China). The concern here is that if in-
dividuals were incentivized to engage more in agricultural production
(because of the higher value of agriculture), the cost of the policy could
be unintendedly larger. However, as reported in Appendix Table A13, we
ﬁnd that the subsidy does not affect agricultural output. Given this, we
conclude that the third cost component should be small in magnitude,
and therefore we leave it out of our cost calculation.
If we compare the beneﬁt of controlling straw burning (55 billion
Chinese yuan or 18,900 averted deaths) with the cost of subsidizing
straw recycling (at most 2.6 billion Chinese yuan per year), we see that
the beneﬁt from reduced mortality alone is an order of magnitude larger
than the cost. To put these numbers in another way, it costs at most
137,600 Chinese yuan (19,700 USD) to avert a premature death when
the government subsidizes straw recycling. While these calculations are
coarse, the signiﬁcant difference in their magnitudes suggests that there
would be signiﬁcant welfare gains from controlling straw burning.
Note that improved air quality would also reduce morbidity, help
individuals save on defensive expenditures on air ﬁlters and facial masks,
increase labor productivity, and bring about co-beneﬁts for the climate.
Existing studies show that the beneﬁts along these dimensions are also
substantial (e.g., Barwick et al., 2018; Chang et al., 2019; Ito and Zhang,

Notes: Each column represents a separate regression. Columns (1)–(4) list the effect of straw recycling subsidy on the number of straw ﬁres in a province during straw
burning seasons in a year. Column (5) uses the logarithm of the number straw ﬁres as the dependent variable. Columns (6)–(9) report the effects of the straw recycling
subsidy on air pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2. Province and year ﬁxed effects are always controlled. Weather conditions include wind speed, wind
direction, temperature, precipitation, relative humidity. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by province and year. ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1.
28 As a set of placebo tests, we run the same set of regressions using air
pollution measures during the non-burning seasons. We ﬁnd no difference in air
quality between the subsidized provinces and the non-subsidized provinces
during the non-burning seasons, as reported in Appendix Table A13 (Columns
(1) to (4)). This alleviates the concern that other agricultural or pollution pol-
icies targeted at the subsidized provinces may confound the DiD estimates, or
that the two groups of provinces are systematically different in other ways. In
fact, we are unaware of any other policy in company with the straw-recycling
subsidy that was applied to the same set of provinces in 2016.
29 The mortality data in 2016 are unavailable for use in this project. Hence, the
time windows for mortality estimation and policy evaluation are different.

expect the gain from controlling straw burning to be even greater.
9. Conclusions
This paper investigates the impacts of agricultural straw burning on
air pollution and mortality in China. We estimate that a 10-point increase
in the number of straw burns detected by satellites in a county in a month
will lead to a 7.62% increase in monthly PM2.5 concentrations and a
1.56% increase in deaths. Straw burning primarily causes people to die
from cardiorespiratory diseases. Using straw burning as an instrument for
PM2.5, we further estimate that a 10 μg/m3 change in PM2.5 will cause a
3.25% change in mortality and 3.80% change in cardiorespiratory mor-
tality, which are similar in magnitude to previous estimates on the im-
pacts of air pollution in China. Using alternative instruments (non-local
straw burning and wind directions) generates quantitatively similar es-
timates, supporting the causal interpretation of our ﬁndings.
The health impacts of straw burning are highly heterogeneous. Spe-
ciﬁcally, the effects are greater in rural and poor areas than in urban and
rich areas, suggesting better socio-economic conditions can mitigate the
impact of air pollution on mortality. Straw burning mainly impairs the
health of middle-aged and elderly people, so those who are more
vulnerable and are more intensively exposed to the straw burning smoke
are more likely to die due to straw burning.
Overall, these ﬁndings highlight the large health cost of straw burning
and the need for more effective regulatory efforts. Exploiting China’s
straw recycling policy, we further show that providing subsidies to
farmers and enterprises incentivized them to recycle straw, which
signiﬁcantly reduced air pollution caused by straw burning. Our
exploratory analysis suggests that the beneﬁts of subsidizing straw
recycling are substantially larger than the costs. Other countries that
facing similar problems may consider adopting similar policies.
Note that in this study we are only able to quantify the short-term
health impacts of straw burning pollution on mortality. Presumably,
accumulated exposure to air pollution would cause larger health dam-
ages to individuals (e.g. Ebenstein et al., 2017). That implies, the po-
tential beneﬁts from controlling straw burning would be even greater if
the straw recycling can be sustained. Future research is warranted to
better understand the welfare implications of these regulations in the
long run.

Abstract: The escalating crisis of environmental degradation, with waste ﬁres acting as a potent accel-
erant, has reached a critical juncture that demands immediate attention. This crisis disproportionately
affects developing and low-income nations, where unregulated disposal and incineration in open
areas have become rampant. These open waste ﬁres serve as hotbeds for many environmental hazards
ranging from air and water pollution to soil degradation. In addition, they contribute to the growing
threat of marine litter and are a signiﬁcant source of greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating global
climate change. Beyond their environmental toll, waste ﬁres present an immediate and long-term
threat to human health, causing respiratory problems and skin conditions and potentially leading
to more serious health outcomes, such as cancer. Their impacts are multidimensional, affecting
not only the environment but also pose severe health risks to communities, especially those near
waste-burning sites. In this technologically advanced era, the application of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI),
Machine Learning (ML), and deep learning technologies has the potential to revolutionize waste ﬁre
management. These technologies can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of identifying, monitoring,
and ultimately mitigating waste ﬁres, making them indispensable tools in the ﬁght against this com-
plex issue. This article offers a comprehensive and in-depth examination of the historical evolution of
waste ﬁres, with the aim of shedding light on the critical factors that contribute to their occurrence.
We explore the scientiﬁc mechanisms by which waste ﬁres lead to environmental pollution and
public health crises, providing a holistic understanding of their far-reaching impacts. We present
an overview of signiﬁcant research initiatives, policy interventions, and technological solutions that
have been proposed or implemented by authoritative bodies around the world. By synthesizing
existing research and offering new insights, this paper aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of
the intricacies of waste ﬁres and spur innovative solutions for their sustainable management and
eventual eradication. Therefore, this article focuses on environmental and human health problems
while outlining the comprehensive approach and potential contributions to solving this critical issue.
Keywords: air pollution; climate change; greenhouse gas (GHG); particulate matter (PM); soil
pollution; waste ﬁres
1. Introduction
Waste ﬁres occur because of the intentional and unintentional burning of waste sub-
stances, such as plastics, food items, garbage, or other waste materials. These ﬁres might
produce harmful pollutants and chemicals in the environment, causing a threat to the
atmosphere and public health. Waste ﬁres are also waste resources and can spread fast,
posing a threat to surrounding spaces. The incidents of waste ﬁres are becoming a ma-
jor and growing problem in several countries, leading to critical health and atmospheric
problems [1]. Waste ﬁres generally arise when waste, such as household garbage, is burnt
without taking appropriate measures, often generating gases and chemicals into the en-
vironment. This is most dangerous in areas with a dense population, where the impacts

of waste ﬁres can spread quickly, causing damage or harm to the atmosphere and public
health, raising signiﬁcant awareness among people affected by the unfortunate health and
socioeconomic impacts of waste ﬁres [2]. Waste ﬁres have been considered to harm public
health basically by increasing ambient exposure to dangerous chemicals [3]. The impacts
of waste ﬁres might be described into two main parts: deliberate and accidental. Waste
ﬁres of the deliberate type are generally set by humans looking to throw off their wastage
rapidly and cheaply. In addition, accidental waste ﬁres generally occur due to carelessness,
such as the butt of a cigarette thrown into a trash bin or the storage of waste materials near
a heat source [4].
The effects on the environment and people’s health of waste ﬁres are far-reaching
and could have long-term consequences. Waste ﬁres produce toxic gases and chemicals
into the climate, including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide.
Burning biomass waste materials releases heavy toxic air, soil, and water, such as volatile
organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic chemicals. These pollutants might have a
critical effect on the health of the elderly, pregnant women, and children, who are more
sensitive to the dangerous impacts of air pollution. Additionally, exposure to the smoke
generated by this incident would cause headaches, eye irritation, and even nausea. There
are a total of 339,000 premature deaths per year that could be ascribed to vulnerability to
waste ﬁre smoke through the increased risk of diseases related to the respiratory system,
such as hypertension, asthma, respiratory infections, and cardiac arrest [1,4–7]. It is also
responsible for global warming, which is expected to improve as heavy heat strokes are
faster. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the health and environmental issues
of waste ﬁres is critical to obstructing the related burden of these diseases. Figure 1 shows
the Venn diagram representing the local, regional, and global impacts of waste ﬁres.

without taking appropriate measures, often generating gases and chemicals into the envi-
ronment. This is most dangerous in areas with a dense population, where the impacts of 
waste ﬁres can spread quickly, causing damage or harm to the atmosphere and public 
health, raising signiﬁcant awareness among people aﬀected by the unfortunate health and 
socioeconomic impacts of waste ﬁres [2]. Waste ﬁres have been considered to harm public 
health basically by increasing ambient exposure to dangerous chemicals [3]. The impacts 
of waste ﬁres might be described into two main parts: deliberate and accidental. Waste 
ﬁres of the deliberate type are generally set by humans looking to throw oﬀ their wastage 
rapidly and cheaply. In addition, accidental waste ﬁres generally occur due to careless-
ness, such as the butt of a cigarette thrown into a trash bin or the storage of waste materials 
near a heat source [4]. 
The eﬀects on the environment and people’s health of waste ﬁres are far-reaching 
and could have long-term consequences. Waste ﬁres produce toxic gases and chemicals 
into the climate, including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monox-
ide. Burning biomass waste materials releases heavy toxic air, soil, and water, such as vol-
atile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic chemicals. These pollutants might have 
a critical eﬀect on the health of the elderly, pregnant women, and children, who are more 
sensitive to the dangerous impacts of air pollution. Additionally, exposure to the smoke 
generated by this incident would cause headaches, eye irritation, and even nausea. There 
are a total of 339,000 premature deaths per year that could be ascribed to vulnerability to 
waste ﬁre smoke through the increased risk of diseases related to the respiratory system, 
such as hypertension, asthma, respiratory infections, and cardiac arrest [1,4–7]. It is also 
responsible for global warming, which is expected to improve as heavy heat strokes are 
faster. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the health and environmental issues 
of waste ﬁres is critical to obstructing the related burden of these diseases. Figure 1 shows 
the Venn diagram representing the local, regional, and global impacts of waste ﬁres.

The incident of ﬁre in waste is common in all parts of waste recycling and affects
every business that is responsible for the collection, sorting, reassessment, recycling, trans-
portation, and recovery of energy from waste materials. Management of ﬁre risk in wasteSustainability 2023, 15, 14241

facilities is necessary. This is because waste disposal facilities represent a necessary social
function, and ﬁre incidents in the facilities of waste management facilities could impact
the entire society. By circumventing the risk of ﬁres, obstructions in generation could be
avoided in nearby businesses and waste facilities. Obstructing ﬁre risk in waste facilities
and controlling it in a real way can also provide assistance for the sustainability of the
environment with fewer discharges into the air and minimize the consequences for the
residents in the community [8,9]. One of the biggest challenges in waste management is
a random ﬁre that causes numerous problems for the companies of waste management
companies. Various causes are responsible for the ignition of ﬁre in waste management,
such as human error, improper waste storage, friction, and technical or electrical failure.
Incidents of waste ﬁres are gradually becoming major forerunners of wildﬁres, although
previously, accounting for environmental and socioeconomic cripples of both is executed
in separation from each other, without caring about the effect of their compound [10]. It
is necessary to take measures to prevent waste ﬁres from occurring due to the increasing
serious health and environmental impacts of waste ﬁres. The best way to reduce waste ﬁres
is through appropriate waste management, involving the waste separation into multiple
categories, such as non-organic and organic waste, and assuring that it is accurately dis-
posed of through compost, recycling, or other types of waste management. Thus, the risk
of ﬁre from waste could be reduced with proper waste management, and it is also helpful
to decrease the amount of garbage that is ﬁlled up on the landﬁll site.
The burning of crop residue is also considered waste ﬁres and is the biggest problem
in developing countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. Determined global
projections and scenarios are used to estimate long-term food security at the global level in
an area of socio-economic and environmental change scenarios (see Table 1). One of the
major problems today the world deals with is the scarcity of food items for the rapidly
growing population of humans [11]. To meet the current and prospective demand for food,
the agricultural ﬁeld needs to produce more food grains. As the area, quantity, and number
of food grains grown have increased rapidly in recent years, crop residual management is a
serious challenge.

The residual burning produces various environmental problems. Recently, air quality
in the northern part of India was severely affected due to the burning of agricultural waste
generated after harvesting rice crops, which happens every year [20]. Due to the lack of
efﬁcient and affordable agricultural waste removal techniques, farmers are burning crop
residues in open environments to clean the area and prepare for the next crop [21]. Figure 2
shows the haze and fog that occurred in the northern part of India due to the open burning
of agricultural waste. One of the biggest environmental problems facing humanity is waste
management [22]. Fire in garbage facilities is a serious problem that occurs regularly and
has several negative effects on the environment. Previous research has demonstrated that
high levels of pollution are created as a result of ﬁres in municipal trash. Additionally,
combating ﬁres that start in garbage storage facilities is typically difﬁcult. Some of the
causes are the abundance of ﬁre hazards and the large volume of fuel accessible in sanitary
landﬁlls [23]. Therefore, ﬁres in garbage facilities can cause considerable environmentalSustainability 2023, 15, 14241

damage. Due to the high emissions over an extended period of time, it can have an impact
on nearby residential areas and other social functions. Ecology can be negatively impacted
by smoke emissions along with the surge of damping water.

it can have an impact on nearby residential areas and other social functions. Ecology can 
be negatively impacted by smoke emissions along with the surge of damping water.

The Previous Review Works 
The problem of waste is a global one that is unlikely to be solved. According to the 
World Bank report, the levels of solid waste generation have recently increased and are 
expected to increase sharply in the forthcoming years to 2.2 billion tons per year in 2025 
[25]. Unwanted materials, by-products, and hazardous products are burnt in an open 
place, usually at low ﬂame, without any kind of management, and are considered waste 
ﬁres in waste management sites [26]. It is used to reduce the volume of waste items. In 
recent decades, many researchers and technologists have been working to develop an op-
timal waste management system to combat the issue of waste ﬁres. Battiston et al. [27] 
present an investigation of accidents related to a case study of a real ﬁre incident in a waste 
disposal using numerical simulation. This study used an actual case of a waste ﬁre inci-
dent in an industry in the northern part of Italy. The ﬁre started in a pile of unsorted mu-
nicipal trash and quickly spread to additional piles of leaves, wood, and storage spaces 
for plastic and paper products. Fire brigades were used during the experiment, which

and paper products. Fire brigades were used during the experiment, which took a few
hours to control and put out the ﬂames, which helped reduce damage. This type of study
allows for a comparison between model predictions and actual development. Savoshinsky
et al. [28] present a technique for ﬁre management during municipal waste transport using
a geographical information system (GIS). The scenario of using geoinformation systems toSustainability 2023, 15, 14241

address the issue of ﬁre safety in municipal trash transportation demonstrates the system’s
application. Zybina et al. [29] describe the safety of ﬁre incidents at the municipal landﬁll
for solid waste. The most common threat is open dumping ﬁres because the production
of biogas makes them easier to start, and thus, the resulting combustion products can be
harmful to people. The use of computer modeling allows for the evaluation of the success
of the actions carried out to overcome the problem of waste ﬁres. This paper illustrates
the construction of a ﬁre protection system for the hazardous material dumping site using
computer modeling.
Rykaa et al. [30] present the effects of a ﬁre incident in an illegal landﬁll site located
in the southern part of Poland by considering the generation of toxic chemicals and their
corresponding inﬂuence on the climate. The objective is to provide research ﬁndings on
the toxicity of garbage from a ﬁre at a Trzebinia landﬁll site in Poland. Both the waste and
soil samples are estimated in this document. Burnt garbage might contain contaminants
that are dangerous to the health and safety of land and water. As a result, it is crucial
to carry out studies and combat the harmful impacts of trash ﬁres. Aderemi et al. [31],
using a ﬁlthy dump in Lagos, Nigeria, as a case study, offer an attempt to provide some
information on landﬁll ﬁres and their possible health implications. This study indicates
that the Nigerian government must have a strict and potential law and management
policy to stop waste ﬁres at waste landﬁlls to overcome the issue of various health and
environmental consequences. Ichinose et al. [32] present a study on the relationship
between illegal dumping and waste management. This study indicates that the lack of
facilities for intermediate waste processing has signiﬁcantly increased the incidence of
illegal dumping. Øygard et al. [33] describe the impact of a mismanaged ﬁre incident and
the corresponding requirement of a ﬁreﬁght for the chemical generation of landﬁll leachate.
By digging and using water to cool, the ﬁre at the dump location was extinguished in this
research article. This paper estimates various chemical compounds generated from the
landﬁll site.
2. Some Major Impacts of Waste Fire on Environment and Human Health
A current hot topic is environmental contamination. There is pollution of air, soil,
and water. All types of open burning are harmful to the environment and the people. The
air we inhale is polluted by smoke. Our land, freshwater, reservoirs, river systems, and
streams are contaminated with ash. Anything that you burn outside can start a wildﬁre.
The probability of these negative consequences can be reduced by burning only substances
that have been allowed and by adhering to state rules and regulations. About 41% of
the garbage produced worldwide is burnt openly. However, in the developing world or
low-income countries, these data are higher. In less-rich countries, it might be challenging
to build a successful garbage collection or disposal system. At every recognized municipal
solid waste disposal site, eight pollution tracking parameters are ammonia (NH3), carbon
dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulphide (H2S), methane (CH4), nitrogen
dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and suspended particulate matter [34]. Waste open
ﬁre is popular because it is inexpensive, effective, and fast, but this process is very harmful
to the environment. The open burning of garbage might increase soil, water, and natural
toxins, as well as emit several harmful chemicals into the air. Waste ﬁres are responsible for
many environmental problems, such as air pollution, soil pollution, water pollution, GHG
emissions, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. Burning waste makes our environment
more fragile. Due to their small size and capacity to remain suspended in the air, discharged
contaminants can be deeply breathed, causing persistent bronchitis, asthma, and other
respiratory disorders. Over time, these factors increase mortality, especially in vulnerable
populations like children and the elderly. The loss of biodiversity is a quiet disaster. Every
lost species reduces ecological resilience, harming agricultural pollination and forest health.
Global ecology irreversibly alters when pollution makes areas uninhabitable, causing
species extinction in light of global climate change. Figure 3 shows the major impacts of
landﬁll ﬁre incidents on climate and human health.Sustainability 2023, 15, 14241

Figure 3. The major impacts of ﬁres from waste landﬁlls are on the environment and human
health. 
2.1. Air Pollution 
Waste ﬁres contribute to air pollution by releasing a variety of dangerous che
into the environment, including dioxins, particulate matter, toxic materials, and 
[35]. There has not been much discussion of the importance of numerous garbage
ings as a local or global cause of air pollution [36]. Due to the intense heat present 
a ﬁre, the smoke that is released is usually immediately elevated and spreads much
ground level [37]. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from waste b
cause acid rain. These emissions produce acids with water vapor in the atmospher
rain harms ecosystems, soil, and buildings [38]. This issue addresses acid rain’s en
mental eﬀects and air pollution from uncontrolled trash burning. Burning forbidde
stances, such as trash, plastic, and painted or varnished wood, damages the atmo
because these substances produce carcinogens that contaminate our air. Smoke an
can cover large areas. People may ﬁnd odors irritating. Smoke traces and smells bot
the potential to inﬁltrate homes or inﬂuence things outside of them, such as autom
or hung clothes. Signiﬁcant volumes of GHG are released into the atmosphere 
open garbage burning; these substances include methane (CH4), carbon dioxide
and diﬀerent sizes of particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and PM10, which are freq
associated with poor air quality and can cause serious cases of respiratory illness [
Some other hazardous chemicals are responsible for causing cancer, such as polyar
hydrocarbons (PAHs), including benzo(a)pyrene (BAP), released into the air as a re
uncontrolled combustion of organic materials or agricultural containers or bags co
nated with pesticides or other dangerous harmful substances, which are also releas
the air [42,43]. Furthermore, pollutants emitted by open landﬁlls can corrode meta
ing and damage the paint of the house. Figure 4 presents the list of harmful che
released after waste ﬁre incidents. 
Figure 3. The major impacts of ﬁres from waste landﬁlls are on the environment and human health.
2.1. Air Pollution
Waste ﬁres contribute to air pollution by releasing a variety of dangerous chemicals
into the environment, including dioxins, particulate matter, toxic materials, and furans [35].
There has not been much discussion of the importance of numerous garbage burnings as a
local or global cause of air pollution [36]. Due to the intense heat present during a ﬁre, the
smoke that is released is usually immediately elevated and spreads much above ground
level [37]. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from waste burning cause acid
rain. These emissions produce acids with water vapor in the atmosphere. Acid rain harms
ecosystems, soil, and buildings [38]. This issue addresses acid rain’s environmental effects
and air pollution from uncontrolled trash burning. Burning forbidden substances, such
as trash, plastic, and painted or varnished wood, damages the atmosphere because these
substances produce carcinogens that contaminate our air. Smoke and dust can cover large
areas. People may ﬁnd odors irritating. Smoke traces and smells both have the potential to
inﬁltrate homes or inﬂuence things outside of them, such as automobiles or hung clothes.
Signiﬁcant volumes of GHG are released into the atmosphere during open garbage burning;
these substances include methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and different sizes of
particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and PM10, which are frequently associated with poor air
quality and can cause serious cases of respiratory illness [39–42]. Some other hazardous
chemicals are responsible for causing cancer, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
including benzo(a)pyrene (BAP), released into the air as a result of uncontrolled combustion
of organic materials or agricultural containers or bags contaminated with pesticides or other
dangerous harmful substances, which are also released into the air [42,43]. Furthermore,
pollutants emitted by open landﬁlls can corrode metal fencing and damage the paint of the
house. Figure 4 presents the list of harmful chemicals released after waste ﬁre incidents.Sustainability 2023, 15, 14241

2.2. Soil Pollution 
The accumulation of persistent poisonous substances, chemicals, acids, toxic iso-
topes, or disease-causing factors in soils that have a negative impact on plant and animal 
health is called soil pollution. The largest portion of environmental contamination is car-
ried out by soil since it is a “universal sink” [44]. It is contaminated in many ways. To 
maintain soil fertility and increase productivity, it is vital to prevent soil contamination. 
Soil contamination is also caused or is being exacerbated by the large amounts of man-
made solid waste, sewage, waste ﬁres, landﬁlls, and other products of modern treatment 
plants for waste, even contaminated water [45,46]. The temperature and landﬁll gases pro-
duced during the decomposition of organic waste products are likely to cause uninten-
tional combustion, and sometimes, the garbage is purposely burnt. Polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAH), mainly those without alkylated hydrocarbons, are often formed 
through incomplete combustion activities, while methylated PAHs are more indicative of 
biogenic origins [47]. The creation of hazardous substances, mainly PAHs, can result from 
high-temperature combustion of organic and biomass matter. Ashes, smoke, and charcoal 
are examples of pyrogenic materials in which PAHs can be found. The presence of ash 
and charcoal can signiﬁcantly increase the toxicity of soils and water sources [48,49]. The 
primary issues with PAHs are their ability to cause human cancer, genotoxicity, persis-
tence, and biosorption. These all-hazardous chemicals generated by incomplete combus-
tion of waste are responsible for soil contamination. Furthermore, ﬁres have been ob-
served to promote the formation or remobilization of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD), 
which will be important due to their possible impacts on people and wildlife [50,51]. Both 
inorganic and organic chemicals have the ability to function as environmental pollutants 
in the soil and pose risks. Trace elements that include cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), chro-
mium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), 
manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and radionuclides are the most frequently found inorganic soil 
pollutants [52,53]. However, mercury (Hg) is sensitive to the heat emitted during a waste 
ﬁre in high amounts, in addition to environmentally damaging toxins that brutally aﬀect 
respiratory organs and the brain.

due to their possible impacts on people and wildlife [50,51]. Both inorganic and organic

Organic substances are carbon-based compounds, and many of them are anthro-
pogenic in nature and, to a lesser extent, substances originating from environmental events
such as volcanic activity or wildﬁres. Figure 5 describes the list of chemicals that can
easily contaminate soil. Synthetic organic pollutants created for certain purposes, such
as insecticides like endosulfan, hexa-chlorobenzene (HCB), dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyl-
trichloroethane (DDT), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, lindane), or as intermediate
or industrial chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organics
(VOC), can be the source of soil contamination. Pyridinium ﬂuorochromate (PFC) and poly-
brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE). (PBDE) are also responsible for soil pollution [54,55].
Therefore, as a result, any of these chemicals that have been kept and discovered during

Organic substances are carbon-based compounds, and many of them are anthrop
genic in nature and, to a lesser extent, substances originating from environmental even
such as volcanic activity or wildﬁres. Figure 5 describes the list of chemicals that can easi
contaminate soil. Synthetic organic pollutants created for certain purposes, such as inse
ticides like endosulfan, hexa-chlorobenzene (HCB), dieldrin, dichlorodiphenyltrichlor
ethane (DDT), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH, lindane), or as intermediate or indu
trial chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and volatile organics (VOC), ca
be the source of soil contamination. Pyridinium ﬂuorochromate (PFC) and polybromi
ated diphenyl ethers (PBDE). (PBDE) are also responsible for soil pollution [54,55]. Ther
fore, as a result, any of these chemicals that have been kept and discovered during th
prolonged existence of garbage at the landﬁll site have the potential to be discharged in
the soil in the event that waste ﬁre occurrences occur at the landﬁll location.

2.3. Water Pollution 
Human activities can also lead to water pollution that puts waterways at risk or r
duces their quality. For example, wildﬁres and waste ﬁres can destroy lakes and ma
them acidic. Both increased population and industrialization create risks to freshwat
resources, including lakes. Lakes and other freshwater sources provide freshwater f
houses and community groups, as well as support a variety of biomes; therefore, mai
taining these resources is crucial. Tragically, garbage is occasionally dumped near lak
without considering the eﬀects. In certain places, the disposal of industrial waste is st
not tightly regulated. Although we are aware of how essential lakes and other waterwa
are, man-made contamination sources persist [57,58]. While there are set-up rules for th
dumping of harmful industrial waste, these contaminants are thrown into ponds or w
terbodies that link lakes. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identiﬁe
two forms of water pollution: point-source and nonpoint-source. The EPA deﬁnes poin
source pollution as pollution from a single source, such as smokestacks, drainage tube
industrial waste, wastewater treatment plants, factories, and power plants. Nonpoi

2.3. Water Pollution
Human activities can also lead to water pollution that puts waterways at risk or re-
duces their quality. For example, wildﬁres and waste ﬁres can destroy lakes and make them
acidic. Both increased population and industrialization create risks to freshwater resources,
including lakes. Lakes and other freshwater sources provide freshwater for houses and
community groups, as well as support a variety of biomes; therefore, maintaining these
resources is crucial. Tragically, garbage is occasionally dumped near lakes without con-
sidering the effects. In certain places, the disposal of industrial waste is still not tightly
regulated. Although we are aware of how essential lakes and other waterways are, man-
made contamination sources persist [57,58]. While there are set-up rules for the dumping
of harmful industrial waste, these contaminants are thrown into ponds or waterbodies that
link lakes. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identiﬁed two forms of
water pollution: point-source and nonpoint-source. The EPA deﬁnes point-source pollution
as pollution from a single source, such as smokestacks, drainage tubes, industrial waste,
wastewater treatment plants, factories, and power plants. Nonpoint source pollution is a
mixture of pollutants discharged from a vast area. Pollution occurs from multiple sources,
making it harder to identify and handle (e.g., thunderstorms, runoff, oils, grease, animalSustainability 2023, 15, 14241

waste, pesticides, and fertilizer) [59]. Together with industrial pollution, some people also
contaminate lakes by dropping trash or waste in them [60].
Agriculturally based pollutants that impact groundwater include pathogens, nutrients,
metals, pesticides, and salts. Furthermore, dangerous compounds released into river water
by urban operations are present in partially treated and untreated sewage, solid/liquid
waste, and construction waste components, which are also the main source of water
contamination [61]. Acid rain is the result of the emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2)
and nitrogen oxide (NO2) from chimneys and exhaust pipes, which are produced by
manufacturing companies and can have a negative inﬂuence on the environment and
human health [62]. A solid landﬁll liner is not always required, although landﬁll drainage
from garbage disposal is a known reservoir for groundwater contaminants. Therefore,
waste disposal and waste ﬁres have a wide impact on the quality of water in several ways.
2.4. Impacts on Human Health
The burning residue can contaminate land and groundwater and infect vegetables
and cattle, which can then inﬁltrate the human food supply. Furthermore, some speciﬁc
chemicals released during waste ﬁres might accumulate in animal fats and later in people
because we consume dairy products, meat, and ﬁsh. Those who live close to a landﬁll ﬁre
have adverse health effects from toxins released during the burn. The width between com-
munities and the location of the waste ﬁre is one of the most crucial variables in determining
the inﬂuence on health. In general, the presence of PM10 in the air due to ﬁres at landﬁll
sites greatly affects the health of humans [63]. There is a speciﬁc relationship between PM10
concentration in the air and the relative increase in the death risk. The particles of waste
combustion also contain varying amounts of sulphur, and the acidic nature of sulphur
compounds (e.g., ammonium sulphate, ammonium bisulphate, or sulfuric acid) makes the
transition metals in particles more bioavailable, greatly increasing the potential of waste
combustion PM2.5 to cause oxidative stress and systemic health effects [43,64,65]. People
who are exposed to these pollutants in the air usually experience headaches, coughing,
eye and nose irritation, and breathing problems. Individuals who suffer from respiratory
diseases, including emphysema, asthma, and heart disease, are particularly vulnerable
to environmental pollution. Environmental pollution can also exacerbate allergies, lung
infections, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia [66,67]. Chronic diseases of the respiratory and
cardiovascular systems, kidney problems, cancers, tumors or malignancies, and diseases of
the lymphatic and hematological systems are only a few of the long-term impacts of trash
burning. According to certain research, landﬁll ﬁres can affect the reproductive system,
fetuses, newborns and the onset of congenital abnormalities [68–70]. Figure 6 shows some
of the major health problems associated with waste ﬁres and landﬁlls.

source pollution is a mixture of pollutants discharged from a vast area. Pollution occurs 
from multiple sources, making it harder to identify and handle (e.g., thunderstorms, run-
oﬀ, oils, grease, animal waste, pesticides, and fertilizer) [59]. Together with industrial pol-
lution, some people also contaminate lakes by dropping trash or waste in them [60]. 
Agriculturally based pollutants that impact groundwater include pathogens, nutri-

quantities, and how they enter a person’s body might cause their persistent buildup in the
liver and kidneys, which may disrupt a number of metabolic processes, which aggravateSustainability 2023, 15, 14241

conditions and illnesses of the neurological, skeletal, kidney, and cardiovascular systems.
Exposure to heavy metals has been shown to have harmful effects on health: respiratory
tract, nose, sinuses, and lungs; while drinking contaminated water may increase your risk
of colorectal, stomach, and oral cancer; hearing loss; kidney and liver dysfunction; problems
in the central nervous; neurological conditions that include excretion and hypersensitivity
diseases as well as numbness or tingling, postural hypotension, and neurodegenerative
disorders [71,72].
2.5. Impacts on Social Economy
Waste ﬁres pose a multidimensional threat to the social economy. Uncontrolled
garbage combustion releases several dangerous compounds and contaminants into the
environment. Air pollution can cause several health problems in local communities [73,74].
This increases healthcare costs and reduces productivity due to lost labor hours. In addition,
such ﬁres destroy recyclable materials. It eliminates recycling revenue and increases
waste, which harms the environment. Waste ﬁres can damage infrastructure such as
recycling plants and landﬁlls, requiring costly repairs or replacement. Fires cause more
than just immediate costs. Given the health risks and stigma of these incidents, the prices
in adjacent neighborhoods drop. This can also affect tourism, as environmental views
can strongly inﬂuence trafﬁc. Waste-ﬁre-ravaged regions may lose tourism, hurting their
economies. Another ﬁnancial burden is ﬁre cleanup, which typically requires specialized
processes to mitigate environmental damage. Recurrent ﬁres in waste management facilities
can cause temporary or permanent shutdowns, causing job losses. Waste management
companies may face rising insurance prices if they are considered high-risk due to frequent
occurrences [75,76].
3. Safety Measures to Mitigate Waste Fires
Most waste ﬁres occur in waste landﬁlls that have been continuously ﬁlled even
though the landﬁll site is beyond its optimal capacity. Waste ﬁres that occur in landﬁlls are
either started as a result of chemical reactions and increased temperature or intentionally
to reduce the volume of waste. A substantial amount of dangerous toxic chemicals is
produced in high concentrations by landﬁll ﬁres, and these pollutants can spread over great
areas by dense clouds of toxic smoke [77]. Fires in the garbage can have signiﬁcant negative
impacts on the environment or seriously harm human health. There are several methods to
limit or avoid these impacts, such as blocking waste ﬁres, limiting the extent and expansion
of ﬁre, and reducing the consequences of waste ﬁre consequences. However, all of these
measures need proper planning and organization. While the mitigation of waste ﬁres can
be done in various ways, one of the best approaches based on our studies is to focus on the
following strategies.
•
Design and layout of the waste management facility
•
Appropriate organization and planning
•
Reception of garbage products
•
Storage and handling of waste products
•
Proper action during ﬁre incidents
•
Adequate action plan after a ﬁre outbreak
These particular courses of action are suggested to reduce the risk of waste ﬁre in
several facilities depending on the process of handling waste and the strategies determined
for a possible future ﬁre outbreak. In other words, the storage strategy affects the emer-
gency action plan, and the estimation of the input for the extinguished water depends
on the strategies speciﬁed in the action plan and the order considered with respect to the
extinguished media utilized. Thus, entire plans must be admitted, developed, conveyed,
and trained before the occurrence of waste ﬁre. Table 2 shows the recommended course of
action to mitigate waste ﬁres.Sustainability 2023, 15, 14241

It is crucial to realize that even if several actions are suggested, this does not imply that
these policies must be implemented uniformly throughout all facilities. What measures
are adopted depends on the activities taking place in the facility, the item that is being
held, as well as local laws and other circumstances. There are several regulations that
deﬁne maximum altitudes and transitions between trash piles. They may be helpful in
certain circumstances, but it is important to understand that risks vary based on the sorts
of fractions and combinations [82]. To effectively handle garbage, the essential heights and
space between stacks could change. Moreover, crucial stack sizes and separations depend
not only on the threat of ﬁre expansion but also on the likelihood of effective and safe
ﬁreﬁghting operations by the rescue and ﬁre departments. This must be considered when
stacking the debris in long rows or blocks. It is important to consider how different forms
of barriers are used [83].
In recent decades, several models have been invented for the simulation of waste ﬁre
mitigation. For the modeling of material dispersion throughout the atmosphere, a variety
of models are known regarding the space and time data collected by using meteorological
conditions, such as AERMOD presented by the US EPA (United States Environmental
Protection Agency) and generally considered for short-range impact up to 50 km, the
California Puff (CALPUFF) created by the US EPA and considered for the long range of
more than 50 km, the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CAMQ) system for modeling
was developed by the US EPA in 2019 which is responsible for the evaluation of chemicalSustainability 2023, 15, 14241
12 of 16
reactions in the environment, and many more [84,85]. These models are developed and
used to address the issue of waste ﬁres and their relative impacts on the environment.
The importance of policies and regulations in prevention and control cannot be under-
stated, as effective risk assessment and zoning can ensure waste management facilities are
located away from vulnerable areas while stringent waste storage and disposal regulations
mitigate the chances of accidental ﬁres. Modernizing waste management infrastructure,
supported by government policies, can incorporate advanced ﬁre prevention systems.
Equally vital is regular training of personnel in these facilities and instigating public aware-
ness campaigns about the dangers and preventatives of waste ﬁres. Regular inspections
by authorities will ensure compliance with safety standards, and penalties for violations
can act as effective deterrents. Collaborative research and stakeholder engagement, un-
derpinned by a dedicated regulatory body and incentives for green technologies, can
further strengthen the overall framework. A combination of preventive strategies and
responsive measures, driven by well-designed policies, is pivotal in mitigating the risks
and repercussions of waste ﬁres [86,87].
In general, several studies have been created for the evaluation of durability, break-
down, or vulnerability in landﬁlls, including slope instability and problems of speciﬁc
design elements such as failure of the gas/leachate collection system, for example, or of the
lining. The Delphi method and conventional hydrological risk assessments can be used to
analyze the failure of the landﬁll liner [88]. Remote sensing can be used to monitor risk
factors and areas of ﬁre occurrence at the landﬁll site for waste management. After the
integration of artiﬁcial techniques into remote sensing technology, remote sensing might
be useful to mitigate various environmental issues created by open ﬁres [89,90]. Artiﬁcial
intelligence can play a vital role in protecting the environment. The Monte Carlo simulation
technique and the ﬁrst-order reliability technique with an artiﬁcial neural network are used
to examine the stability of the reliability of the landﬁll on the gradient in several parameters
of rainfall [91] by developing a unique probabilistic risk assessment approach that uses
Taylor series and Monte Carlo techniques to analyze the risk of slope failure in landﬁlls
from both the vulnerability and the hazardous perspectives [92]. These initiatives have
gone far in taking safety measures into account to control the incidence of failure in various
engineering elements of landﬁll engineering during the design and operating stages.
4. Conclusions
Solid waste from municipal landﬁlls could be dangerous to the environment and
people’s health because of poor management, as well as a lack of adequate prevention
schemes. This research attempted to assess the health risks and environmental damage
related to waste combustion and landﬁlling. The information was acquired using a desk
evaluation design and from publicly existing sources. The three main topics of the reviewed
literature were waste disposal sites, environmental contamination due to waste burning,
human health problems due to waste ﬁres, and appropriate measures to overcome this
problem. Many dangerous gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulphide (H2S),
methane (CH4), and many more can be released from landﬁlls and waste ﬁres. This
research paper also provides some details on model simulation to combat waste ﬁres and
their corresponding impacts on the environment and human health. These toxins have
been associated with problems with the lungs and some cancers, such as lung cancer.
Soil pollution and water pollution from open ﬁres and waste ﬁres have been discussed in
detail. In addition, this article provides an extensive study of waste ﬁres and landﬁlls on
the environment and human health, as well as possible techniques for the elimination of
this problem.
We provide a comprehensive background on how we can overcome this problem, as
waste combustion and landﬁlling represent serious threats to human and environmental
health and must be addressed comprehensively. Enhanced waste management strategies
should be prioritized ﬁrst. Recycling, composting, and garbage minimization should be
prioritized to reduce the load on landﬁlls. Furthermore, improvements in landﬁll layout andSustainability 2023, 15, 14241
13 of 16
consistent maintenance are crucial. The negative effects on the surrounding environment
can be mitigated by the installation of cutting-edge gas collection systems and efﬁcient
leachate treatment facilities. Public education initiatives also play a crucial role. Waste ﬁres
can be greatly mitigated if the public is made aware of the many ways in which they can
cause harm to the environment and people’s health. These steps, taken together, provide
a detailed plan for improving the sustainability and safety of waste management. The
ﬁndings of this study indicate that the lack of facilities for intermediate waste processing
has signiﬁcantly increased the incidence of illegal dumping and will contribute to the
research community, where early-stage researchers can obtain the state of the background
of waste ﬁres. The ﬁndings of this study indicate that the lack of facilities for intermediate
waste processing has signiﬁcantly increased the incidence of illegal disposal.

Global association of air pollution and heart failure: 
a systematic review and meta-analysis
Anoop S V Shah, Jeremy P Langrish, Harish Nair, David A McAllister, Amanda L Hunter, Ken Donaldson, David E Newby, Nicholas L Mills
Summary
Background Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to myocardial infarction, but its eﬀ ect on heart failure is 
uncertain. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between air pollution and acute 
decompensated heart failure including hospitalisation and heart failure mortality.
Methods Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in gaseous 
(carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate (diameter <2·5 μm [PM₂.₅] or 
<10 μm [PM₁₀]) air pollutants, and heart failure hospitalisations or heart failure mortality. We used a random-eﬀ ects 
model to derive overall risk estimates per pollutant.
Findings Of 1146 identiﬁ ed articles, 195 were reviewed in-depth with 35 satisfying inclusion criteria. Heart failure 
hospitalisation or death was associated with increases in carbon monoxide (3·52% per 1 part per million; 95% CI 
2·52–4·54), sulphur dioxide (2·36% per 10 parts per billion; 1·35–3·38), and nitrogen dioxide (1·70% per 10 parts per 
billion; 1·25–2·16), but not ozone (0·46% per 10 parts per billion; −0·10 to 1·02) concentrations. Increases in 
particulate matter con centration were associated with heart failure hospitalisation or death (PM2·5 2·12% per 10 μg/m³, 
95% CI 1·42–2·82; PM10 1·63% per 10 μg/m³, 95% CI 1·20–2·07). Strongest associations were seen on the day of 
exposure, with more persistent eﬀ ects for PM2·5. In the USA, we estimate that a mean reduction in PM2·5 of 3·9 μg/m³ 
would prevent 7978 heart failure hospitalisations and save a third of a billion US dollars a year.
Interpretation Air pollution has a close temporal association with heart failure hospitalisation and heart failure mortality. 
Although more studies from developing nations are required, air pollution is a pervasive public health issue with major 
cardiovascular and health economic consequences, and it should remain a key target for global health policy.
Funding British Heart Foundation.
Introduction
The adverse eﬀ ects of air pollution on cardiovascular 
health have been established in a series of major 
epidemiological and observational studies.1–4 WHO 
estimates that air pollution is responsible for over a 
million premature deaths worldwide every year.5 
Even brief exposures to air pollution have been associated 
with increases in cardiovascular mortality,6,7 particularly 
in susceptible populations.
Heart failure is an escalating public health issue that 
aﬀ ects more than 23 million people worldwide,8 with 
an increasing prevalence in elderly people.9,10 It has 
an annual hospitalisation rate of 2% with subsequent 
1-year mortality of 30%.11 Heart failure ranks as the 
most 
frequent 
reason 
for 
hospitalisation 
and 
rehospitalisation in older people,12,13 accounting for 
5% of all hospital discharge diagnoses. The triggers 
of 
acute 
cardiac 
decompensation 
especially 
in 
susceptible individuals are therefore a major public 
health concern.
Population and individual level exposures to air 
pollution are associated with acute cardiovascular 
events such as myocardial infarction.14,15 However, the 
eﬀ ect of air pollution on other cardiovascular con-
ditions, such as acute decompensated heart failure, has 
been less well described.16 This issue is important 
because there are major diﬀ erences in the mechanisms 
that trigger myocardial infarction compared with acute 
decompensated heart failure.17–19
Several studies of short-term exposure to air pollution 
have included heart failure hospitalisation and mortality, 
although these endpoints have not been the primary 
focus in most analyses. We therefore systematically 
reviewed the evidence examining the association 
between air pollution and acute decompensated heart 
failure, including hospitalisation and heart failure 
mortality.
Methods
Databases
We searched Ovid Medline, Embase, Global Health, 
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science using the 
following keywords: “heart failure”, “congestive cardiac 
failure”, “air pollution”, “particulate matter”, “ozone”, 
“carbon monoxide”, “sulphur dioxide”, and “nitrogen 
dioxide”. The full search criteria are available in the 
appendix. Bibliographic reference lists of studies 
selected for inclusion in our meta-analysis and relevant 
review articles were manually searched (appendix). We 
limited our search to studies published between 1948 
and July 15, 2012.

Selection of articles and extraction of data
Studies were included if they presented original data for 
gaseous (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen 
dioxide, ozone) or particulate (PM2·5 or PM10) air pollu-
tants and reported heart failure hospitalisation or heart 
failure mortality. We included all studies that reported 
associations between exposure and outcome up to and 
including lag (day) 7. There were no language restrictions 
and we included only peer-reviewed original articles.
Data were extracted independently by two investigators 
(ASVS and JPL) and conﬂ icts were adjudicated by a third 
investigator (ALH). We contacted authors for additional 
data or clariﬁ cation where needed.
Both case-crossover and time-series studies were 
included. The case-crossover design compares exposure in 
a case period when the event occurred with exposure 
in speciﬁ ed control periods.20 This design can control 
for individual characteristics such as age, sex, and comor-
bidity, as well as secular trends and seasonal patterns using 
a time-stratiﬁ ed approach, but assumes time-varying risk 
factors are constant within reference periods.21 Time-series 
studies were used to assess the relation between exposure 
and outcome using regression analysis account ing for 
confounding factors, such as meteorological param eters, 
but are less eﬀ ective at controlling for secular trends such 
as seasonality.22 The study design, study popu lation, and 
adjustment undertaken for potential confound ers have 
been summarised for each study in the appendix.
Data synthesis
Relative risks (RR) were pooled for a standardised 
increment in pollutant concentration as follows: 10 μg/m³ 
for PM2·5 and PM10, 10 parts per billion for nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3), and 
1 part per million for carbon monoxide (CO). Many 
studies used generalised linear models and therefore we 
assumed a linear relation between exposure and outcome. 
Standardised risk estimates were calculated for each 
study using the following formula:
Four studies reported stratiﬁ ed risk estimates by age,23 
location,24 and temperature25,26 rather than overall risk 
estimates, and the stratiﬁ ed estimates were included in 
our meta-analysis. Two studies reported results from the 
same population using both case-crossover and time-
series analysis27,28 and estimates from the time-series 
analyses were included. Three studies29–31 subsequently 
revised their time series analyses and the revised 
estimates were included.32,33 Time-series analyses were 
mainly based on routine administrative datasets and did 
not adjust for individual characteristics such as age, sex, 
or socioeconomic status. For all studies, we pooled 
adjusted risk estimates controlling for meteorological, 
temporal, and seasonal parameters (appendix).
Many studies provided multiple estimates for single lags 
(for example lag 0 or lag 1) and were pooled separately. We 
only pooled estimates for single lags where more than 
three estimates were available. The shortest lag was used 
to assess overall risk estimates. A few studies only 
provided cumulative lags (for example lag 0–1 or 0–2), and 
were not suitable for pooling in the single lag analysis, but 
were used to determine overall risk estimates.
Additional analyses
We did additional analyses stratifying studies by study 
design (time-series vs case-crossover), geographical 
location (USA vs non-USA), age (all ages vs ≥65 years of 
age), and outcome (heart failure hospitalisation vs heart 
failure mortality). We assumed that the prevalence of air 
pollution exposure was 100% and therefore calculated 
population-attributable risks per pollutant using our 
overall risk estimates and the formula:
Funnel plots were constructed for assessment of 
publication bias (data not shown) and assessed for 
asymmetry using Egger’s regression test.34 Asymmetry 
was then corrected using the trim and ﬁ ll method, with 
adjusted relative risks and number of studies adjusted 
presented per pollutant.35
We used PM2·5 to illustrate the potential eﬀ ect of reduc-
ing air pollution concentration on heart failure hospital-
isations in the USA. For each state we obtained the number 
of heart failure hospitalisations and average cost per 
hospitalisation (amount charged for the hospital stay 
excluding professional fees) from the US Healthcare Cost 
and Utilization Project State Inpatient Database13 and the 
Chronic Condition and Data Warehouse (appendix). The 
median daily PM2·5 concentration was calculated for each 
state from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 
Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research 
(WONDER) database. In each state, we estimated the 
population-attributable risks and annual reduction in heart 
failure hospitalisations per 100 000 people for a reduction 
in PM2·5 concentration to 5·8 μg/m³. This concentration 
represents a target threshold below which the adverse 
health eﬀ ects of PM2·5 are uncertain.36,37
Statistical analysis
We anticipated heterogeneity between studies due to 
diﬀ erent study designs, methods of analysis, diﬀ erent lag 
exposures, and geographical and population diﬀ erences. 
We used a random-eﬀ ects model to account for both 
within and between study heterogeneity. Heterogeneity 
was examined using the standard I² test. As this test has 
limited power when applied to a small number of studies, 
we considered the presence of heterogeneity at 10% level 
of signiﬁ cance and I² exceeding 30%. The analysis was

stated in the paper, were estimated from mean daily values and the study period. †Colais et al initially published results in 2009 looking at NO₂, SO₂, and PM₁₀ in Italian. These data were later published in 
2012 in English but only reporting estimates for PM₁₀. We have therefore used the PM10 estimates from 2012 and NO₂ and SO₂ estimates from 2009. ‡Peel et al and Metzger et al reported results from the 
same study cohort but using case-crossover and time-series study designs, respectively. §Lippmann et al, Goldberg et al, and Hoek et al presented revised estimates of time-series analyses. ¶Stieb et al (2000) 
did not report numerical risk estimates and increment value for pollutants measured. This study was therefore excluded from the meta-analysis. ||Morris et al and Schwartz et al both reported data from 
Detroit across the same study period albeit with diﬀ erent lag structures. Morris et al measured associations across shorter lag structures and these estimates were chosen for the meta-analysis of gaseous 
pollutants. Schwartz et al additionally reported data for PM₁₀ whereas Morris et al did not and the study was included in the PM₁₀ meta-analysis.

design,26,28,38–46 24 used a times-series design,24,27,29,30,47–66 and 
one used both study designs67 incorporating four million 
events across the world (table 1).
There was a positive association between heart failure 
hospitalisation or heart failure mortality, and all gaseous 
and particulate air pollutants except ozone (ﬁ gure 1). The 
strongest associations were seen at lag 0, with this eﬀ ect 
diminishing at longer lag times. Carbon monoxide was 
the most frequently studied gaseous pollutant, and 
showed a 3·52% (95% CI 2·52–4·54%) increase in heart 
failure hospitalisations or mortality per 1 part per million 
increment across nearly two million events. Both 
PM2·5 (2·12%, 95% CI 1·42–2·82) and PM10 (1·63%, 
1·20–2·07) were positively associated with heart failure 
hospitalisation or mortality with a marked temporal 
relation and the strongest associations present at lag 0.
We did additional analyses by outcome, study design, 
age, and geographical location (ﬁ gure 2). There was no 
change in eﬀ ect direction across all pollutants in these 
analyses. Publication bias (Egger’s test for asymmetry, 
p<0·05) was noted for all pollutants except ozone 
(table 2). Adjusting for asymmetry using the trim and ﬁ ll 
method did not alter the eﬀ ect direction but, as expected, 
did attenuate the eﬀ ect size. We observed heterogeneity

across all pollutants, which was most evident for nitrogen 
dioxide and carbon monoxide (I² of 91%) and least 
evident for PM2·5 (I² of 53%).
Median daily PM2·5 concentrations varied across states, 
with the highest population-attributable risks seen in 
Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee and the lowest in 
Utah, Wyoming, and North Dakota (appendix). Reducing 
PM2·5 concentrations to 5·8 μg/m³ in each state would 
require a mean reduction in PM2·5 of 3·9 μg/m³ across 
the USA. The greatest eﬀ ect on heart failure hospital-
isations would be in those states with the highest median 
daily PM2·5 concentrations (ﬁ gure 3). We estimate that 
this reduction would prevent 7978 heart failure hospital-
isations and would be associated with savings of around 
US$307 million per year (appendix).
Discussion
There were robust and clear temporal associations between 
exposure to air pollutants and heart failure hospitalisations 
and mortality. The magnitude and direction of our overall 
estimates persisted despite conservative modelling. All 
studies except one were done in developed countries where 
even modest improvements in air quality standards are 
projected to have major population health beneﬁ ts and 
substantial health-care cost savings.
The eﬀ ect of air pollution on heart failure hospitalisation 
and mortality might be underestimated. First, our 
estimates are based on acute events associated with 
short-term exposures and do not take into account the 
adverse eﬀ ects of chronic exposure to air pollution.3 We

have not considered long-term studies of air pollution in 
the current meta-analysis and therefore are unable to 
quantify any additive temporal eﬀ ects of air pollution. 
Second, although our meta-analysis estimates the eﬀ ect 
of short-term increases in air pollution on the population, 
this eﬀ ect is likely to be greater in patients with 
pre-existing heart failure. Unfortunately, we were unable 
to stratify our analysis on the presence, severity, or 
phenotype of pre-existing heart failure, since these data 
were not available. Third, regional monitoring sites are 
likely to underestimate personal exposure in individuals 
living near major roadways. This may be an important 
consideration in estimating individual risk given that 
traﬃ  c-related air pollutants are thought to be the primary 
mediators of the cardiovascular eﬀ ects of air pollution.19
A recent assessment of the global burden of disease 
ranked PM2·5 air pollution as one of the leading causes of 
death and disability worldwide.37 The American Thoracic 
Society recently advocated stricter standards for PM₂.₅ 
recommending a 10 μg/m³ reduction in daily maximum 
concentrations to 25 μg/m³.68 Recent studies indicate the 
persistence of adverse health eﬀ ects at concentrations 
below those recommended by WHO.69 In our impact 
analysis, we estimate that reducing median daily PM₂.₅ 
concentrations by a mean of 3·9 μg/m³ would prevent 
roughly 8000 heart failure hospitalisations in the USA, 
with an associated saving of nearly a third of a billion 
dollars per annum. Smaller reductions in PM2·5 would 
prevent fewer hospitalisations, but could still confer 
signiﬁ cant public health beneﬁ ts.
Urban cities in developing countries are likely to have 
PM2·5 concentrations up to 10-fold higher than the US 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards.70,71 So-called 
megacities, with populations well above 10 million people 
such as New Delhi in India and Beijing in China, have 
daily PM2·5 concentrations of 100–300 μg/m³ compared 
with a median PM2·5 concentration of 15 μg/m³ in the 
cities included in our meta-analysis.70,72 However, 
assessment of the eﬀ ect of air pollution in developing 
countries is diﬃ  cult because of a lack of cohesive air 
quality policies in combination with poor environmental 
monitoring and a paucity of disease surveillance data.73
The lack of data from developing countries is con cerning 
because these regions are likely to be aﬀ ected most and 
have the greatest potential to improve health. The problem 
is highlighted in our meta-analysis where only one of the 
35 studies was done in a developing country.53 In areas 
with high levels of air pollution there are likely to be more 
frequent and more marked changes in air pollution 
exposure on a daily basis.72 Whether actual or relative 
increases in exposure would determine outcomes in these 
regions is uncertain.
In our additional analysis stratifying studies by 
location, we found risk estimates were almost twice as 
high in countries outside the USA where ambient 
concentrations are generally higher. As such, caution is 
necessary when extrapolating overall risk estimates 
from our meta-analysis to regions with higher air 
pollution concentrations.
Most hospitalisations in patients with heart failure are 
due to acute decompensated heart failure and dys-
rhythmias,74 with fewer patients hospitalised because of 
coexisting coronary heart disease and pulmonary 
disease.16 The biological mechanisms precipitating acute 
decompensation in patients with heart failure are likely to 
diﬀ er substantially from those involved in triggering 
acute myocardial infarction.19 Acute decompensated heart 
failure can be caused by increasing demand on the heart, 
such as increased heart rate, blood pressure, and ﬁ lling 
pressures, or further impairment of cardiac performance, 
such as reduced contractility and increased myocardial 
injury. Exposure to particulate matter air pollution has 
been associated with increased systemic blood pressure 
and vasoconstriction.75–77 Both pulmonary and right 
ventricular diastolic ﬁ lling pressures are increased by 
exposure to ambient particulate matter, suggesting 
a pulmonary vasoconstrictor eﬀ ect of air pollution.78 
Together with arrhythmias,79 these eﬀ ects of air pollution 
will markedly increase the demands on the failing heart 
and thereby potentially precipitate acute decompensation. 
In addition to loss of contractile capacity through 
myocardial infarction,80 inhalation of particulate matter is 
associated with adverse ventricular remodelling and 
a worsening of myocardial ﬁ brosis.81 These factors could 
have synergistic detrimental eﬀ ects on cardiac function.
Although particulate matter is considered to be 
responsible for most adverse cardiovascular outcomes,82 
we cannot exclude an eﬀ ect of non-particulate air 
pollutants either in isolation or combination. We noted 
an adverse relation between exposure to all gaseous 
pollutants except for ozone and heart failure outcomes. 
The acute eﬀ ects of carbon monoxide exposure on cardiac 
function are well known,83 but most of these studies have 
assessed the eﬀ ects of exposure to more than 1000 parts 
per million of carbon monoxide as a model of cigarette 
smoking.84,85 Ambient carbon monoxide or nitrogen 
dioxide con centrations might simply reﬂ ect exposure to 
road traﬃ  c or combustion derived particles. Chamber 
studies also show that exposure to gaseous pollutants 
alone at high ambient concentrations does not cause 
acute cardiovascular dysfunction.86,87
Several limitations of our study should be considered. 
First, we found signiﬁ cant heterogeneity across all 
pollutants, which could indicate diﬀ erences in population 
demographics, sample size, patient characteristics, and 
exposure misclassiﬁ cation due to variation in the accuracy 
of regional air pollution monitoring. However, pooled 
risk estimates showed consistency across all pollutants 
and the eﬀ ect direction was not changed in our additional 
analyses. Second, we report estimates for single pollu-
tants, which do not take into consideration potential 
additive eﬀ ects of multiple pollutants or adjustments for 
collinearity.88 Third, meta-analysis of observational studies 
has limitations with inherent biases. We noticedArticles

signiﬁ cant publication bias across all pollutants, except 
ozone. However, after adjustment for asymmetry, the 
overall eﬀ ect direction remained unchanged. Fourth, 
most studies pooled in our meta-analysis used data 
from routine administrative sources. There was limited 
validation of outcomes, with coding error and misclassiﬁ -
cation potentially giving rise to non-diﬀ erential bias. 
However, nine of the 35 studies in our meta-analysis, 
encompassing almost 2 million events, used Medicare’s 
hospital claims database. Coding for heart failure has 
been validated by case note review and found to have 84% 
agreement with the principal diagnosis.89 Finally, we did 
not have access to primary data and were unable to 
establish whether multiple hospitalisations might have 
occurred in the same patient. This point is important, 
since patients with recurrent hospitalisations could be 
more susceptible to the eﬀ ects of air pollution.
Acute decompensated heart failure is a common, 
costly, and often fatal condition. Change in gaseous and 
particulate air pollutant concentrations have a marked 
and close temporal association with adverse outcomes in 
heart failure. More high-quality studies are urgently 
needed to establish the eﬀ ect of air pollution on heart 
failure outcomes in middle-income and low-income 
countries. Although the causality and biological mechan-
isms need further exploration, air pollution is a pervasive 
public health issue with major cardiovascular and health-
care economic consequences presenting a key target for 
national and international intervention.

Summary
Background Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths attributable to either heat or cold in 
selected countries, none has so far oﬀ ered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations 
exposed to diﬀ erent climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient 
temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures.
Methods We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, 
Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We ﬁ tted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling 
for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature–mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear 
model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators 
and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, deﬁ ned as temperatures 
above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate 
and extreme temperatures, deﬁ ned using cutoﬀ s at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles.
Findings We analysed 74 225 200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7·71% (95% empirical CI 
7·43–7·91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study 
period, with substantial diﬀ erences between countries, ranging from 3·37% (3·06 to 3·63) in Thailand to 11·00% 
(9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile 
in tropical areas to about the 80–90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were 
caused by cold (7·29%, 7·02–7·49) than by heat (0·42%, 0·39–0·44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were 
responsible for 0·86% (0·84–0·87) of total mortality.
Interpretation Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The 
eﬀ ect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. 
This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health 
consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future eﬀ ect in climate-change scenarios.

Introduction
Many epidemiological studies have provided evidence for 
the association between ambient temperature and 
mortality or morbidity outcomes.1,2 Interest in this topic 
has increased after episodes of extreme weather and in 
response to reports about climate change.3–5
Although consensus exists among researchers that 
both extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures 
aﬀ ect health, their relative importance is a matter of 
current debate and other details of the association remain 
unexplored. For example, little is known about the 
optimum temperatures that correspond to minimum 
eﬀ ects for various health outcomes. Furthermore, most 
research has focused on extreme events and no 
studies have comparatively assessed the contribution of 
moderately high and low temperatures. The underlying 
physiopathological mechanisms that link exposure to 
non-optimum temperature and mortality risk have not 
been completely elucidated. Heat stroke on hot days and 
hypothermia on cold days only account for small 
proportions of excess deaths. High and low temperatures 
have been associated with increased risk for a wide 
range of cardiovascular, respiratory, and other causes, 
suggesting the existence of multiple biological pathways.6–9 
Ambient temperature represents an impor tant risk 
factor and further investigation is needed to strengthen 
understanding of the associated health eﬀ ects. This infor-
mation is essential for planning of suitable public health 
interventions and for provision of reliable predictions for 
the eﬀ ects of climate change.
Epidemiological studies of the topic face important 
challenges in modelling of temperature–health depen-
dencies. First, the dose-response association, which is 
inherently non-linear, is also characterised by diﬀ erent 
lag periods for heat and cold—ie, excess risk caused by 
heat is typically immediate and occurs within a few days,

while the eﬀ ects of cold have been reported to last up to 
3 or 4 weeks.6,7 Second, the association is heterogeneous 
between populations because of acclimatisation, diﬀ erent 
adaptation responses, and variability in susceptibility 
factors.10–12 Modelling of such complex patterns needs a 
sophisticated statistical approach. Although studies have 
quantiﬁ ed the association in terms of relative risk (RR), 
few have given estimates of the attributable burden, 
either as absolute excess (numbers) or relative excess 
(fractions) of deaths.13–19 The evidence for the attributable 
risk of temperature is very often restricted to extreme 
events, especially heatwaves,17,18 although few investi-
gations have reported values from dose-response 
associations estimated in models with temperature as a 
continuous variable.13,14
We aimed to quantify total mortality burden attributable 
to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative 
contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and 
extreme temperatures. We based our analysis on recent 
advances in statistical modelling to account for the 
complex and heterogeneous temperature–mortality 
dependency.
Methods
Study design and data
We collected time-series daily data, including mortality, 
weather variables, and air pollution measures, from 
384 locations in 13 countries: Australia (three cities, 
1988–2009), Brazil (18 cities, 1997–2011), Canada (21 cities, 
1986–2009), China (15 cities, 1996–2008), Italy (11 cities, 
1987–2010), Japan (47 prefectures, 1985–2012), South 
Korea (seven cities, 1992–2010), Spain (51 cities, 
1990–2010), Sweden (one county, 1990–2002), Taiwan 
(three cities, 1994–2007), Thailand (62 provinces, 
1999–2008), UK (ten regions, 1993–2006), and USA 
(135 cities, 1985–2009). Mortality was represented by daily 
counts of deaths for either all causes or, where not available, 
non-external causes only (International Classiﬁ cation of 
Diseases [ICD]-9 0-799, ICD-10 A00-R99). We chose mean 
daily temperature as the exposure index, calculated from 
central monitor stations, either as the average between 
maximum and minimum values or the 24 h average. We 
did a sensitivity analysis by modifying the modelling 
choices, replacing all-cause with non-external mortality, 
and controlling for air pollution and humidity in the 
subset of countries that provided such information. The 
appendix contains details of the exact study periods, 
further information on data collection, additional results, 
and results from the sensitivity analysis. 
Statistical analysis
We did all analysis with R software (version 3.0.3) using 
the packages dlnm and mvmeta. The code is available on 
request, and a reproducible example is included at the 
personal website of the ﬁ rst author. We ﬁ rst applied a 
standard time-series quasi-Poisson regression separately 
in each location to derive estimates of location-speciﬁ c 
temperature–mortality associations, reported as RR. 
Speciﬁ c tutorials explain the technical details and 
terminology.20 Brieﬂ y, this ﬁ rst-stage regression included a 
natural cubic B-spline of time with 8 degrees of freedom 
per year to control for seasonal and long-term trends, and 
an indicator of day of the week. We modelled the 
association with temperature using a distributed lag 
non-linear model.21 This class of models can describe 
complex non-linear and lagged dependencies through the 
combination of two functions that deﬁ ne the conventional 
exposure-response association and the additional lag-
response association, respectively. The lag-response 
association represents the temporal change in risk after a 
speciﬁ c exposure, and it estimates the distribution of 
immediate and delayed eﬀ ects that cumulate across the lag 
period. Speciﬁ cally, we modelled the exposure-response 
curve with a quadratic B-spline with three internal knots 
placed at the 10th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of location-
speciﬁ c temperature distributions, and the lag-response 
curve with a natural cubic B-spline with an intercept and 
three internal knots placed at equally spaced values in the 
log scale. We extended the lag period to 21 days to include 
the long delay of the eﬀ ects of cold and to exclude deaths 
that were advanced by only a few days (harvesting eﬀ ect). 
We tested these modelling choices in sensitivity analysis.
We then reduced the association to the overall 
temperature–mortality association, cumulating the risk 
during the lag period.22 This step reduces the number of 
parameters to be pooled in the second-stage meta-analysis, 
and preserves the complexity of the estimated dependency, 
thus avoiding unnecessary simpliﬁ cation.
We pooled the estimated location-speciﬁ c overall 
cumulative exposure-response associations using a 
multivariate meta-analytical model.22,23 Previous studies 
have reported how climatological, socioeconomic, demo-
graphic, and infrastructural factors have a role in 
modiﬁ cation of the association between temperature and 
mortality.10 To account for the main features of such

eﬀ ect modiﬁ cation, we included location-speciﬁ c average 
temperature, temperature range, and indicators for country 
as meta-predictors in a multivariate meta-regression. We 
tested these eﬀ ects through a multivariate Wald test. We 
tested residual heterogeneity and reported it by the 
multivariate extension of Cochran Q test and I² statistic.23,24
We used the ﬁ tted meta-analytical model to derive the 
best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative 
exposure-response association in each location. The 
best linear unbiased prediction represents a trade-oﬀ  
between the location-speciﬁ c association provided by 
the ﬁ rst-stage regression and the pooled association. 
This approach allows areas with small daily mortality 
counts or short series, usually characterised by very 
imprecise estimates, to borrow information from larger 
populations that share similar characteristics.13,23,25
The 
minimum 
mortality 
temperature, 
which 
corresponds to a minimum mortality percentile between 
the ﬁ rst and the 99th percentiles, was derived from the 
best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative 
exposure-response association in each location. We 
referred to this value as the optimum temperature, and 
deemed it the reference for calculating the attributable 
risk by re-centring the quadratic B-spline that models the 
exposure-response. For each day of the series, in each 
location, 
we 
used 
the 
overall 
cumulative 
RR 
corresponding to each day’s temperature to calculate the 
attributable deaths and fraction of attributable deaths in 
the next 21 days, using a previously described method.26
The total attributable number of deaths caused by 
non-optimum temperatures is given by the sum of the 
contributions from all the days of the series, and its ratio 
with the total number of deaths provides the total 
attributable fraction. We calculated the components 
attributable to cold and heat by summing the subsets 
corresponding to days with temperatures lower or 
higher than the minimum mortality temperature. We 
further separated these components into moderate and 
extreme contributions by deﬁ ning extreme cold and 
heat as temperatures lower than the 2·5th location-
speciﬁ c percentile (extreme cold) and higher than the 
97·5th location-speciﬁ c percentile (extreme heat). These 
cutoﬀ s are consistent with previous deﬁ nitions of 
extreme weather, such as heatwaves.7,14,18,19 We deﬁ ned 
moderate temperatures as the ranges between the 
optimum temperature and these cutoﬀ s. We deﬁ ned 
other ranges using cutoﬀ s at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 
and 90th percentiles.
We calculated empirical CIs (eCIs) using Monte Carlo 
simulations, assuming a multivariate normal distribution 
of the best linear unbiased predictions of the reduced 
coeﬃ  cients. We reported algebraic equations and details 
elsewhere,26 and they are summarised in the appendix.

Results
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics from each 
country. The dataset included 74 225 200 deaths. As 
expected, the populations in diﬀ erent countries 
experienced a broad range of temperatures, with 
country-speciﬁ c averages ranging from 6·5°C in Canada 
to 27·6°C in Thailand. These temperatures are 
illustrative of regions characterised by diﬀ erent 
climates: from cold countries (Canada, Sweden, and to a 
lesser extent UK), through temperate latitudes in the 
Mediterranean (Spain and Italy), east Asia (South Korea 
and Japan), and southern-hemisphere areas (Australia), 
to tropical and subtropical areas (Brazil, Taiwan, and 
Thailand). Other large countries (China and USA) 
included locations with more heterogeneous climates.
Figure 1 shows overall cumulative exposure-response 
curves (best linear unbiased predictions) for 13 cities 
selected to represent each country, with the corresponding 
minimum mortality temperature and the cutoﬀ s to 
deﬁ ne extreme temperatures. The corresponding graphs 
for all 384 locations are reported in the appendix. The 
temperature distributions emphasise how the hot 
temperature range, although characterised by a high RR, 
consists of only a small proportion of days. The median 
minimum mortality percentile ranges were at about the 
80th and 90th percentiles for most countries, with the 
exception of the tropical and subtropical areas of Brazil, 
Taiwan, and Thailand, where it seemed to be near the 60th 
percentile (table 2). Risk increases slowly and linearly

temperature, although some locations (eg, London and 
Madrid) showed a higher increase for extreme cold than 
did the others. By contrast, risk generally escalated quickly 
and non-linearly at high temperatures.
Results 
from 
our 
multivariate 
meta-regression 
suggest that, although signiﬁ cant, residual heterogeneity 
is low after country indicators, average temperature, 
and temperature range had been included as 
meta-predictors, with an I² of 36·3%. Although all 
three predictors signiﬁ cantly modify the temperature–
mortality association, either in single-predictor or full 
models, the country indicators account for a much 
higher proportion of heterogeneity than do average 
temperature or temperature range (appendix).
The main results (table 2) were the estimated 
attributable fraction calculated as total and as separated 
components caused by cold and hot temperatures in each 
country (see appendix for location-speciﬁ c ﬁ gures). 
Overall, the total fraction of deaths caused by both heat 
and cold was 7·71% (95% eCI 7·43–7·91), although this 
fraction varied substantially between countries, with the 
highest attributable risk in Italy, China, and Japan, and 
the lowest estimates in Thailand, Brazil, and Sweden 
(table 2). Although the CI for Sweden was not signiﬁ cant, 
the results seemed more likely to be caused by the small 
dataset than by a diﬀ erent pattern. Cold was responsible 
for most of the burden (total estimate 7·29%, 95% eCI 
7·02–7·49%), while the fraction attributable to heat was 
small (0·42%, 0·39–0·44). This diﬀ erence was mainly 
caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with 
most of the mean daily temperatures being lower than 
the optimum value.
The attributable risk can be separated into components 
related to moderate and extreme temperatures (ﬁ gure 2). 
The appendix contains estimates for diﬀ erent temperature 
percentile ranges. In all countries, most of the mortality 
risk attributable to temperature was related to moderate 
cold, with an overall estimate of 6·66% (95% eCI 
6·41–6·86). Extreme temperatures (either cold or hot) 
were responsible for a small fraction, corresponding to 
0·86% (0·84–0·87%). These results are consistent with 
the exposure-response associations and temperature 
distributions in ﬁ gure 1. Although the range corres-
ponding to moderate cold had a comparatively low RR, it 
included the most days in the series. Our sensitivity 
analysis suggested that our results were not dependent 
on modelling assumptions (appendix).
Discussion
Our ﬁ ndings show that temperature is responsible for 
advancing a substantial fraction of deaths, corresponding 
to 7·71% of mortality in the selected countries within 
the study period. Most of this mortality burden was 
caused by days colder than the optimum temperature 
(7·29%), compared with days warmer than the optimum 
temperature (0·42%). Furthermore, most deaths were 
caused by exposure to moderately hot and cold 
temperatures, and the contribution of extreme days was 
comparatively low, despite increased RRs. The study 
was based on the largest dataset ever collected to assess 
temperature–health associations, and included more 
than 74 million deaths from 13 countries (panel). The 
analysis of data from 384 locations provides evidence for 
temperature-related mortality risk in a wide range of 
climates and populations with diﬀ erent demographic, 
socioeconomic, and infrastructural characteristics. A 
strength of the study was the application of new, ﬂ exible 
statistical models to characterise the temperature-
mortality association and pool estimates across 
locations. In particular, while previous studies relied on 
simpliﬁ cation of the exposure-response or lag structure, 
the approach we used here enabled us to estimate and 
pool non-linear and delayed dependencies and to 
identify the temperature of minimum mortality.
Comparison with previous studies that reported data 
for attributable deaths is limited by several factors, 
particularly the variation in study designs and modelling 
approaches and the use of alternative deﬁ nitions of 
attributable risk measures. Findings from studies that 
focused on speciﬁ c events or periods with extreme

temperatures suggest a mortality increase of 8·9–12·1% 
during heat waves and 12·8% during cold spells.16,17 
Investigators who extended the analysis to the whole 
summer season report estimates of 1·6–2·0% for 
attributable mortality caused by heat.13,19 Studies that 
include attributable risk measures for whole-year 
mortality, and thus adopt a comparable denominator, 
report values close to ours: Hajat and colleagues reported 
that the all-cause mortality attributable to heat was 
between 0·37% and 1·45% in three European cities,14 and 
Carson and colleagues15 estimated that 5·4% of deaths 
were attributable to cold but none to heat in London.
Various underlying mechanisms have been postulated 
to explain the increased mortality risk associated with 
exposure to high and low ambient temperature. 
Physiological eﬀ ects leading to heat-related deaths are not 
well known yet, and probably vary for diﬀ erent mortality 
causes. In the case of the association of heat with 
cardiovascular mortality, the cause accounting for the 
greatest burden, acute events seem to be triggered when 
the body exceeds its thermoregulatory threshold, after 
changes in heart rate, blood viscosity and coagulability, 
reductions in cerebral perfusion, and attenuated 
vasoconstrictor responsiveness.27 Heat also increases 
mortality risk for other causes: a suggested mechanism is 
through the alteration of ﬂ uid and electrolytic balance in 
people aﬀ ected by chronic diseases or in people with 
impaired responsiveness to environmental conditions.1,8 
These sudden physiological responses are consistent with 
the steep, supralinear increase in risk above the optimum 
temperature (ﬁ gure 1, appendix), which was associated 
with a comparatively high burden attributable to extremely 
high temperature. The biological processes that underlie 
cold-related mortality mainly have cardio vascular and 
respiratory eﬀ ects. Exposure to cold has been associated 
with cardiovascular stress by aﬀ ecting factors such as 
blood pressure and plasma ﬁ brinogen, vasoconstriction 
and blood viscosity, and inﬂ ammatory responses.28,29 
Similarly, 
cold 
induces 
bronchoconstriction 
and 
suppresses mucociliary defences and other immunological 
reactions, resulting in local inﬂ ammation and increased 
risk of respiratory infections.30 These physiological 
responses can persist for longer than those attributed to 
heat,28 and seem to produce mortality risks that follow a 
smooth, close-to-linear response, with most of the 
attributable risk occurring in moderately cold days.
Some limitations must be acknowledged. First, 
although this investigation includes populations with 
markedly diﬀ erent characteristics and living in a wide 
range of climates, the ﬁ ndings cannot be interpreted as 
globally representative. We did not include entire 
regions, such as Africa or the Middle East, and the 
assessment was mainly restricted to urban populations. 
Although our results suggest substantial intercountry 
variation in attributable risk for both heat and cold, the 
analysis did not characterise these diﬀ erences to 
identify determinants of susceptibility or resilience to 
the eﬀ ects of temperature. These limitations can be 
addressed in future research by extension of the dataset 
to populations living in other regions, and by collection 
of standardised measures of meta-variables for location-
speciﬁ c characteristics to be included in the second-
stage meta-regression. Results from these analyses 
would complement the evidence provided in this study.
We identiﬁ ed a substantial eﬀ ect of heat and cold on 
mortality, with attributable ﬁ gures that varied by country. 
The optimum temperature at which the risk is lowest 
was well above the median, and seemed to be increased 
in cold regions. Cold was responsible for a higher 
proportion of deaths than was heat, while moderate hot 
and cold temperatures represented most of the total 
health burden. Research on the association between 
human health and ambient temperature has so far 
focused mainly on the eﬀ ects of extreme heat, and public 
health plans have implemented policies and interventions 
designed almost exclusively for heatwave periods. Our 
results suggest that public-health policies and adaptation 
measures should be extended and refocused to take 
account of the whole range of eﬀ ects associated with 
temperature, although further research is needed to 
clarify how much of the excess mortality related to each 
component is preventable. Our study also provides a 
platform to improve and extend predictions of the eﬀ ects 
of climate change; our ﬁ ndings emphasise how a 
comprehensive assessment is needed to provide an 
appropriate estimate of the health consequences of 
various climate-change scenarios.
Panel: Research in context
Systematic review
We searched the literature to identify articles that reported estimates of the eﬀ ect of 
non-optimum ambient temperature on mortality and used attributable risk measures as 
the main eﬀ ect summary. We searched PubMed using combinations of the terms 
“temperature” or “heat” or “cold”, and “mortality” or “death*”, and “attributable” or 
“impact”. We searched papers written in English from inception to Dec 31, 2013. We then 
manually selected relevant articles by reading the abstracts. Although several studies13–19 
reported estimates of attributable risk, they used diﬀ erent deﬁ nitions of summary 
measures and used various designs and analytical methods, which made the comparison 
diﬃ  cult. Most of these investigations focused on heat-related health eﬀ ects, and few 
assessed the attributable component caused by cold temperatures. More importantly, these 
studies restricted their assessments to single cities or countries, and no study has so far 
provided a comprehensive assessment across populations exposed to diﬀ erent climates by 
use of consistent statistical approaches.
Interpretation
We report that non-optimum ambient temperature is responsible for substantial excess 
in mortality, with important diﬀ erences between countries. Although most previous 
research has focused on heat-related eﬀ ects, most of the attributable deaths were caused 
by cold temperatures. Despite the attention given to extreme weather events, most of 
the eﬀ ect happened on moderately hot and moderately cold days, especially moderately 
cold days. This evidence is important for improvements to public health policies aimed at 
prevention of temperature-related health consequences, and provides a platform to 
extend predictions on future eﬀ ects in climate-change scenarios.Articles

Executive summary
Pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease 
and premature death in the world today. Diseases caused 
by pollution were responsible for an estimated 9 million 
premature deaths in 2015—16% of all deaths worldwide—
three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, 
and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all 
wars and other forms of violence. In the most severely 
affected countries, pollution-related disease is responsible 
for more than one death in four.
Pollution disproportionately kills the poor and the 
vulnerable. Nearly 92% of pollution-related deaths occur 
in low-income and middle-income countries and, in 
countries at every income level, disease caused by 
pollution is most prevalent among minorities and the 
marginalised. Children are at high risk of pollution-
related disease and even extremely low-dose exposures to 
pollutants during windows of vulnerability in utero and 
in early infancy can result in disease, disability, and death 
in childhood and across their lifespan.
Despite its substantial effects on human health, the 
economy, and the environment, pollution has been 
neglected, especially in low-income and middle-income 
countries, and the health effects of pollution are under­
estimated in calculations of the global burden of disease. 
Pollution in low-income and middle-income countries 
that is caused by industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, 
and toxic chemicals has particularly been overlooked in 
both the international development and the global health 
agendas. Although more than 70% of the diseases 
caused by pollution are non-communicable diseases, 
inter­ventions against pollution are barely mentioned in 
the Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of 
Non-Communicable Diseases.
Pollution is costly. Pollution-related diseases cause 
productivity losses that reduce gross domestic product 
(GDP) in low-income to middle-income countries by up 
to 2% per year. Pollution-related disease also results in 
health-care costs that are responsible for 1·7% of 
annual health spending in high-income countries and 
for up to 7% of health spending in middle-income 
countries that are heavily polluted and rapidly 
developing. Welfare losses due to pollution are 
estimated to amount to US$4·6 trillion per year: 
6·2% of global economic output. The costs attributed to 
pollution-related disease will probably increase as 
additional associations between pollution and disease 
are identified.
Pollution endangers planetary health, destroys eco­
systems, and is intimately linked to global climate change. 
Fuel combustion—fossil fuel combustion in high-income 
and middle-income countries and burning of biomass in 
low-income countries—accounts for 85% of airborne 
particulate pollution and for almost all pollution by oxides 
of sulphur and nitrogen. Fuel combustion is also a major 
source of the greenhouse gases and short-lived climate 
pollutants that drive climate change. Key emitters of 
carbon dioxide, such as electricity-generating plants, 
chemical manufacturing facilities, mining operations, 
deforestation, and petroleum-powered vehicles, are also 
major sources of pollution. Coal is the world’s most 
polluting fossil fuel, and coal combustion is an important 
cause of both pollution and climate change.
In many parts of the world, pollution is getting worse. 
Household air and water pollution, the forms of pollution 
associated with profound poverty and traditional 
lifestyles, are slowly declining. However, ambient air 
pollution, chemical pollution, and soil pollution—the 
forms of pollution produced by industry, mining, 
electricity generation, mechanised agriculture, and 
petroleum-powered vehicles—are all on the rise, with the 
most marked increases in rapidly developing and 
industrialising 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries.
Chemical pollution is a great and growing global 
problem. The effects of chemical pollution on human 
health are poorly defined and its contribution to the global 
burden of disease is almost certainly underestimated. 
More than 140 000 new chemicals and pesticides have 
been synthesised since 1950. Of these materials, 
the 5000 that are produced in greatest volume have 
become widely dispersed in the environment and are 
responsible for nearly universal human exposure. Fewer 
than half of these high-production volume chemicals have 
undergone any testing for safety or toxicity, and rigorous 
pre-market evaluation of new chemicals has become 
mandatory in only the past decade and in only a few high-
income countries. The result is that chemicals and 
pesticides whose effects on human health and the 
environment were never examined have repeatedly been 
responsible for episodes of disease, death, and 
environmental degradation. Historical examples include 
lead, asbestos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and the ozone-
destroying chlorofluorocarbons. Newer synthetic chem­
icals that have entered world markets in the past

2–3 decades and that, like their predecessors, have 
undergone little pre-market evaluation threaten to repeat 
this history. They include developmental neurotoxicants, 
endocrine disruptors, chemical herbicides, novel insect­
icides, pharmaceutical wastes, and nanomaterials. 
Evidence for the capacity of these emerging chemical 
pollutants to cause harm to human health and the 
environment is beginning to become evident. These 
emerging chemicals are of great concern, and this concern 
is heightened by the increasing movement of chemical 
production to low-income and middle-income countries 
where public health and environmental protections are 
often scant. Most future growth in chemical production 
will occur in these countries. A further dimension of 
chemical pollution is the global archipelago of con­
taminated hot-spots: cities and communities, homes and 
schoolyards polluted by toxic chemicals, radionuclides, 
and heavy metals released into air, water, and soil by active 
and abandoned factories, smelters, mines, and hazardous 
waste sites.
Cities, 
especially 
rapidly 
growing 
cities 
in 
industrialising countries, are severely affected by 
pollution. Cities contain 55% of the world’s population; 
they account for 85% of global economic activity and they 
concentrate people, energy consumption, construction 
activity, industry, and traffic on a historically un­
precedented scale.
The good news is that much pollution can be 
eliminated, and pollution prevention can be highly 
cost-effective. High-income and some middle-income 
countries have enacted legislation and issued regulations 
mandating clean air and clean water, established 
chemical safety policies, and curbed their most flagrant 
forms of pollution. Their air and water are now cleaner, 
the blood lead concentrations of their children have 
decreased by more than 90%, their rivers no longer catch 
fire, their worst hazardous waste sites have been re­
mediated, and many of their cities are less polluted and 
more liveable. Health has improved and people in these 
countries are living longer. High-income countries have 
achieved this progress while increasing gross domestic 
product (GDP) by nearly 250%. The challenge for high-
income nations today is to further reduce pollution, 
decarbonise their economies, and reduce the resources 
used in achieving prosperity. The claim that pollution 
control stifles economic growth and that poor countries 
must pass through a phase of pollution and disease on 
the road to prosperity has repeatedly been proven 
to be untrue.
Pollution mitigation and prevention can yield large net 
gains both for human health and the economy. Thus, air 
quality improvements in the high-income countries have 
not only reduced deaths from cardiovascular and 
respiratory disease but have also yielded substantial 
economic gains. In the USA, an estimated US$30 in 
benefits (range, $4–88) has been returned to the economy 
for every dollar invested in air pollution control 
since 1970, which is an aggregate benefit of $1·5 trillion 
against an investment of $65 billion. Similarly, the 
removal of lead from gasoline has returned an estimated 
$200 billion (range, $110 billion–300 billion) to the US 
economy each year since 1980, an aggregate benefit to-
date of over $6 trillion through the increased cognitive 
function and enhanced economic productivity of 
generations of children exposed since birth to only low 
amounts of lead.
Pollution control will advance attainment of many of the 
sustainable development goals (SDGs), the 17 goals 
established by the United Nations to guide global 
development in the 21st century. In addition to improving 
health in countries around the world (SDG 3), pollution 
control will help to alleviate poverty (SDG 1), improve 
access to clean water and improve sanitation (SDG 6), 
promote social justice (SDG 10), build sustainable cities 
and communities (SDG 11), and protect land and water 
(SDGs 14 and 15). Pollution control, in turn, will benefit 
from efforts to slow the pace of climate change (SDG 13) 
by transitioning to a sustainable, circular economy that 
relies on non-polluting renewable energy, on efficient 
industrial processes that produce little waste, and on 
transport systems that restrict use of private vehicles in 
cities, enhance public transport, and promote active travel.
Many of the pollution control strategies that have 
proven cost-effective in high-income and middle-income 
countries can be exported and adapted by cities and 
countries at every level of income. These strategies are 
based in law, policy, regulation, and technology, are 
science-driven, and focus on the protection of public 
health. The application of these approaches boosts 
economies and increases GDP. The strategies include 
targeted reductions in emissions of pollutants, transitions 
to non-polluting, renewable sources of energy, the 
adoption of non-polluting technologies for production 
and transportation, and the development of efficient, 
accessible, and affordable public transportation systems. 
Application of the best of these strategies in carefully 
planned and well resourced campaigns can enable low-
income and middle-income countries to avoid many of 
the harmful consequences of pollution, leapfrog the 
worst of the human and ecological disasters that have 
plagued industrial development in the past, and improve 
the health and wellbeing of their people. Pollution 
control provides an extraordinary opportunity to improve 
the health of the planet. It is a winnable battle.
The aim of this Lancet Commission on pollution and 
health is to raise global awareness of pollution, end 
neglect of pollution-related disease, and mobilise the 
resources and the political will needed to effectively 
confront pollution. To advance this aim, we make six 
recommendations. Additional recommendations are 
presented at the end of each Section. The key 
recommendations are:

planning processes. Pollution can no longer be viewed as 
an isolated environmental issue, but is a transcendent 
problem that affects the health and wellbeing of entire 
societies. Leaders of government at all levels (mayors, 
governors, and heads of state) need, therefore, to elevate 
pollution control to a high priority within their agendas; 
to integrate pollution control into development planning; 
to actively engage in pollution planning and prioritisation; 
and to link prevention of pollution with commitments to 
advance the SDGs, to slow the pace of climate change, 
and to control non-communicable diseases. 
Targets and timetables are essential, and governments 
at all levels need to establish short-term and long-term 
targets for pollution control and to support the agencies 
and regulations needed to attain these goals. Legally 
mandated regulation is an essential tool, and both the 
polluter-pays principle and an end to subsidies and tax 
breaks for polluting industries need to be integral 
components of pollution control programmes.
 (2) Mobilise, increase, and focus the funding and the 
international technical support dedicated to pollution 
control. The amount of funding from international 
agencies, binational donors, and private foundations that 
is directed to control of pollution, especially pollution 
from the industrial, transport, chemical, and mining 
sectors in low-income and middle-income countries is 
meagre and needs to be substantially increased. The 
resources directed to pollution management need to be 
increased within cities and countries as well as 
internationally. Options for increasing the international 
development funding directed to pollution include 
expansion of climate change and non-communicable 
disease control programmes to include pollution control 
and development of new funding mechanisms.
In addition to increased funding, international 
technical support for pollution control is needed in 
prioritisation and planning of processes to tackle 
pollution within rapidly industrialising cities and 
countries; in development of regulatory and enforcement 
strategies; in building technical capacity; and in direct 
interventions, in which such actions are urgently needed 
to save lives or can substantially leverage local action and 
resources. 
Financing 
and 
technical 
assistance 
programmes need to be tracked and measured to assess 
their cost-effectiveness and to enhance accountability.
(3) Establish systems to monitor pollution and its 
effects on health. Data collected at the national and local 
levels are essential for measuring pollution levels, 
identifying and apportioning appropriate responsibility 
to each pollution source, evaluating the success of 
interventions, guiding enforcement, informing civil 
society and the public, and assessing progress toward 
goals. The incorporation of new technologies, such as 
satellite imaging and data mining, into pollution 
monitoring can increase efficiency, expand geographic 
range, and lower costs. Open access to these data is 
essential, and consultation with civil society and the 
public will ensure accountability and build public 
awareness. With even limited monitoring programmes, 
consisting of only one or a few sampling stations, 
governments and civil society organisations can 
document pollution, and track progress toward short-
term and long-term control targets. Pollution control 
metrics should be integrated into SDG dashboards and 
other monitoring platforms so that successes and 
experiences can be shared.
(4) Build multi-sectoral partnerships for pollution 
control. Broad-based partnerships across several 
govern­ment agencies and between governments and 
the private sector can powerfully advance pollution 
control and accelerate the development of clean energy 
sources and clean technologies that will ultimately 
prevent 
pollution 
at 
source. 
Cross-ministerial 
collaborations that involve health and environment 
ministries, but also ministries of finance, energy, 
agriculture, development, and trans­port are essential. 
Collaborations between govern­ments and industry can 
catalyse innovation, create incent­ives for cleaner 
production technologies and cleaner energy production, 
and incentivise transition to a more sustainable, 
circular economy. The private sector is in a unique 
position to provide leadership in the design and 
development of clean, non-polluting, sustainable tech­
nologies for pollution control, and to engage construct­
ively with governments to reward innovation and 
create incentives.
(5) Integrate pollution mitigation into planning 
processes for non-communicable diseases. Interventions 
against pollution need to be a core component of the 
Global Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of 
Non-Communicable Diseases.
(6) Research pollution and pollution control. Research 
is needed to understand and control pollution and to 
drive change in pollution policy. Pollution-related 
research should:
•	 Explore emerging causal links between pollution, 
disease, and subclinical impairment, for example 
between ambient air pollution and dysfunction of the 
central nervous system in children and the elderly;
•	 Quantify the global burden of disease associated with 
chemical pollutants of known toxicity such as lead, 
mercury, chromium, arsenic, asbestos, and benzene;
•	 Identify and characterise the adverse health outcomes 
caused by new and emerging chemical pollutants, 
such as developmental neurotoxicants, endocrine 
disruptors, novel insecticides, chemical herbicides, 
and pharmaceutical wastes;
•	 Identify and map pollution exposures particularly in 
low-income and middle-income countries;
•	 Improve estimates of the economic costs of pollution 
and pollution-related disease; and
•	 Quantify the health and economic benefits of inter­
ventions against pollution and balance these benefits 
against the costs of interventions.

Introduction
Pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the 
Anthropocene epoch. Like climate change, biodiversity 
loss, ocean acidification, desertification, and depletion of 
the world’s fresh water supply, pollution endangers the 
stability of the Earth’s support systems and threatens the 
continuing survival of human societies.1 Pollution, 
especially pollution caused by industrial emissions, 
vehicular exhausts, and toxic chemicals, has increased 
sharply in the past 500 years, and the largest increases 
today are seen in low-income and middle-income 
countries. Yet despite its great and growing magnitude, 
industrial, 
vehicular, 
and 
chemical 
pollution 
in 
developing countries has been largely overlooked in 
international development and global health agendas, 
and programmes for pollution control have received little 
attention or resources from either international agencies 
or philanthropic donors. Pollution is now a substantial 
problem that endangers the health of billions, degrades 
the Earth’s ecosystems, undermines the economic 
security of nations, and is responsible for an enormous 
global burden of disease, disability, and premature death.
Pollution is intimately linked to global climate change.2,3 
Fuel combustion—fossil fuel combustion in high-
income and middle-income countries, and biomass 
burning in inefficient cookstoves, open fires, agricultural 
burns, forest burning,4,5 and obsolete brick kilns in low-
income countries—accounts for 85% of airborne 
particulate pollution and for almost all pollution by 
oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. Fuel combustion is the 
major source of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate 
pollutants that are the main anthropogenic drivers of 
global climate change (appendix pp 1–11).6 
Pollution is very costly; it is responsible for productivity 
losses, health-care costs, and costs resulting from 
damages to ecosystems. But despite the great magnitude 
of these costs, they are largely invisible and often are not 
recognised as caused by pollution.7 The productivity 
losses of pollution-related diseases are buried in labour 
statistics. The health-related costs of pollution are hidden 
in hospital budgets.8 The result is that the full costs of 
pollution are not appreciated, are often not counted, and 
are not available to rebut one-sided, economically based 
arguments against pollution control.7,9
The nature of pollution is changing and, in many 
places around the world, it is worsening. These changes 
reflect increased energy consumption, the increased use 
of new materials and technologies, the rapid industrial­
isation of low-income and middle-income countries, and 
the global movement of populations from rural areas 
into cities. Household air and water pollution, the forms 
of pollution that were historically associated with 
profound poverty and traditional lifestyles, are slowly 
declining. However, ambient air pollution, chemical 
pollution, and soil pollution, are all in­creasing.10,11 Key 
drivers of these types of pollution are: the uncontrolled 
growth of cities;12 rising demands for energy; increasing 
mining, smelting, and deforestation; the global spread 
of toxic chemicals; progressively heavier applications of 
insecticides and herbicides; and an increasing use of 
petroleum-powered cars, trucks, and buses. Increases in 
ambient air, soil, and chemical pollution over the past 
500 years can be directly attributed to the currently 
prevalent, 
linear, 
take-make-use-dispose 
economic 
paradigm—termed by Pope Francis “the throwaway 
culture”13—in which natural resources and human 
capital are viewed as abundant and expendable, and the 
consequences of their reckless exploitation are given 
little heed.14,15 This economic paradigm focuses single-
mindedly on GDP14 and is ultimately unsustainable: this 
model fails to link the economic development of human 
societies to social justice or to maintenance of the 
Earth’s resources.1,2,15
Scientific understanding of pollution and its effects on 
health have greatly advanced.16,17 New technologies, 
including satellite imaging,18 have enhanced the ability to 
map pollution, measure pollution levels remotely, 
identify sources of pollution, and track temporal trends.17 
Sophisticated chemical analyses have refined under­
standing of the composition of pollution and elucidated 
links between pollution and disease.19 Large prospective, 
multi-year epidemiological studies, beginning with the 
studies by Pope and colleagues20 in Utah and the Harvard 
Six-Cities study,21 have showed that pollution is associated 
with a much wider range of diseases, particularly non-
communicable diseases, than was previously recognised. 
Pollution is now understood to be an important causative 
agent of many non-communicable diseases including 
asthma, cancer, neurodevelopmental disorders, and birth 
defects in children (appendix p 11); and heart disease, 
stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
cancer in adults.22–34 In the absence of aggressive 
intervention, the number of deaths due to ambient air 
pollution are on track to increase by more than 50% 
by 2050.35
Despite these advances in knowledge, there are still 
many gaps in information about pollution and its effects 
on health. These gaps include an absence of information 
in many countries on pollution levels and the prevalence 
of pollution-related disease; poor knowledge of the toxic 
effects of many chemicals in common use, especially 
newer classes of chemicals;36,37 incomplete information 
on the scope of exposures and burden of disease 
associated with toxic exposures at contaminated sites;38 
and inadequate information on the possible delayed 
effects of toxic exposures sustained in early life.39 Also 
unknown is the exact shape of the dose-response 
functions used to estimate the relative risk of disease 
associated with pollution. In the case of fine-particulate 
air pollution, for example, the shape of the exposure–
response association at both very low and very high 
exposure levels and the assumptions that underlie the 
integrated exposure–response function40 used to estimate 
the relative risks of fine particulate (PM2·5) exposure in

both the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study41,42 and 
WHO analyses are not precisely known.23
The good news is that, despite the great magnitude of 
pollution and current gaps in knowledge about its 
effects on human health and the environment, pollution 
can be prevented. Pollution is not the inevitable con­
sequence of economic development. High-income and 
some middle-income countries have enacted legislation 
and issued regulations that build on new scientific 
knowledge about pollution and its health effects. These 
laws and regulations are based on the polluter-pays 
principle; they mandate clean air and clean water and set 
standards at levels that prevent disease, have established 
policies for chemical safety, have banned certain 
hazardous pollutants such as lead, asbestos, and DDT, 
and have effected clean-up of the worst of the hazardous 
waste sites.
Many of these proven, cost-effective control strategies 
are now ready to be exported and adapted for use by cities 
and countries at every level of income. Their application 
in carefully planned and well resourced campaigns can 
enable developing and industrialising countries to avoid 
many of the harmful consequences of pollution—to 
leapfrog over the worst of the human and ecological 
disasters that have plagued industrial development in the 
past—and to improve human health and wellbeing.
Contrary to the oft-repeated claim that pollution 
control stifles economic growth, pollution prevention 
has, in fact, been shown repeatedly to be highly cost-
effective. In the USA, for example, concentrations of six 
common air pollutants have been reduced by about 70% 
since passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 and, in the 
same time period, GDP has increased by nearly 250% 
(figure 1).43 Every dollar invested in control of ambient 
air pollution in the USA not only improves health,44 but 
also is estimated to yield US$30 in economic benefits 
(95% CI $4–88).45
Another example of the economic benefits of addressing 
pollution is seen in the consequences of removing lead 
from gasoline in the USA. This intervention began 
in 1975 and, within a decade, had reduced the mean blood 
concentration of lead in the population by more than 90% 
(figure 2), almost eliminated childhood lead poisoning, 
and increased the cognitive capacity of all American 
children born since 1980 by 2–5 IQ points.46 This gain in 
intelligence has in­creased national economic productivity 
and will yield an economic benefit of US$200 billion 
(range $110 billion–300 billion) over the lifetimes of each 
annual cohort of children born since 1980,46 an aggregate 
benefit to-date of over $6 trillion.47,48 
Yet, despite its harmful effects on human health, the 
economy, and the environment and, notwithstanding the 
clear evidence that it can be cost-effectively controlled, 
pollution (especially industrial, vehicular, and chemical 
pollution in low-income and middle-income countries) 
has been largely neglected.49,50 Work to control the 
biological contamination of drinking water51–54 and to curb 
household air pollution produced by poorly ventilated 
cookstoves55–57 has occurred over many years and those 
efforts, along with new vaccines, antibiotics, and treatment 
protocols, have contributed to promising reductions in 
the morbidity and mortality associated with the traditional 
forms of pollution.58–60 However, the burgeoning problems 
of air, water, and soil pollution produced by modern 
industry, 
electricity 
generation, 
mining, 
smelting, 
petroleum-powered motor vehicles, and chemical and 
pesticide releases in low-income and middle-income 
countries have received almost no international attention 
or resources.49,50 Budgets for foreign aid from the European 
Commission, the US Agency for International Develop­
ment, and most bilateral development agencies, private 
philanthropists, and major foundations have not included 
substantive funding for control of industrial, mining and 
transport-related pollution.50,61 The national and local 
resources directed toward the study and control of 
industrial, chemical, and vehicular pollution and the 
diseases that they cause within cities and countries are

often meagre.62 Lastly, interventions against pollution are 
barely mentioned in the Global Action Plan for the 
Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases,63 
which is a major missed opportunity.
Several factors have contributed to the neglect of 
pollution. A persistent impediment has been the flawed 
conventional wisdom that pollution and disease are the 
unavoidable consequences of economic development, the 
so-called “environmental Kuznets hypothesis” (panel 1).64–73 
This Commission vigorously challenges that claim as 
a flawed and obsolete notion formulated decades ago 
when pop­ulations and urban centres were much smaller 
than they are today, the nature, sources, and health 
effects of pollution were very different, and cleaner 
fuels and modern production technologies were not yet 
available.
Fragmentation of the agendas for environmental health 
and pollution control is another factor that has contributed 
to neglect of pollution. In many countries, responsibility 
for pollution-related disease falls between ministries of 
health and ministries for the environment, and too often 
belongs to neither. Air, water, soil, and chemical pollution 
are each regulated by different agencies and studied by 
different research groups. The consequence is that the 
full scale of pollution and its contribution to the global 
burden of disease are not recognised. The separation of 
public health from environmental protection has also 
slowed the growth of research on pollution-related 
disease, led to the virtual elimination of coursework in 
environmental health science from the curricula of most 
medical and nursing schools, and impeded the develop­
ment of environmental health policy.
In the international development agenda, neglect of 
the modern forms of pollution can be traced to the 
historical origins of overseas development assistance 
programmes whose goals, when they were launched at 
the end of World War 2, were to reduce poverty, improve 
maternal and child health, and combat infectious 
diseases in an era when much of the world was devastated 
and more than 50% of countries were classified as low-
income.49,50 At that time, the predominant health 
problems of the developing world were infectious 
diseases and maternal and child mortality, and many 
overseas development programmes have been highly 
successful and have contributed to the control of these 
problems.74 However, these programmes were never 
intended to address the more modern forms of pollution.
Finally, the opposition of powerful vested interests has 
been a perennial barrier to control of pollution, especially 
industrial, vehicular, and chemical pollution. These 
entrenched interests, which often exert disproportionate 
influence on government policy, impugn the science 
linking pollution to disease, manufacture doubt about 
the effectiveness of interventions, and paralyse govern­
mental efforts to establish standards, impose pollution 
taxes, and enforce laws and regulations.75 These interests 
act both within countries and internationally.
The aim of this Lancet Commission on pollution and 
health is to end the neglect of pollution, especially of the 
modern forms of pollution, in low-income and middle-
income countries, to focus the world’s attention onto the 
silent threat of pollution-related disease, and to mobilise 
the national and international resources and the political 
will needed to effectively confront pollution.
To accomplish this aim and to mobilise the resources 
that will be needed to control pollution around the world, 
we have reviewed data on the health effects and economic 
costs of all forms of pollution: pollution of air, water, and 
soil, pollution in the workplace, and pollution by toxic 
chemicals (appendix p 15). We have also examined the 
links between pollution and poverty, injustice, and 
inequality. Finally, this Commission presents examples 
of cost-effective, proven strategies that can be adapted by 
cities and countries at every level of income to control 
pollution and prevent disease (appendix pp 63–107).
The work of this Commission on pollution and health 
builds upon work undertaken in the past decade by 
international organisations and bi-national funders to 
address the challenges of modern-day pollution, such as 
the World Bank Water and Sanitation Programme.76,77 
WHO has established a Department of Public Health 
Panel 1: The environmental Kuznets curve
The Kuznets curve, developed by economist Simon Kuznets (1901–85), describes the 
association between economic inequality and per capita income over the course of economic 
development.64 This curve illustrates Kuznets’ hypothesis that, as a society develops from a 
primarily agrarian to an urban, industrialised economy, market forces first increase and then, 
at a so-called “turning point” of per-capita income, decreases the overall degree of economic 
inequality in the society. These trends are shown as an inverted U-shaped curve.65 
The Kuznets hypothesis has been extended to environmental economics. Here, it is 
postulated that pollution and environmental degradation must increase in early stage 
economic development, that pollution will continue to increase up to a threshold of 
per-capita income, and that pollution will then decrease as the economy continues to 
grow. The postulated result is that high income and economic growth eventually lead to 
environmental improvements. This extension of Kuznets’ hypothesis has become 
entrenched as conventional wisdom in global environmental policy.66,67
Despite the great certitude with which the environmental Kuznets hypothesis is sometimes 
promulgated, empirical and theoretical research finds that the historical evidence in support 
of this hypothesis is uneven, and that the underlying statistical methods are weak.70–72 
Additional shortcomings are that the environmental Kuznets hypothesis fails to consider 
the movement of polluting industries from high-income to low-income and 
middle-income countries,68 does not consider the health and environmental effects of 
modern classes of pollutants such as chemical carcinogens, neurotoxicants, and 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals,69–73 and does not consider the potential benefits to human 
health and the environment of newer, non-polluting energy sources.
The conclusions from this analysis are that pollution is not the unavoidable consequence 
of economic development, and that it is much more important to formulate sound laws, 
policies, and regulations to control pollution than to wait for an economy to reach a 
magical tipping point that will solve the problems of environmental degradation and 
pollution-related disease. The goal of this Commission is to catalyse the formulation of 
such policies.

and the Environment, which has become a global leader 
in documenting the effects of environmental threats to 
children’s health.78,79 The UN Development Programme 
has taken on many components of the pollution control 
agenda. The World Bank financially supports several 
projects to control pollution. The UN Environment 
Programme also supports several programmes to control 
chemical pollution, some in partnership with WHO, and 
supports and oversees international agreements limiting 
the manufacture, environmental release, and global 
transport of persistent pollutants,80 pesticides, hazardous 
waste, and mercury. The Strategic Approach to 
International Chemicals Management, housed within 
the UN Environment Programme, provides a platform 
for discussion on control of chemical pollution and toxic 
waste among a broad range of stakeholders (appendix 
pp 13–14). These global advances in controlling ambient 
air, chemical, and vehicular pollution are welcome81 and 
have produced important gains, such as phasing lead out 
from gasoline, endorsed by the Partnership for clean 
fuels and vehicles, incorporating air pollution into the 
health agenda,82 establishing programmes to control the 
addition of lead to paint,83 and creating a pollution-
focused trust fund within the World Bank.
Pollution defined
This Commission defines pollution as unwanted, often 
dangerous, material that is introduced into the Earth’s 
environment as the result of human activity, that 
threatens human health, and that harms ecosystems; 
this definition is based on a definition of pollution 
developed by the European Union.84
To provide a framework for organising scientific 
knowledge about pollution and its effects on human 
health and to help focus pollution-related research, this 
Commission has developed the concept of the pollutome 
(figure 3). The pollutome is defined as the totality of all 
forms of pollution that have the potential to harm human 
health. The pollutome can be viewed as a fully contained 
(nested) subset of the exposome.85,86 This model includes 
pollutant exposures during gestation, infancy, childhood, 
adol­escence, adult life (including occupational exposures), 
and old age.
Because knowledge about the health effects of pollution 
varies by pollution type and ranges from the well 
characterised and quantified to the still emerging, we 
have divided the pollutome into three zones.
Zone 1 includes well established pollution–disease 
pairs, for which there are robust estimates of their 
contributions to the global burden of disease. The 
associations between ambient air pollution and non-
communicable disease are the prime example.23
Zone 2 includes the emerging effects of known 
pollutants, where evidence of causation is building, but 
associations between exposures and disease are not yet 
fully characterised and the burden of disease has not yet 
been quantified. Examples include associations between 
PM2·5 air pollution and diabetes,24–26 pre-term birth,27–29 
and diseases of the central nervous system, including 
autism in children,3,30–32 and dementia in the elderly.29,33 
Soil pollution by heavy metals and toxic chemicals at 
contaminated industrial and mining sites provides 
another example of a potentially important, but not yet 
fully characterised or quantified source of pollution-
related disease.38,87
Zone 3 includes new and emerging pollutants,36,37 most 
of them chemical pollutants whose effects on human 
health are only beginning to be recognised and are not yet 
quantified. Several of these chemicals have become widely 
disseminated in the environment, and many are detectable 
in the bodies of most persons examined in national 
surveys, such as the Centers for Disease Control’s 
national biomonitoring programme in the United States. 
At least some of these chemical pollutants appear to have 
potential to cause global epidemics of disease, disability, 
and death. This zone includes developmental neuro­
toxicants;37,88 endocrine disruptors;89–92 new classes of 
pesticides such as the neonicotinoids;93 chemical herbi­
cides such as glyphosate and nano-particles; and pharma­
ceutical wastes.94–96 These emerging chemical pollu­tants 
are discussed in detail in the appendix of this 
report (pp 2–11).
The list of diseases attributed to pollution will probably 
continue to expand as the environmental distributions 
and health effects of newer chemical pollutants are better 
defined and new exposure–disease associations are 
discovered. The health effects of pollution that are 
currently recognised and quantified could thus be the tip 
of a much larger iceberg.88 As more research becomes 
available, some pollution–disease pairs that are currently 
placed in zones 2 and 3 of the pollutome could move up to

burden of disease. The numbers of deaths attributable to 
the forms of pollution included in zones 2 and 3 are 
unknown.
This Commission’s work has been informed by the 
work of previous Lancet Commissions and Series, notably 
the Commission on Investing in Health,72 the 
Commission on the Political Origins of Health Inequity,73 
the Commission on Health and Climate Change,97 and 
the Series on Public Health Benefits of Climate Change 
Mitigation Policies.98 This Commission’s deliberations 
were guided particularly closely by the findings of The 
Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary 
Health15 whose 2015 report described how human activity 
is changing the global environment, increasing risk of 
disease, and threatening the conditions that, ultimately, 
sustain all life on Earth.
This Commission was guided further by influential 
reports from international agencies, among them the 
2016 report from WHO,99 Preventing Disease through 
Health Environments, the World Bank’s Shock Waves 
report100 on climate change and global poverty, the World 
Bank’s report,77 Clean Air and Healthy Lungs, and the 
United Nations Environment report,101 Costs of Inaction 
on the Sound Management of Chemicals.
This report is organised into five Sections. Section 1 
synthesises information on the burden of disease 
attributable to pollution using data from the GBD 2015 
Study41,42 coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics 
and Evaluation, and supplemented by data from WHO99,102 
and from Pure Earth.38 Section 2 examines data on the 
economic costs of pollution and presents a detailed 
analysis of the economic losses that result from pollution-
related disease. Section 3 examines the links between 
pollution, disease, and poverty and documents the 
marked inequities that characterise the global distrib­
ution of pollution and pollution-related disease and the 
disproportionate effects of pollution on children, the 
poor, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations. 
Section 4 presents pathways and priorities, case studies, 
and proven interventions that can be adopted and 
deployed to control pollution, prevent disease, and 
advance economic development. Section 5 outlines the 
Commission’s plans for future initiatives.
Sustainable long-term control of pollution will require 
that societies at every level of income move away from 
the prevalent resource-intensive, and inherently wasteful, 
linear 
take-make-use-dispose 
economic 
paradigm, 
towards a new paradigm rooted in the concept of the 
circular economy (panel 2).15,103,104 In a circular economy, 
pollution is reduced through the creation of durable, 
long-lasting products, the reduction of waste by large-
scale recycling, reuse, and repair, the removal of 
distorting subsidies, the replacement of hazard­ous 
materials with safer alternatives, and strict enforce­ment 
of pollution taxes.105 A circular economy conserves and 
increases resources, rather than taking and depleting 
them. This societal transition is essential for promoting 
smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth that reduces 
pollution, promotes health, and prevents disease.104
Limitations of the Commission
The Commission’s economic analysis does not include 
information about the costs of environmental damage 
caused by pollution. The Commission recognises that 
the ecological damages due to pollution are substantial, 
but considered analyses of the costs of these damages to 
fall outside of the scope of our work.
Levels of pollution are changing and pollution caused 
by industrial, vehicular, and chemical emissions is 
increasing in many rapidly developing countries, but the 
Commission’s analysis is based on data from the 2015 
Global Burden of Disease study, information that is now 
2 years old. 
Section 1: The burden of disease attributable to 
pollution
In this Section, we review data for the global burden of 
disease and death attributable to pollution.23,38,42,99,106
Methods
This review of the burden of disease and premature 
death due to pollution is based on a method for assessing 
disease burden that was developed in the 1980s by 
Panel 2: Circular economy
A circular economy is an economic model that decouples 
development from the consumption of non-renewable 
resources and minimises the generation of pollution and 
other forms of waste by recycling and reuse.104 In a fully 
circular economy, the only new inputs are renewable 
materials, and all non-renewable materials are recycled. 
The underlying assumption is that waste is an inherent 
inefficiency, a loss of materials from the system, and thus a 
cost.104 Transition towards a circular economy will reduce 
pollution-related disease and improve health.
The three core principles of the circular economy are 
preservation of natural capital by reducing use of 
non-renewable resources and ecosystem management; 
optimisation of resource yields by circulating products and 
materials so that they are shared and their lifecycles 
extended; and fostering system effectiveness by designing 
out pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and toxic materials 
that damage health.
The steps needed for transition towards a circular economy 
include large-scale transition to non-polluting sources of 
energy (wind, solar, and tidal), the production of durable 
products that require lower quantities of materials and less 
energy to manufacture than those being produced at present; 
incentivisation of recycling, re-use, and repair; and 
replacement of hazardous materials with safer alternatives.15The Lancet Commissions

WHO.107,108 The core of this approach is the disability-
adjusted life-year (DALY) concept, a summary metric of 
population health that combines information on 
mortality and disease into a single number to represent 
the health of a population, thus permitting comparisons 
of disease burden between countries, between diseases, 
and over time. The DALY method is at the core of the 
GBD project, a multinational study initiated by WHO in 
partnership with the World Bank and the Harvard 
School of Public Health,108 and sustained today by 
WHO102 and the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation.41,42
To examine the global burden of disease attributable to 
pollution risk factors, this Commission has relied 
principally on the 2015 estimates from the GBD 
study,41,42,106 coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics 
and Evaluation. We also examine data from the 2012 WHO 
analysis99,102,109,110 of the global burden of disease caused by 
living and working in unhealthy environments.
Following the standard conservative practice of 
the GBD study42,106 and WHO,99 this Commission has 
restricted its review to combinations of pollution risk 
factors and disease for which there is convincing or 
probable evidence of causal association. For this reason, 
numbers presented are likely to be underestimates of the 
full burden of disease attributable to the pollutome 
(figure 3).
In reviewing data on the burden of disease attributable 
to soil pollution caused by toxic chemicals and heavy 
metals at contaminated sites, this Commission has relied 
on information provided by the Blacksmith Institute/
Pure Earth Toxic Sites Identification programme.38 
This programme obtains data on pollution caused by 
chemicals and metals at contaminated sites through 
field studies that use a protocol adapted from a US 
Environmental Protection Agency assessment tool.111 
Two particularly common types of contaminated sites are 
used lead-acid battery recycling sites, where lead is the 
principal pollutant, and artisanal and small-scale gold 
mining sites, where the principal pollutant is elemental 
mercury (which is used to extract gold from ore). We 
used the methods of Ericson and colleagues111 to assess 
the burden of disease associated with lead-acid battery 
recycling sites, and the methods and data of Steckling 
and colleagues112,113 to assess the burden of disease 
associated with gold mining sites114–116 These methods are 
described in detail in the appendix (pp 16–19).
The pollution risk factors examined by the Commission 
were: (1) air pollution: household air pollution, ambient 
fine particulate pollution (PM2·5), and tropospheric ozone 
pollution; (2) water pollution: unsafe sanitation, and 
unsafe water sources; (3) soil, chemical, and heavy metal 
pollution: lead (including contaminated sites polluted by 
lead from battery recycling operations), and mercury 
from gold mining; and (4) occupational pollution: 
occupational carcinogens, and occupational particulates, 
gases, and fumes.
In reviewing disease burden in relation to national 
income, we have relied on the 2015 World Bank income 
classifications (high, upper middle, lower middle, and 
low). In reviewing disease burden in relation to geo­
graphical region, we have grouped countries using the 
regional groupings defined by WHO (Africa, eastern 
Mediterranean, Europe, Americas, southeast Asia, and 
western Pacific).
To examine temporal trends in the global burden of 
disease that are attributable to different forms of pollution, 
we have divided pollution into two broad cate­
gories: pollution linked to poverty and pollution linked to 
industrial development. Pollution linked to poverty 
includes household air pollution, unsafe water sources, 
and inadequate sanitation, the forms of pollution 
associated with profound poverty and trad­itional lifestyles 
in low-income and middle-income countries. Pollution 
linked to industrial development includes pollution 
produced by industrial emissions, vehicular exhausts, and 
chemical releases, and includes ambient fine part­
iculate (PM2·5) pollution, tropospheric ozone pollution, 
toxic occupational exposures, and soil pollution caused by 
heavy metals and toxic chemicals, including lead.
Main findings
The GBD study42 estimates that pollution-related disease 
was responsible for 9 million premature deaths in 
2015—16% of total global mortality (table 1).42,99,102 The 
GBD study also estimates that disease caused by all 
forms of pollution was responsible for 268 million 
DALYs—254 million years of life lost and 14 million years 
lived with disability.106 This information is available by 
country and region and is presented in the appendix.
WHO estimates that, in 2012, unhealthy environments 
were responsible for 12·6 million deaths worldwide—23% 
of total global mortality—and for 26% of deaths in 
children younger than 5 years.99,102,109,110
The most important finding to be drawn from these 
two analyses is that both the GBD study and WHO find 
that pollution is a major cause of disease, disability, and 
premature death. The GBD study reports that pollution 
was responsible for an estimated 9·0 million deaths 
in 2015, whereas the WHO analysis concludes that 
living in unhealthy environments was responsible for 
12·6 million deaths in 2012.
The difference between these two estimates of total 
mortality attributable to environmental factors mainly 
reflects differing definitions of environment. This 
Commission focuses strictly on pollution-related 
disease, as defined above. By contrast, the WHO def­
inition of environment is broader and encompasses 
several risk factors that were not included in this 
Commission’s analysis, including road accidents, 
ultraviolet and ionising radi­ation, noise, electromagnetic 
fields, occupational psycho­social risks, built environ­
ments, agricultural methods, and man-made climate 
and ecosystem change. Risk factors that were includedThe Lancet Commissions
www.thelancet.com    Vol 391   February 3, 2018	
471
in the WHO analysis and not in this Commission 
account for more than 3 million deaths each year, thus 
explaining most of the apparent discrepancy between 
the two estimates (panel 3).117–120
Some specific differences are seen between the two 
sets of estimates (figure 4).42,99 For example, the GBD 
study estimates that 4·2 million deaths in 2015 were 
because of ambient air pollution, whereas WHO 
attributes 3·7 million deaths in 2012 to this risk factor. 
The two analyses relied on similar approaches to 
comparative risk assessment, on the same sources of 
exposure data, and on the same integrated exposure–
response functions40 but, in 2014, the GBD study made 
changes to their computational methodology,42 which 
appears to account for most of the divergence.
The GBD study estimated that 2·9 million deaths 
in 2015 were associated with household air pollution, 
whereas WHO estimated 4·3 million related deaths 
in 2012. This difference can partly be explained by 
different approaches in quantifying exposure–outcome 
associations. The GBD study relied on the integrated 
exposure–response curve40 to provide evidence for the 
effect size of non-communicable diseases, whereas WHO 
adapted relative risks for certain non-communicable 
diseases based on epidemiological evidence. Additionally, 
the GBD study has expanded data sources for personal 
exposure values for women, men, and children in the 
past 2 years.
The GBD study estimated that, in 2015, 1·8 million 
deaths resulted from diseases related to water pollution, 
whereas WHO estimated 0·84 million related deaths 
in 2012. This divergence appears largely to reflect 
differing definitions of access to safe water. The GBD 
study considers access to safe water at both the water’s 
source and at the point of use, whereas WHO only 
considers access to an improved water source.
Diseases caused by all forms of pollution were responsible 
for an estimated 9 million deaths in 2015.41 Pollution is thus 
responsible for more deaths than a high-sodium diet 
(4·1 million), obesity (4·0 million), alcohol (2·3 million), 
road accidents (1·4 million), or child and maternal 
malnutrition (1·4 million). Pollution was also responsible 
for three times as many deaths as AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria combined (figure 5)41 and for nearly 15 times as 
many deaths as war and all forms of violence.41 Only dietary 
risk factors (all combined) (12·1 million) and hyper­
tension (10·7 million) caused more deaths than pollution; 
however, the Commission notes that approximately 
2·5% of deaths due to hypertension are attributable to lead. 
Pollution and non-communicable diseases
Non-communicable diseases account for most of the total 
burden of disease due to pollution—approximately 71%.41 
In 2015, all forms of pollution combined were responsible 
for 21% of all deaths from cardiovascular disease, 26% of 
deaths due to ischaemic heart disease, 23% of deaths due 
to stroke, 51% of deaths due to chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and 43% of deaths due to lung cancer 
(figure 6).42
The relative risks of all non-communicable diseases 
associated with pollution increase as exposure to 
pollution increases. An integrated exposure–response 
function has been developed to describe these 
associations, and the health effects of air pollution are 
quantitatively consistent with those of tobacco smoke 
when their relative risks are plotted against a common 
metric of exposure to airborne fine particulates.121
The sources and nature of pollution change as 
countries develop and industrialise (figure 7).10,42 An 
unsafe water source, unsafe sanitation, and household 
air pollution are considered to be forms of pollution 
linked to poverty and the early stages of industrial 
development. Airborne fine particulate pollution, 
tropospheric ozone pollution, occupational chemical 
pollution, and soil pollution by heavy metals and 
chemicals (including lead) are considered to be forms of 
pollution linked to industrial development.
Changes to the distribution of pollution-related 
diseases occur in response to the changes that 
accompany 
development.11 
Thus 
deaths 
from 
pneumonia and diarrhoeal diseases—the diseases 
associated with household air pollution, water pollution, 
and poor sanitation—are slowly declining worldwide, 
although they still kill millions of people, particularly 
children in poor countries. These declines reflect 
reductions in the forms of pollution associated with 
traditional lifestyles in low-income and middle-income 
countries, and the advent of new vaccines such as the 
pneumococcal vaccine and the rotavirus vaccine;59 new

Note that the totals for air pollution, water pollution, and all pollution are less 
than the arithmetic sum of the individual risk factors within each of these 
categories because these have overlapping contributions—eg, household air 
pollution also contributes to ambient air pollution and vice versa.

Panel 3: WHO’s programme on pollution and health
WHO has, for several decades, been a leader in conducting 
crucial evaluations of the health effects of pollution, and these 
assessments provide the scientific basis for pollution control 
policies in many countries. WHO is also a global leader in 
providing guidelines and in coordinating health-focused 
partnerships for pollution control.
WHO is now further expanding this work through the 
framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
WHO is the custodian agency that monitors progress towards 
six SDG targets; this monitoring includes tracking several 
targets measuring the environmental health-related burden of 
disease within SDG 3. The following are examples of this work:
Ambient air pollution
•	
WHO has periodically reviewed the international literature 
on air pollution and developed Global Air Quality 
Guidelines.117 These are the primary reference points for air 
pollution standards worldwide. The latest version was 
published in 2006,117 and a committee has been formed to 
create an updated version in 2018.
•	
WHO hosts one of the largest databases of ambient air 
pollution measurements in cities. Currently, the publicly 
available WHO Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution 
Database contains air quality measurements from 
3000 cities, representing 103 countries. In the past 2 years 
alone, the database has nearly doubled in size, with more 
cities now measuring air pollution concentrations and 
recognising the associated health effects than ever before. 
This database also provides inputs to the integrated models 
that use satellite remote-sensing and chemical transport 
models to estimate ambient air pollution exposure globally, 
including estimates for regions without any ground-level 
monitoring (eg, smaller cities and rural areas). The Global 
Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database also supports 
monitoring of urban air quality for SDG 11 indicator 11·6: 
“to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of 
cities, including by paying special attention to air quality 
and municipal and other waste management”.118
Household air pollution
•	
WHO has developed guidelines119 for indoor air quality 
regarding household fuel combustion, which clarified the 
enormous health risks of burning kerosene, coal, and wood 
in the home, and has provided emission standards for 
home energy equipment used in cooking, heating, and 
lighting. This work filled a gap in health guidance for 
household energy interventions and is increasingly 
being adopted by development partners investing in 
improving access to energy in the homes of the poor 
worldwide.
•	
WHO has developed several tools and training programmes 
to build the capacity and understanding of countries and 
actors working in different sectors to effectively address 
household energy as a health risk. WHO is currently 
developing a Clean Household Energy Solution Toolkit 
(CHEST) to provide the guidance and tools necessary for 
countries to implement the WHO Guidelines for Indoor Air 
Quality: Household Fuel Combustion.119
•	
Monitoring access to clean energy in the home is led by 
WHO in close cooperation with partners performing 
household surveys (UNICEF, USAID, and the World Bank). 
The associated indicator, 7·1·2—the “proportion of 
population with primary reliance on clean fuels and 
technology”—is part of the Global Tracking Framework of 
Sustainable Energy for All and is used to show progress 
towards SDG 7, which follows WHO guidelines criteria.
Climate, pollution, and health
•	
WHO, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, and UN 
Environment Programme have joined forces in the 
BreatheLife campaign to address the associated crises of air 
pollution and climate change. The campaign was announced 
in July, 2016, and launched at Habitat III in Quito, Ecuador.
Urban health
•	
WHO has established the Urban Health Initiative to reduce 
deaths and diseases associated with air and climate 
pollutants in cities, while enhancing health benefits from the 
policies and measures used to tackle climate pollution.
Water and sanitation
•	
WHO has produced authoritative guidelines and technical 
assistance on management of water quality, sanitation, and 
wastewater, and health for decades. Along with UNICEF, 
WHO is responsible for tracking the extent of human 
exposure to poor water, inadequate sanitation, and poor 
hygiene.
Toxic chemicals
•	
WHO is the leading international agency for chemical safety 
through its Intergovernmental Panel on Chemical Safety, 
which sets guidelines for dozens of commonly used 
chemicals. The importance of chemicals management is 
reflected by SDG target 3·9 on reducing deaths and illness 
from hazardous chemicals, and links to target 12·4 on the 
sound management of chemicals and wastes. Achievement 
of sound chemicals management requires a multisector, 
multistakeholder approach. To advance this work, the 2017 
World Health Assembly approved a Chemicals Road Map to 
enhance the engagement of the health sector in the 
management of international chemicals.

approaches to paediatric therapy such as oral rehydration 
therapy;60 and improved nutrition of young children and 
pregnant women.61
By contrast, the numbers of deaths caused by ambient 
air, chemical, and soil pollution—the forms of pollution 
associated 
with 
modern 
industrial 
and 
urban 
development—are increasing. The number of deaths 
attributable to PM2·5 air pollution is estimated to have 
risen from 3·5 million (95% CI 3·0 million–4·0 million) 
in 1990 to 4·2 million (3·7 million–4·8 million) in 2015, a 
20% increase. Among the world’s 10 most populous 
countries in 2015, the largest increases in numbers of 
pollution-related deaths were seen in India and 
Bangladesh, as reported by the Health Effects Institute. 
The increase in the absolute number of deaths and 
DALYs attributable to pollution reflects an increased 
population size, an ageing population, and increased 
levels of air pollution in low-income and middle-income 
countries.23
An analysis of future trends in mortality associated with 
ambient PM2·5 air pollution finds that, under a “business 
as usual scenario”, in which it is assumed that no new 
pollution controls will be put into place, the numbers of 
deaths due to pollution will rise over the next three 
decades, with sharpest increases in the cities of south and 
east Asia.35,121 These trends are projected to produce a more 
than 50% increase in mortality related to ambient air 
pollution, from 4·2 million deaths in 2015 to 6·6 million 
deaths in 2050 (95% CI 3·4 million–9·3 million).35,122 
These projections are corroborated by an analysis107 of the 
health effects of coal combustion in China. Population 
ageing are major contributors to these projections of 
growth and absolute increased numbers of deaths from 
pollution-related disease.
A second analysis123 examining the potential benefits of 
reducing PM2·5 pollution projects that aggressive controls 
could avoid 23% of current deaths related to air pollution. 
However, because of population ageing and consequent 
increases in age-related mortality from cardiovascular 
disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 
lung cancer, and also because the exposure–response 
association between PM2·5 pollution and non-com­
municable diseases is relatively strong at lower levels of 
exposure but weaker at higher levels, Apte and colleagues124 
note that it will be easier to achieve reductions in mortality 
(Panel 3 continued from previous page)
Mercury
•	
WHO is supporting implementation of the Minamata 
Convention on Mercury and has developed guidance for 
phasing out mercury-containing instruments in the health 
sector.120 Urgent attention by health departments and ministries 
is needed to address the phase out of import, export, and 
manufacture of mercury thermometers, sphygmomanometers, 
and other mercury-containing instruments in health care.
Cancer
•	 WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC) has the responsibility of determining whether 
chemicals are human carcinogens and conducts a range of 
research on cancer worldwide. IARC provides evidence-
based guidance on cancer control to countries around 
the world.

in less heavily polluted areas of western Europe and 
North America than in heavily polluted regions in Asia.
Geography of pollution
In 2015, the greatest numbers of deaths due to pollution 
occurred in southeast Asia (3·2 million deaths) and the 
western Pacific (2·2 million deaths; figure 8).42 In this 
definition, southeast Asia includes India and the western 
Pacific region includes China. The highest population-
based estimates of premature death and disease due to 
pollution are seen in the low-income countries of sub-
Saharan Africa.42
Pollution and poverty
92% of all pollution-related mortality is seen in low-
income and middle-income countries, with the greatest 
numbers of deaths from pollution-related disease 
occurring in rapidly developing and industrialising 
lower-middle-income countries (figure 9).42 In the most 
severely affected countries, pollution is responsible for 
more than one in four deaths.42 In countries at every level 
of income, the health effects of pollution are most 
frequent and severe among the poor and the 
marginalised. Further discussion of the links between 
pollution, disease, and poverty is presented in section 3 
of this report. 
Disease and death due to pollution occur most 
frequently in the very young and the very old. Deaths due 
to all forms of pollution show a peak among children 
younger than 5 years of age, but most pollution-related 
deaths occur among adults older than 60 years of age 
(figure 10).42 By contrast, DALYs resulting from pollution-
related disease are highly concentrated among infants 
and young children, reflecting the many years of life lost 
with each death and case of disabling disease of a child 
(figure 11).42
Air pollution
Two types of air pollution—household air pollution and 
ambient air pollution—and two airborne pollutants—fine 
particulates and ozone—are considered in this Comm­
ission.23 Pollution caused by oxides of nitrogen and by 
some short-lived climate pollutants is not fully accounted 
for in this Commission because the burden of disease due 
to these forms of air pollution is not separately quantified 
in the GBD study.
Although household and ambient air pollution are 
considered separately in deriving estimates of disease 
burden,42,99 they are both comprised of many of the same 
pollutants and often co-exist; for example, in low-
income and middle-income countries, household 
cooking 
contributes 
to 
ambient 
particulate 
air 
pollution.55,56 Accordingly, the total numbers of deaths 
attributed to air pollution in the GBD study and in the 
WHO estimates are less than the arithmetic sum of the 
number of deaths attributed to each form of 
pollution alone.35,99,125
Air pollution disperses globally. Airborne pollutants 
travel across national boundaries, continents, and 
oceans.126–128 An analysis129 of emissions from Chinese 
export manufacturers found that, on days with strong 
westerly winds (winds blowing from China across the 
Pacific), 12–24% of sulphate concentrations, 2–5% of 
ozone, 4–6% of carbon monoxide, and up to 11% of black 
carbon pollution detected in the western USA were of 
Chinese origin.

Air pollution and disease
PM2·5 is the best studied form of air pollution and is linked 
to a wide range of diseases in several organ systems.23,130 
The strongest causal associations are seen between PM2·5 
pollution and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. 
Specific causal associations have been established between 
PM2·5 pollution and myocardial infarction,131–137 hyper­
tension,138 congestive heart failure, arrhythmias,139 and 
cardiovascular mortality.24,140–143 Causal associations have 
also been established between PM2·5 pollution and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.42 The 
International Agency for Research on Cancer has reported 
that airborne particulate matter and ambient air pollution 
are proven group 1 human carcinogens.34,40,144
Fine particulate air pollution is associated with several 
risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including: 
hypertension,138 increased serum lipid concentrations,145 
accelerated progression of atherosclerosis,146–148 increased 
prevalence of cardiac arrhythmias,139 increased numbers of 
visits to emergency departments for cardiac conditions,132,133 
increased risk of acute myocardial infarction,131 and 
increased 
mortality 
from 
cardiovascular 
disease142 
and stroke.149
Clinical and experimental studies suggest that fine 
airborne particles increase risk of cardiovascular dis­
ease by inducing atherosclerosis, increasing oxidative 
stress, increasing insulin resistance, promoting endo­
thelial dysfunction, and enhancing propensity to coag­
ulation.145,147,148,150
Emerging evidence suggests that additional causal 
associations may exist between PM2·5 pollution and 
several highly prevalent non-communicable diseases. 
These include diabetes,25 decreased cognitive function, 
attention-deficit or hyperactivity disorder and autism in 
children,30,31,151,152 and neurodegenerative disease, including 
dementia, in adults.28,29,33 PM2·5 pollution may also be 
linked to increased occurrence of premature birth and 
low birthweight.27,153–159 Some studies have reported an 
association between ambient air pollution and increased 
risk of sudden infant death syndrome.160 These associ­
ations are not yet firmly established, and the burden of 
disease associated with them has not yet been quantified, 
and they are therefore included in zone 2 of the 
pollutome (figure 3).
Water pollution
This Commission considers two types of water pollution: 
unsafe water source and inadequate sanitation.51 Many 
areas in low-income and middle-income countries lack

acceptable water supplies and many people, particularly 
in rural areas in poor countries, have inadequate 
sanitation.52 Prevention technologies and systems exist, 
but poverty, lack of knowledge, and other priorities 
constrain the adoption of improvements.161
The problems of water supply and health are intensified 
where industrial pollutants contaminate water systems 
because treatments that control infectious agents are not 
effective in removing many toxic chemicals from 
drinking water. Improved analytical techniques have 
allowed identification of hundreds of industrial 
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides in water 
systems. Some of the worst biological and chemical 
pollution of drinking water is seen in rapidly urbanising 
and industrialising lower-middle-income countries, 
where local waterways and groundwater are heavily 
polluted and serious health conditions are widely 
reported, but no alternative water sources exist.53
The principal diseases linked to water pollution are 
acute and chronic gastrointestinal diseases, most 
importantly diarrhoeal diseases (70% of deaths attributed 
to water pollution), typhoid fever (8%), paratyphoid 
fever (20%), and lower respiratory tract infections (2%).42 
These estimates include diseases associated with an 
unsafe water source, inadequate sanitation, and in­
adequate hand-washing. Polluted water and inadequate 
sanitation are linked, additionally, to a range of parasitic 
infections. These diseases affect more than 1 billion 
people, predominantly in low-income and middle-
income countries.41
Water pollution also has effects on planetary health that 
extend beyond its effects on human health.15 Pollution of 
rivers, lakes, and the oceans from agriculture, manu­
facturing, and the extractive industries can have cat­
astrophic effects on freshwater and marine ecosystems 
that result in the collapse of fisheries and the diminished 
livelihood of indigenous populations and others who rely 
upon fish as a major food source.162,163
Most of the deaths caused by unsafe sanitation and 
unsafe water sources occur in children younger than 
5 years of age. Increased numbers of deaths from 
waterborne pollution-related disease are also seen in 
adults older than 60 years of age.
Burden of disease due to water pollution
The GBD study42 estimates that, in 2015, 1·8 million 
deaths were attributable to water pollution, including 
unsafe water sources, unsafe sanitation, and inadequate 
handwashing. Of this total, 0·8 million deaths were 
estimated to be caused by unsafe sanitation and 
1·3 million to unsafe water sources. The total burden of 
disease attributable to water pollution is less than the 
sum of the diseases attributable to each of its components 
because of overlaps between unsafe water source, unsafe 
sanitation, and inadequate handwashing. WHO data 
indicate that 0·28 million deaths were attributable to 
unsafe sanitation in 2012 and that unsafe water sources 
were responsible for 0·5 million deaths.99 As in the case 
of air pollution, the total number of deaths attributed to 
all forms of water pollution combined is less than the 
arithmetic sum of the deaths due to the individual types 
of water pollution because the various types of water 
pollution often co-exist and overlap with each other.
Trends in disease from water pollution
Targeted interventions to provide modern water and 
sanitation infrastructure began in the developing world 
as early as the 1950s, in the early days of international 
development assistance programmes. The Millennium

Development Goals (MDGs) accelerated this work, and 
MDG Target 7C called on the global community “by 2015, 
to halve the proportion of the population without 
sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic 
sanitation”. To track interventions against water pollution 
and waterborne disease, WHO and UNICEF established 
the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and 
Sanitation.54
Substantial progress has been made in reducing 
water pollution and waterborne disease. Between 1990 
and 2015, 2·6 billion people gained access to improved 
drinking water sources, 2·1 billion people gained access 
to improved sanitation, and the MDG Target 7C was 
met 5 years ahead of schedule. In this time, the number 
of children dying from diarrhoeal diseases decreased 
by almost 60%, from approximately 1·5 million deaths 
in 1990 to slightly greater than 0·6 million deaths in 2012. 
However, despite this progress, 2·4 billion people are 
still using unimproved sanitation facilities, including 
946 million people who still practise open defecation.
Geography of water pollution and disease
Population-based estimates of the number of deaths 
from water pollution are highest in sub-Saharan Africa 
(figure 12).42 Large numbers of deaths are seen also in 
some southeast Asian countries. In the past two decades, 
China has greatly reduced mortality from waterborne 
infectious disease.42
Importantly, these data do not reflect deaths from 
chemical pollution of water, because data for levels of 
chemical contamination of drinking water are not 
available for most low-income and middle-income 
countries. Disease due to chemical contamination of 
drinking water is included in zone 2 of the pollutome 
(figure 3).
Soil, heavy metal, and chemical pollution
Comprehensive assessments of the health effects of 
most forms of soil, heavy metal, and chemical pollution 
have not yet been published. Lead is an exception, and 
has been studied extensively. Newer research on a 
few contaminated sites is beginning to report data 
for disease burden at these sites; at present, these 
estimates are limited to DALYs and do not include 
deaths.
Lead
People have used lead for centuries but, until the modern 
era, it was largely an occupational poison.164 In the 
19th and 20th centuries, lead moved beyond the 
workplace into air, water, and soil in countries around the 
world as a consequence of sharp increases in lead 
production that accompanied the Industrial Revolution. 
In the early 20th century, lead was incorporated, for the 
first time, into mass-market consumer products such as 
lead-based paint and gasoline. Global contamination of 
air, water, and soil resulted. Global production of lead has 
more than doubled since the 1970s and continues to rise. 
Increasing global manufacture of batteries for products 
ranging from mobile phones to cars, is the main driver of 
this increase.165 82% of deaths due to lead occur in low-
income and middle-income countries.
In adults, chronic exposure to lead is an established 
risk factor for hypertension, renal failure, cardiovascular

disease, and stroke, especially among workers exposed in 
their occupations. Large-scale epidem­iological studies26 
based on a national probability sample have confirmed 
that the causal association between lead, hypertension, 
and mortality from cardio­vascular disease is evident even 
at very low blood lead concentrations.
Neurodevelopmental toxicity is the most important 
consequence of lead toxicity in children.166 The neuro­
behavioural sequelae of paediatric lead exposure include 
cognitive impairment,167–170 shortening of attention span 
with increased risk for attention deficit or hyperactivity 
disorder,171 and increased risk for antisocial and criminal 
behaviours.172,173 These effects can persist across the entire 
lifespan and result in decreased school performance, 
increased risk of drug abuse and in­carceration, and 
decreased economic productivity. Lead causes neuro­
behavioural damage in children at even the very lowest 
blood concentrations. WHO states that “there is no 
known level of lead exposure that is considered 
safe” (panel 4).30,32,37,88,91,173–177
Trends in lead exposure
Despite continuing increases in global lead production, 
bans on the use of lead in petrol, paint, plumbing, and 
solder have produced substantial reductions in lead 
exposure and disease burden. Lead has now been 
removed from gasoline in more than 175 countries.
Despite these advances, several sources of occupational 
and community exposure to lead persist.38,178,179 Lead-
glazed pottery is a notable source of exposure in several 
countries.169,180 Infants in the womb can be exposed to 
lead via transplacental transfer, and nursing infants can 
be exposed to lead in breastmilk.181 Children are at risk of 
exposure to lead-based paint in older housing182,183 and to 
lead that leaches into drinking water from lead pipes and 
solder.184 Informal (so-called “backyard”) recycling of 
used lead-acid batteries is a widespread source of lead 
exposure for both workers and communities.185
Estimates from the GBD study42 indicate that lead was 
responsible for 0·5 million premature deaths and for 
9·3 million DALYs in 2015. This estimate is based 
entirely on adult deaths (15 years and older). Half of 
these deaths occurred in people aged 70 years and older. 
These estimates do not reflect exposures to lead at 
contaminated sites.186 Although lead has caused child 
mortality in episodes of acute poisoning at heavily 
contaminated sites in low-income and middle-income 
countries,187 it is not a major contributor to child 
mortality globally.
Cardiovascular 
diseases, 
including 
hypertension, 
coronary artery disease, stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and 
peripheral arterial disease, account for the overwhelming 
majority of deaths attributable to lead in adults.26,188 These 
associations are evident at blood lead concentrations as 
low as 5 μg/dL.188,189 The GBD study42 estimates that lead 
exposure accounts for 2·5% of the global burden of 
ischaemic heart disease. Lead is also estimated to account 
for 12·4% of the global burden of idiopathic intellectual 
disability (panel 4). The GBD analysis indicates that 
deaths in 2015 that were attributable to lead are as follows: 
cardiovascular disease (465 000 deaths), ischaemic heart 
disease (240 000), cerebrovascular disease (155 000), 
ischaemic stroke (68 000), haemorrhagic stroke (87 000), 
hypertensive heart disease (47 000), and chronic kidney 
disease (28 000).42
WHO estimates that, in 2012, lead was responsible for 
13·9 million DALYs109 and that childhood lead exposure 
is responsible for mild to moderate mental retardation 
of 0·6 million children annually.190
Pollution at contaminated sites
Polluted soil at contaminated sites threatens the 
environment and human health in communities world­
wide. Most contaminated sites are relatively small, but 
the aggregate number of people affected globally by the 
many hundreds of thousands of extant sites is large.191 
Polluted sites are most commonly contaminated by 
informal, small-scale, unregulated local industry or 
artisanal activity.191–193 Sites can be contaminated by 
current industrial and mining activity, or they can 
be abandoned, legacy sites that were contaminated 
by previous operations.194
The contaminants at polluted sites that pose the greatest 
threats to health are environmentally persistent substances 
such as metals, persistent organic pollutants (including 
persistent pesticides), and radionuclides. The metals most 
commonly encountered at polluted sites include mercury, 
lead, chromium, and cadmium.
Panel 4: Pollution and neurodevelopment
Fetuses, infants, and children are particularly sensitive to neurotoxic pollutants, even at 
very low levels of exposure, because of the vulnerability of early-stage development of the 
human brain.91,174–176 Toxic exposure during so-called windows of vulnerability in early life 
can cause lasting damage to brain function. Lead poisoning in childhood has, for 
example, been linked to reduced cognitive function and also to juvenile delinquency, 
violent crime in adulthood, and lifelong reduction in economic productivity.37 Neurotoxic 
pollutants are also linked to autism,152 attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder,89,177 and 
conduct disorders.173
Exposure to neurotoxic pollutants is widespread as a result of fossil fuel combustion, 
industrial and agricultural production, and the extensive use of toxic chemicals in 
consumer products.30 Routine biomonitoring studies have detected many dozens of toxic 
pollutants in the bodies of children and pregnant women.175
Pollutants known to be toxic to the developing brain (in addition to lead) include 
mercury, combustion by-products such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fine 
particulate matter, organophosphate pesticides, brominated flame retardants, 
phthalates, and polychlorinated biphenyls.88 Many more commonly used chemicals, 
whose developmental neurotoxicity has not yet been discovered could be causing 
undetected damage to children today.
The social and economic costs of early life exposure to neurodevelopmental toxicants are 
great. Large economic and social gains can be realised through prevention of these 
disorders.32The Lancet Commissions
www.thelancet.com    Vol 391   February 3, 2018	
479
Human exposure to contaminated soil at toxic sites can 
result from ingestion, inhalation, or dermal absorption.195 
Ingestion is the most common pathway. Children are at 
greatest risk of exposure because they play close to the 
ground and because of their common oral exploratory 
behaviour.196–198
In high-income countries, substantial progress has 
been made in identifying and remediating contaminated 
industrial sites and, thus, in reducing exposures and 
associated disease. In the USA, the Superfund 
programme (panel 5),199 a national programme for site 
remediation, has been funded by the US Federal 
Government since 1980199,200 and additionally by state 
governments. In Europe, similar programmes have been 
created and, since 2004, they have been subsumed under 
the Environmental Liability Directive of the European 
Commission, which establishes a framework to prevent 
damage and remediate hazardous sites based on the 
polluter-pays principle.201
Burden of disease due to soil pollution by metals and chemicals 
at toxic sites
Based on data from the Blacksmith Institute/Pure Earth 
Toxic Sites Identification programme, we estimate that 
about 61 million people in the 49 countries surveyed to-
date are exposed to heavy metals and toxic chemicals at 
contaminated sites. Because this estimate reflects 
exposures at only a fraction of the total number of 
contaminated sites worldwide, further investigation will 
be required before the full magnitude of exposures at 
such sites and their contribution to the global burden of 
disease can be estimated.202
Two types of contaminated sites that have begun to be 
studied in detail are used lead-acid battery recycling sites 
and artisanal and small-scale gold mining sites 
(table 2).112,113,203 Lead poisoning from informal battery 
recycling is seen in low-income countries in all regions of 
the world.187,204–206 Artisanal and small-scale gold mining 
takes place worldwide, but is most highly concentrated in 
Africa.207 Details on methods for these analyses can be 
found in the appendix (pp 17–18).
We estimate that between 6 million and 16 million people 
are exposed to dangerous concentrations of lead each 
year at used lead-acid battery recycling sites.185,203 These 
exposures result in the loss of an estimated 0·87 million 
DALYs annually.203 We also estimate that between 14 million 
and 19 million artisanal and small-scale gold miners 
are at risk of occupational exposure to elemental mercury.112 
These exposures result in an estimated 2·9 million DALYs 
lost annually to elemental mercury poisoning.112
Occupational pollutants
Recognition of the health consequences of toxic 
occupational exposures dates to 200 BC,164 and many of the 
diseases caused by occupational exposures were well 
known by the 1700s.208,209 The major epidemics of industrial 
disease that ravaged workers’ health in the 19th and 
20th centuries are, however, of relatively recent origin. 
Such diseases include coal workers’ pneumoconiosis,210 
silicosis,164 bladder cancer in dye workers211 leukaemia and 
lymphoma in workers exposed to benzene,212 and 
asbestosis, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and other 
malignancies in workers exposed to asbestos.213 These 
conditions can be traced to the rapid, initially largely 
uncontrolled, industrialisation and reckless exploitation of 
natural resources that characterised the Industrial 
Revolution in western Europe, North America, Japan, 
and Australia.
Panel 5: Superfund legislation
Legislation to control contaminated waste sites was enacted in the USA in the aftermath 
of a series of environmental and public health disasters.199 The major trigger occurred at 
the Love Canal (Niagara County, NY, USA), an unused channel between Lake Erie and Lake 
Ontario into which the Hooker Chemical Company had dumped toxic wastes from 
the 1940s until the 1960s. When it was full, the canal was covered with a clay seal, and 
homes and a school were built on top of this clay. However, the waste did not stay 
underground. The canal filled with water and, by 1976, heavy rain regularly caused toxic 
sludge to bubble up into the basements of the overlying homes and into nearby streams. 
By the time this site was recognised as a hazardous waste site, Love Canal contained an 
estimated 21 000 tonnes of discarded chemicals. Within a few years, a second major 
waste site was discovered near Louisville, KY. Known as the Valley of the Drums, the site 
contained thousands of steel drums full of chemical wastes that had accumulated over 
several decades.
These events made it clear to policy makers and the public that hazardous waste was an 
environmental and public health emergency. In response, the US Congress passed the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act on 
Dec 11, 1980. The law became known as the Superfund Act because it authorised the 
creation of a large fund that, from 1980 to 1995 was supported by a tax on the chemical 
manufacturing and petroleum industries, the two major producers of toxic chemical 
wastes. Many of the new hazardous waste sites subsequently being discovered were the 
result of actions by polluters who no longer existed. The tax was based on the polluter-
pays principle and was intended to provide resources to remediate abandoned sites. In 
1995, the US Congress allowed the tax on the chemical and petroleum industries to 
expire. Since that time, remediation of hazardous waste sites in the USA has been 
supported through general tax revenues.

In high-income countries, the worst occupational 
exposures have now been controlled by legislation and 
regulation, backed by strong enforcement, and rates of 
occupational disease are down.164,214 Substantial progress 
has been made in controlling exposures to occupational 
carcinogens. Central to this success has been the work of 
WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer, 
which has produced independent and objective analyses 
of the carcinogenicity of hundreds of chemicals. These 
analyses guide cancer control programmes in countries 
around the world
By contrast, occupational exposures to toxic pollutants 
have become highly prevalent in the past 50 years in low-
income and middle-income countries.42 The worst of 
these exposures tend to occur in informal, small-scale, 
locally owned establishments where child labour is also a 
frequent problem.176
Burden of disease due to toxic occupational pollutants
Occupational pollutants cause a wide range of 
diseases.164,215–217 The GBD study42 considers the burden of 
disease attributable to two types of occupational 
pollutants. 
These 
are 
occupational 
carcinogens—
asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, silica, 
sulphuric acid, trichloroethylene, arsenic, benzene, 
beryllium, cadmium, chromium, diesel exhaust, second-
hand smoke, formaldehyde, and nickel—and occupational 
particulates, gases, and fumes.
The GBD study42 estimates that, in 2015, toxic 
occupational risk factors (not including occupational 
injuries or ergonomic factors) were responsible for 
0·88 million deaths globally and for 18·6 million DALYs. 
Carcinogens were responsible for 0·49 million (55%) of the 
deaths from occupational exposures to toxicants and for 
9·8 million DALYs. Asbestos was responsible for 
nearly 40% (0·18 million) of all deaths caused by 
occupational carcinogens. Exposures to particulates, gases, 
and fumes in the workplace were responsible for an 
estimated 0·36 million deaths and for 8·8 million DALYs.
WHO data indicate that, in 2012, occupational 
pollutants were responsible for 0·36 million deaths.110 
Occupational respiratory carcinogens (arsenic, asbestos, 
beryllium, cadmium, chromium, diesel exhaust, nickel, 
silica) were responsible for 0·1 million of these deaths; 
occupational leukaemogens (benzene, ethylene oxide, 
ionising radiation) for 3000 deaths; occupational 
particulates, dusts, fumes, and gases for 0·23 million 
deaths; 
and 
acute 
occupational 
poisonings 
for 
27 000 deaths. WHO estimates that, in 2012, occupational 
exposures were responsible for 13·6 million DALYs.109
Age distribution of deaths linked to toxic occupational 
pollutants
Most deaths attributable to occupational pollutants and, 
especially, to occupational carcinogens occur in people 
aged 50 years and older (figure 13).42 This pattern reflects 
the long latency of most occupational cancers.213
Pollution sources not currently quantified
Many hundreds of new synthetic chemicals have entered 
world markets in recent decades, come into widespread 
use, and are now beginning to be recognised as potential 
threats to health. These chemicals have become 
extensively disseminated in the environment, are 
detectable in the bodies of almost all people examined in 
national surveys, and have the potential to cause global 
epidemics of disease, disability, and death. Most 
chemicals have undergone little or no assessment of their 
safety or potential hazards to human health.
Because the effects of these new chemicals on human 
health are only beginning to be recognised and their 
contributions to the global burden of disease are not yet 
quantified, they are currently placed within zone 3 of the 
pollutome (figure 3). Such emerging chemical pollutants 
are described below.
Developmental neurotoxicants
Evidence is strong that widely used chemicals and 
pesticides have been responsible for injury to the brains of 
millions of children and have resulted in a global pandemic 
of neurodevelopmental toxicity.37,88 The manifestations of 
exposure to these chemicals during early development 
include loss of cognition, shortening of attention span, 
impairment of executive function, behavioural disorders, 
increased prevalence of attention deficit and hyperactivity 
disorder, learning disabilities, dyslexia, and autism.37
Prospective epidemiological birth cohort studies have 
been a powerful instrument for detecting associ­
ations between prenatal exposures to developmental 
neurotoxicants and disease.218 Examples of pollution-
related diseases in children that have been identified 
through prospective studies are: cognitive impairment, 
with decreased IQ in children exposed prenatally to

An important unanswered question is whether there 
are additional chemicals in use today whose ability to 
cause silent injury to the developing human brain has 
not yet been discovered.88,222,223
Endocrine disruptors
Endocrine disruptors are chemical pollutants that mimic, 
block, or alter the actions of normal hormones.78,90–92 They 
include phthalates, bisphenol A, perchlorate, several 
pesticides, such as the orthophosphates, brominated 
flame retardants, and dioxins. Many endocrine disruptors 
are also developmental neurotoxicants. These chemicals 
are manufactured in volumes of millions of kilograms 
per year and are used widely in consumer products such 
as soaps, shampoos, perfumes, plastics, and food 
containers. Exposures in utero to even extremely low 
doses of endocrine-disrupting chemicals during early 
development can lead to permanent impairments in 
organ function and increased risk of disease. Prenatal 
exposures have been linked to autistic behaviours in 
children224 and to anomalies of the reproductive organs 
in baby boys.225
Pesticides
More than 20 000 commercial pesticide products, 
including insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and 
rodenticides are available on world markets. More than 
1·1 billion pounds of these products are used in the USA 
each year and an estimated 5·2 billion pounds globally.226 
Some of the heaviest applications occur in low-income 
and middle-income countries where use and exposure 
data are scant. Experience with three categories of 
pesticides—the 
organophosphate 
insecticides, 
the 
neonicotinoid insecticides, and the synthetic herbicide 
glyphosate—illustrate the challenges posed by these new 
and inadequately tested pesticide chemicals.
The organophosphate insecticides are a large and 
widely used class of pesticides. Members of this class of 
chemicals are powerful developmental neurotoxicants, 
and prenatal exposures are associated with persistent 
deleterious effects on children’s cognitive and be­havioural 
function and with long-term, potentially irreversible, 
changes to brain structure that are evident on MRI.220 
Toxicological studies of rodents exposed perinatally to 
organophosphates produce parallel findings.227
The neonicotinoids are a novel class of neurotoxic 
pesticides that were developed in the 1980s and whose 
use has risen substantially in the past decade. The 
neonicotinoid imidacloprid is now the most widely used 
insecticide in the world.228 In the USA, agricultural use of 
neonicotinoids was nearly 4 million kg in 2014.229
Neonicotinoids target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors 
in the insect nervous system.230 They are water-soluble and 
can persist for years in soils, dust, wetlands, and 
groundwater and are detected in commonly consumed 
foods. Substantial evidence indicates that neonicotinoids 
can have negative effects on the behaviour and health of 
bees and other pollinators at environmentally relevant 
concen­trations.231,232 These chemicals are a suspected cause 
of bee colony collapse disorder. Despite their extensive use 
and known neurotoxicity to insects, very little information 
is available on the possible human health effects of the 
neonicotinoids.228
Chemical herbicides account for nearly 40% of global 
pesticide use and applications are increasing.226 A major 
use is in production of genetically modified food crops 
engineered to be resistant to glyphosate (Roundup), the 
world’s most widely used herbicide. Glyphosate-resistant, 
so-called “Roundup Ready” crops, now account for more 
than 90% of all corn and soybeans planted in the USA, and 
their use is growing globally. Glyphosate is widely detected 
in air and water in agricultural areas, and glyphosate 
residues are detected in commonly consumed foods.
Epidemiological studies of agricultural workers who 
were exposed occupationally to glyphosate and other 
herbicides have found evidence for increased occurrence of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma in these people. Toxicological 
studies of experimental animals exposed to glyphosate 
show strong evidence of dose-related carcinogenicity at 
several anatomical sites, including renal tubule carcinoma 
and haemangiosarcoma. On the basis of these findings, 
the International Agency for Research on Cancer has 
determined that glyphosate is a “probable human 
carcinogen”;233 this finding is contested by glyphosate’s 
manufacturer.
Thousands of tonnes of pharmaceutical waste are 
released into the environment each year, especially in 
high-income and middle-income countries, and measur­
able concentrations of several pharmaceuticals are detected 
in urban wastewater.95,96
The sources of pharmaceutical waste pollution include 
discharges from pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, 
hospitals, agriculture, and aquaculture. Anti-inflam­matory 
agents, antibiotics, oestrogens, anti-epileptics, caffeine, 
and cancer chemotherapy agents are among the 
compounds most commonly detected. In some locations, 
concentrations of the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac 
have been reported to exceed predicted no-effect levels.234,235 
Concern is increasing that these compounds could damage 
freshwater and salt water marine species through a range 
of 
toxicological 
mechanisms, 
including 
endocrine 
disruption.The Lancet Commissions

pollutants is presented in the appendix (pp 2–11).
Research recommendations
To increase knowledge of pollution and its effects in 
human health, this Commission recommends that 
research be undertaken to: (1) define and quantify the 
burden of neurodevelopmental disease in children and 
the burden of neurodegenerative disease in adults 
attributable to PM2·5 air pollution (zone 2 of the 
pollutome); (2) define and quantify the burden of 
diabetes attributable to PM2·5 air pollution (zone 2 of the 
pollutome); (3) define and quantify the burden of pre-
term birth and low birth weight attributable to PM2·5 air 
pollution (zone 2 of the pollutome); (4) better quantify 
the burden of disease caused by chemical pollutants of 
known toxicity at contaminated sites, such as lead, 
mercury, chromium, arsenic, asbestos, and benzene 
(zone 2 of the pollutome); and (5) discover and quantify 
health effects associated with new and emerging 
chemical pollutants, such as developmental neuro­
toxicants, endocrine disruptors, novel classes of 
insecticides, chemical herbicides, and pharmaceutical 
wastes (zone 3 of the pollutome).
Section 2: The economic costs of pollution and 
pollution-related disease
Premature death and disease due to pollution impose 
great costs on national budgets and health-care 
spend­ing, especially in rapidly industrialising low-income 
and middle-income countries. Diseases caused and 
exacerbated by pollution result in medical expenditures 
and in pain and suffering. Pollution-related disease can 
reduce labour force participation, labour market product­
ivity, and economic output. In children, pollution-related 
disease can cause failure in school and perpetuate 
intergenerational poverty. Early life exposures to neuro­
toxic pollutants such as lead and mercury can impair 
cognition, diminish the ability to concentrate, and disrupt 
behaviour, thus reducing lifetime earnings. The costs of 
disease and premature death caused by pollution, 
especially the more modern forms of pollution, are 
rising rapidly.236
The costs of pollution-related disease are often 
overlooked and undercounted because they are associated 
with non-communicable diseases of long latency that 
extend over many years, are spread across large 
populations, and are not captured by standard economic 
indicators.7–9,237 These costs are much more difficult to 
calculate than the costs of pollution control, which are 
usually tangible and concrete.238 Although the costs of 
pollution-related disease can have large effects on the 
budgets of health ministries and increase spending in 
health systems, they are typically buried in general health 
expenditures and hospital budgets, hidden in productivity 
reports, do not affect the budgets of environment 
ministries, and are not attributed to pollution.9
The costs of pollution-related disease include: (1) direct 
medical expenditures, including hospital, physician, and 
medication costs, long-term rehabilitation or home care, 
and non-clinical services such as management, support 
services, and health insurance costs; (2) indirect health-
related expenditures, such as time lost from school or 
work, costs of special education, and the cost of 
investments in the health system (including health 
infrastructure, research and development, and medical 
training); (3) diminished economic productivity in 
persons whose brains, lungs, and other organ systems 
are permanently damaged by pollution; and (4) losses in 
output resulting from premature death.
Pollution-related disease is responsible also for 
intangible costs, such as those of poor health in people 
made ill by pollution, disruption of family stability when 
a person of working age becomes disabled or dies 
prematurely as a result of pollution, and the loss in years 
of life to the person themselves.
A method to estimate the tangible costs of pollution-
related disease was developed in the early 1980s by an 
expert committee convened by the Institute of 
Medicine.239 The core of this method is calculation of the 
so-called “fractional contribution” of pollution to 
causation of a particular disease.41 This environmentally 
attributable fraction is defined as ‘‘the percentage of a 
particular disease category that would be eliminated if 
pollution was reduced to the lowest feasible levels.’’240 
This fractional contribution is then multiplied by the 
number of cases of pollution-related disease in a 
population and by the average cost per case to calculate 
the total costs of pollution-related disease.
The cost of a case of illness is often measured by the 
medical expenses incurred when a person is ill (the direct 
costs of illness) and by the loss in productivity when a 
person dies prematurely or is disabled (the indirect cost 
of illness).241 This method has been used to estimate the 
costs of pollution-related disease in children242–244 and of 
occupational 
disease 
in 
workers,245 
has 
enabled 
quantification of the effects of pollution-related disease 
on GDP, and has provided a means to calculate costs that 
are typically externalised and not captured by standard 
accounting methods, and thus were previously hidden.7 
Information derived from this so-called full-cost 
accounting method has proven to be a powerful lever for 
shaping public policy and is an effective antidote to one-
sided arguments for not taking or delaying action against 
pollution that are based solely on the costs of 
pollution control.7,9
The cost of illness approach to calculating costs of 
pollution-related disease works reasonably well in 
countries with strong public health data systems and 
robust information about the costs of disease. However, 
it is less applicable in countries without those resources. 
Therefore, the GBD study and WHO estimates of the 
burden of disease due to pollution are based primarily 
on data for premature deaths and do not adequatelyThe Lancet Commissions
www.thelancet.com    Vol 391   February 3, 2018	
483
reflect the full burden of pollution-related disease 
because, in many countries, researchers are not able to 
capture information about pollution-related morbidity. 
In countries where data are available relating pollution 
to morbidity and to the costs of disease, these costs are 
often substantial. Such studies suggest that the 
morbidity costs resulting from pollution-related dis­
ease might conservatively increase mortality costs 
by 10–70%,236,246,247 and some individual country studies 
suggest that the increment might be even greater: 
25% for Colombia,247 22–78% for China,248 and 78% for 
Nicaragua.249
A second shortcoming in using the cost of illness 
approach to estimate the health costs of pollution is that 
it can never capture the intangible losses caused by 
pollution-related disease, even when comprehensive data 
are available. For example, this method can neither 
measure the family disruption that follows the premature 
death of a mother or a father nor can it quantify the grief 
that follows the death of a child. Those losses are separate 
and qualitatively different from losses in income 
generated or in goods produced.14 Similarly, a method 
that is based solely on the effect of pollution on GDP 
cannot fully describe the negative effects of pollution on 
societal health, on diminished visibility in national parks, 
on ecosystem services, or the benefits of pollution control 
in enhancing national welfare.72
To overcome these shortcomings in the cost of illness 
approach, economists have devised a second strategy to 
assess disease costs: the so-called “willingness-to-pay” 
method. This metric is a measure of how much people 
are willing to pay to reduce the risk of premature 
death.250–252 This approach captures individuals’ pre­
ferences for avoiding increases in risk of death by 
analysing their behaviour in risky situations (the revealed 
preference approach) or in hypothetical choice situations 
involving changes in their risk of death (the stated 
preference approach).
To aggregate data from willingness to pay (WTP) 
studies, economists have developed the Value of a 
Statistical Life (VSL) concept. The VSL is defined as the 
total of what many people would pay for small reductions 
in the probability of dying over the coming year that, 
together, add up to saving one life. For example, if each of 
10 000 people were willing to pay US$100 over the coming 
year to reduce their risk of dying by 1 in 10 000, 
one statistical life would be saved and the VSL would 
equal $100 × 10 000, or $1 000 000.
Multiplying the number of lives lost to pollution by the 
VSL provides an estimate of the health costs associated 
with pollution. Multiplying the number of lives that 
pollution control would save by the VSL provides an 
estimate of the benefits of pollution control.
Although the VSL method has the disadvantage of 
relying on estimates of what people say they will pay to 
reduce mortality risks, it overcomes many of the 
limitations that hinder efforts to estimate pollution-related 
disease costs; for instance, by expanding estimates from 
those made solely in terms of productivity losses and 
effects on GDP. The VSL method has been used by 
governments in high-income countries and in Colombia, 
Malaysia, Mexico, and Peru, amongst others, to estimate 
the benefits of reducing pollution.246
Methods
This Commission uses both approaches in the current 
analysis. Economic losses from pollution-related disease 
are therefore measured in terms of lost productivity and 
health-care costs, and the costs of pollution-related 
disease are also presented using estimates derived from 
WTP studies. Costs associated with air, water, and lead 
pollution are included in this analysis, but costs 
associated with soil pollution are not yet available and are 
not included. To calculate the VSL in countries where no 
original studies are available, we have extrapolated 
estimates from other countries, taking differences in 
income levels into account.246,253 This method is described 
in the appendix (pp 25–28).
The economic benefits that result from the control of 
pollution and prevention of pollution-related disease are 
the same as the costs that result from pollution-related 
disease. Losses in economic productivity are a key 
component of the costs of pollution-related disease. When 
pollution-related disease results in the death of children or 
adults of working age, the economic output that those 
people would have produced is lost forever. The productivity 
losses associated with premature mortality are measured 
by calculating the output that an individual would have 
produced over his or her working life, summing these 
losses to the present.
Pollution-related disease also reduces the productivity 
of ill people while they are working. Hanna and Oliva254 
estimated that the closing of a heavily polluting refinery in 
Mexico City, Mexico, increased the hours worked by 
people living near the refinery by 3·5%. Zivin and 
Neidell255 found that a 10 ppb reduction in ground-level 
ozone increased the productivity of farm workers in 
California, USA, by 5·5%. Chang and colleagues256 report 
that each 10 µg/m³ increase in outdoor PM2·5 
concentrations reduced the productivity of factory workers 
by 6% in northern California, USA. Similarly, water 
pollution has also been shown to reduce adult productivity. 
An estimated 35 million people in Bangladesh are 
exposed to concentrations of arsenic in groundwater that 
exceed 50 µg/L and 57 million people are exposed to 
concentrations above the WHO standard of 10 µg/L. 
Carson and colleagues,257 who performed this study, 
estimate that reducing arsenic concentrations to the 
WHO standard would increase annual hours worked by 
the average household in their sample by 6·5%.
A method to measure lost output is to calculate its effects 
on a worker’s contribution to GDP. Table 3 shows 
reductions in GDP that result from pollution-related 
deaths as a percentage of a country’s GDP. Losses areThe Lancet Commissions

reported by World Bank income group and pollutant 
category (lead exposure, ambient air pollution, household 
air pollution, unsafe water, and unsafe sanitation. Because 
the magnitude of productivity losses is sensitive to the 
interest rate used to discount losses to the present (discount 
rate), this Commission gives results using two different 
discount rates (1·5% and 3%). For country-level data see 
appendix (pp 43–47).
Because pollution-related disease is most common in 
heavily polluted, low-income countries, productivity 
losses due to pollution-related disease are dis­pro­
portionately high in these countries. Thus, in low-income 
countries, product­ivity losses due to pollution-related 
disease represent between 1·3% and 1·9% of GDP. By 
contrast, in lower middle-income countries, these 
losses amount to between 0·6% and 0·8% of GDP. In 
low-income countries, the largest productivity losses 
due to pollution-related disease result from lack of 
access to safe water and sanitation, followed by exposures 
to air pollution. Household air pollution alone causes 
losses of between 0·49% and 0·68% of GDP in 
low-income countries.
In upper middle-income and high-income countries, 
most economic losses attributable to pollution-related 
disease are due to ambient air pollution. These losses 
comprise a smaller fraction of GDP than in low-income 
and lower middle-income countries because there is 
generally less pollution in these countries and prevalence 
of pollution-related disease is lower. An additional factor 
that reduces the estimated costs of pollution-related 
disease in high-income countries is that more than 82% of 
deaths due to air pollution in these countries occur in 
people age 65 years and older. This reduces the calculated 
costs because the international definition of working age 
is 15–64 years of age and, hence, the economic contribution 
of premature death in people older than 65 years is not 
counted. In upper middle-income and high-income 
countries, estimated economic losses due to pollution-
related disease in 2015 were more than US$53 billion. 
Additional economic costs of coal combustion not 
included in this analysis are costs related to disease and 
premature death in coal miners due to injuries and coal 
workers’ pneumoconiosis; costs of lung cancer in coke 
oven workers; ecological and community costs of 
mountain top removal and strip mining; losses in property 
values near mines and along railroad rights-of-way; loss 
of timber resources; and crop losses due to water 
contamination.9
Pollution benefit-cost analyses
Benefit-cost analyses of water and sanitation improvements 
and improved cookstoves must account for the health 
benefits of these interventions, the time savings for 
households who no longer need to collect water or 
firewood, and the benefits associated with improved 
childhood health, such as greater educational achievement.
The health benefits associated with a project to improve 
water quality (eg, home disinfection of drinking water) 
exceed the reduced mortality risk and lost productivity 
measured in this chapter, and also include reductions in 
morbidity due to diarrhoea, especially among children, 
and associated reductions in malnutrition.
Two studies that combine results from the medical 
literature to estimate the global benefits of various water 
and sanitation interventions suggest benefit-cost ratios 
greater than 1 for many interventions on the basis of health 
benefits and time savings. The average benefit-cost ratio 
for deep borehole wells with hand pumps is 4·64, whereas 
household water treatment with bio-sand filters yields an

average benefit-cost ratio of 2·48.258,259 A cost–benefit 
analysis finds that improved water supplies, according to 
the WHO definition, yield a return of US$2 for every 
dollar invested.
Despite general acceptance that well targeted water and 
sanitation interventions have positive benefit-cost ratios,260,261 
the scale of these benefits can be questioned, given the 
number of uncertainties that are usually involved.262,263 Site-
specific analysis and examination of the range of probable 
benefit-cost ratios can provide useful input to the process of 
making policy and project decisions.264
Neurotoxic pollutants can reduce productivity by 
impairing children’s cognitive development. It is well 
documented that exposures to lead and other metals 
(eg, mercury and arsenic) reduce cognitive function, as 
measured by loss of IQ.168 Loss of cognitive function 
directly affects success at school and labour force 
participation and indirectly affects lifetime earnings. In 
the USA, millions of children were exposed to excessive 
concentrations of lead as the result of the widespread use 
of leaded gasoline from the 1920s until about 1980. At 
peak use in the 1970s, annual consumption of tetraethyl 
lead in gasoline was nearly 100 000 tonnes.
It has been estimated that the resulting epidemic of 
subclinical lead poisoning could have reduced the 
number of children with truly superior intelligence 
(IQ scores higher than 130 points) by more than 50% 
and, concurrently, caused a more than 50% increase in 
the number of children with IQ scores less than 70 
(figure 14).265 Children with reduced cognitive function 
due to lead did poorly in school, required special 
education and other remedial programmes, and could 
not contribute fully to society when they became adults.
Grosse and colleagues46 found that each IQ point lost to 
neurotoxic pollution results in a decrease in mean 
lifetime earnings of 1·76%. Salkever and colleagues266 
who extended this analysis to include the effects of IQ on 
schooling, found that a decrease in IQ of one percentage 
point lowers mean lifetime earnings by 2·38%. Studies 
from the 2000s using data from the USA267,268 support 
earlier findings but suggest a detrimental effect on 
earnings of 1·1% per IQ point.269 The link between lead 
exposure and reduced IQ46,168 suggests that, in the USA, a 
1 µg/dL increase in blood lead concentration decreases 
mean lifetime earnings by about 0·5%. A 2015 study in 
Chile270 that followed up children who were exposed to 
lead at contaminated sites suggests much greater effects. 
A 2016 analysis by Muennig271 argues that the economic 
losses that result from early-life exposure to lead include 
not only the costs resulting from cognitive impairment 
but also costs that result from the subsequent increased 
use of the social welfare services by these lead-exposed 
children, and their increased likelihood of incarceration.
Pollution-related disease has substantial effects on 
health-care expenditure. To quantify these costs, it is 
necessary to know the number of cases of each category 
of pollution-related disease in a population and the 
average health-care expenditure per case (appendix 
pp 29–31). These data are available for some high-income 
countries272 but not for low-income and middle-income 
countries, except for Sri Lanka.273
Respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and 
cancer account for the largest proportion of the DALYs 
from 
pollution-related 
disease. 
Air 
pollution 
is 
responsible for half of the DALYs associated with lower 
respiratory tract infections and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease worldwide, and for a quarter of the 
DALYs resulting from ischaemic heart disease and 
stroke.42,106 Globally, 24% of the DALYs associated with 
cancers of the trachea, bronchus, and lungs are attributed 
to air pollution. The proportions of DALYs linked to each 
of these non-communicable diseases are higher in 
low-income and middle-income countries than in 
high-income countries (table 4).41,42 For country-level 
calculations see the appendix (pp 57–62).
Based on information from seven high-income 
countries, it can be estimated that air pollution, which 
accounts for 2·4% of all DALYs in these countries 
(panel 6),42 accounts for 3·5% of their total health 
expenditure; in 2013, this amounted to US$100 billion. In 
Sri Lanka, a rapidly industrialising lower middle-income 
country where the burden of pollution-related disease is 
proportionately much larger than in high-income 
countries, air pollution accounts for 6·5% of all DALYs. 
Estimated expenditures on disease due to air pollution in 
Sri Lanka account for 7·4% of all health-care expenditures.

Globally, unsafe water and sanitation, including poor 
hand hygiene, are associated with 96% of DALYs due to 
diarrhoeal disease and with 95% of the DALYs linked to 
typhoid fever. In low-income countries, these percentages 
are even higher (97% for both diseases). Health-care 
expenditures on pollution-induced diarrhoea and typhoid 
are difficult to quantify due to inadequate data. However, 
the costs of treating these diseases, especially for 
children, represent only a small proportion of the health 
costs to society from these diseases274,275 and the 
impoverishing effect of these diseases can be as great, if 
not greater, than the direct cost of illness. For example, in 
children who survive diarrhoea, effects on nutritional 
status and school attendance are likely to far outweigh 
the costs of treatment. Repeated bouts of diarrhoea 
interfere with the body’s ability to absorb nutrients and, 
in countries where many children are malnourished, 
compound the effects of poor nutrition.276 The negative 
effects of poor nutrition on labour force productivity277 
and the effects of diarrhoea and other childhood diseases 
on school attendance are well studied.278 All of these 
effects are magnified in settings where poor households 
forego medical treatment but still suffer substantial 
impoverishment from the loss of household income or 
long-term disability, where the foregone treatment is a 
low-cost intervention that could have restored full labour 
market participation.
We define welfare losses from pollution-related disease 
as equal to household WTP to reduce pollution. When the 
VSL method is used to estimate the global costs of 
premature deaths attributable to pollution, the total 
in 2015 was more than US$4·6 trillion, or 6·2% of world 
GDP (table 5).42
This estimate of WTP to reduce pollution greatly exceeds 
the estimated costs of pollution-related disease that are 
derived from productivity losses alone for two reasons. 
Firstly, what people will pay to reduce their risk of death is 
much greater than the present value of lost output. When a 
person dies at age 35 years, the present value of productivity 
losses is about 20 times per capita GDP; in low-income 
countries, the ratio of the VSL to per capita GDP is 
between 40:1 and 50:1. Secondly, the VSL is applied to all 
premature deaths, not only those of adults at working age. 
Because 75% of deaths associated with lead pollution, 
64% of deaths associated with ambient air pollution, 33% of 
deaths associated with unsafe water and sanitation, 
and 56% of the deaths associated with household air 
pollution occur at age 65 years or older, these deaths are 
excluded from economic calculations based on producti­vity 
losses. The VSL approach values these deaths by what 
people are willing to pay to avoid them. By contrast, the 
method based on productivity losses presented in table 3 
assigns no value to deaths that occur at age 65 years or older.
Although pollution damages are highest, in absolute 
terms, in high-income countries, they are highest as a 
proportion of income in low and middle-income 
countries. Table 5 shows the damages associated with 
each pollutant category, measured in 2015 US dollars at 
market exchange rates and as a percent of gross 
national income (which represents the sum of incomes 
earned by all residents of a country), and summarised 
by World Bank income category. The method used to 
calculate these damages is identical to that used in the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation-World Bank 
study;279 however, this Commission presents all figures 
converted to 2015 US dollars at market exchange rates 
rather than using purchasing power parity dollars. 
Because the ability to pay to reduce mortality risks 
increases with income, it is highest for high-income 
countries. The value of avoided mortality as a percent of 
income is, how­ever, much higher as a proportion of 
income for low-income and middle-income countries—
between 8·3% and 9·4% of gross national income, 
reflecting the fact that most pollution deaths occur in 
these countries.
Ambient and household air pollution together 
constitute the largest category of welfare damages for all 
groups of countries. In high-income and upper middle-
income countries, the damages associated with ambient 
air pollution outweigh the damages associated with 
household air pollution—ie, eliminating all deaths due 
to ambient air pollution would yield higher benefits than 
eliminating all deaths due to household air pollution. 
The reverse is true in lower middle-income and low-
income countries. The damages from unsafe water and 
sanitation remain substantial, constituting 39% of 
damages in low-income and 27% of damages in lower 
middle-income countries.
Panel 6: Summary of Commission’s estimates of the health 
costs of pollution-related disease
•	
In high-income countries, health-care spending on diseases 
caused by air pollution alone amounted to 3·5% of total 
health expenditures in 2013.
•	
In Sri Lanka, the only low-income or middle-income 
country for which data are available, health-care spending 
on diseases due to air pollution accounted for an 
estimated 7·4% of health-care spending in 2013.
•	
The costs of lost productivity from pollution-related 
disease are estimated to be between 1·3% and 1·9% of 
gross domestic product (GDP) in low-income countries, 
and between 0·6% and 0·8% of GDP in low-middle 
income countries.
•	
In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, the 
cost of lost productivity associated with pollution-related 
disease is estimated to have exceeded US$53 billion 
in 2015. 
•	
When the willingness-to-pay method is used to estimate 
the amount that people would be willing to pay to avoid 
premature death due to pollution-related disease, the 
total is estimated to be more than US$4·6 trillion, which 
is 6·2% of global economic output.The Lancet Commissions
www.thelancet.com    Vol 391   February 3, 2018	
487
The welfare losses presented in table 5 (for country-
level calculations, see appendix pp 48–52) can also be 
used to estimate WTP for policies to control pollution. 
Table 6 shows estimates of the amount a person 
exposed to pollution would be willing to pay to reduce 
the risk of death from exposure to each pollutant source 
to zero, converted to 2015 US dollars at market exchange 
rates.42 For country-level WTP calculations, see the 
appendix (pp 53–56). This WTP estimate is the product 
of the VSL and the mortality risk associated with the 
pollutant, which is also shown. The WTP values 
indicate what a person would be willing to pay to reduce 
their risk of death due to pollution, assuming that they 
understood the risk. Some of these numbers might 
appear low—for example, the WTP per person for an 
improved water source in low income countries is 
US$15 per person; however, this would almost be 
sufficient to cover the capital costs of installing a 
borehole well (approximately $20 per person).280 
Moreover, measures to control pollution yield benefits 
beyond 
reductions 
in 
mortality 
risk, 
such 
as 
convenience and comfort, in addition to health benefits. 
Reducing outdoor air pollution and smoke from 
burning solid fuels provides aesthetic and ecosystems 
benefits, and the health benefits of clean air.
Although high, these numbers almost certainly 
underestimate the full economic burden of pollution-
related disease because of inadequate data in many 
countries on pollution and disease prevalence, poor 
knowledge of the toxic effects of many chemicals in 
widespread use,36,37 and lack of information on the 
possible effects later in life of toxic exposures sustained 
in early life. An issue that contributes to this 
underestimate is that calculations of productivity losses 
due to pollution understate the total value of output lost 
due to premature mortality because deaths of persons 
over age 64 are not counted in these calculations. It 
should also be noted that the economic approach for 
calculating productivity effects reflects only losses in 
output that are captured in GDP, and thus does not 
capture productivity losses in domestic work (child care, 
cleaning, and cooking) or in the informal sector.281 Finally, 
GDP does not measure societal wellbeing.14,282
The estimates presented here also do not capture the 
health savings that have been projected to result from 
the reductions in air pollution that will arise from 
strategies to slow the pace of global climate change.2 The 
evidence for health benefits of climate mitigation was 
reviewed in the Lancet Commission on Health and 
Climate Change.97 The annual marginal benefits of 
avoided mortality from reductions in air pollution that 
will result from greenhouse gas mitigation strategies are 
estimated to range from US$50–380 per ton of CO2 
abated, and are projected to exceed marginal abatement 
costs in both 2030 and 2050. 
Research recommendations
We make several recommendations related to research on 
the economic costs of pollution. Research is needed to 
improve estimates of the morbidity costs of pollution. This 
requires measuring the morbidity associated with 
pollution, which is more difficult than estimating mortality. 
This improvement also requires valuing morbidity 
endpoints, which are more diverse than mortality.
Additionally, work is needed to improve estimates of 
the non-health benefits of reducing pollution. For 
traditional pollution problems, these estimates should 
include the value of time savings associated with water 
and sanitation interventions and improved cookstoves 
and the education benefits associated with reduced 
illness in children. For ambient air pollution, estimates 
should include the aesthetic value and the ecosystem 
benefits of cleaner air.
Section 3: Pollution-related disease, poverty, 
and the SDGs
The former Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi 
Annan, has declared that “the biggest enemy of health in 
the developing world is poverty.”283 Pollution, poverty, 
poor health, and social injustice are deeply intertwined. 
Pollution and pollution-related disease most affect the 
world’s poor and powerless.284 Pollution’s victims are 
often the vulnerable and the voiceless. To understand the 
links between pollution, poverty, and pollution-related 
disease, it is necessary to elucidate the complex and 
multidimensional nature of poverty.285 Poverty is not 
simply a lack of money. Poverty results also in reduced 
access to education, health care, nutrition, and sanitation 
and impedes participation in legal and political processes, 
when such processes exist, and in civil society. When

families lack access to food, clothing, and shelter, they do 
not have the resources to support even a minimum level 
of health.
This Section of the Commission report presents data 
documenting that pollution and pollution-related disease 
are concentrated among the poor and contribute to the 
intergenerational perpetuation of poverty. Pollution-
related disease can result in lost income and increased 
health-care costs, thus imposing disproportionately great 
economic burdens on poor families and communities.286 
In children, early-life exposure to neurotoxic pollutants 
can impair cognitive function and diminish the ability to 
concentrate, further contributing to school failure and 
reducing lifetime earnings. In example, a long-term 
follow-up study144 of children exposed to lead reported 
that an elevated blood lead concentration at age 11 years 
was associated with lower cognitive function and reduced 
socioeconomic status at age 38 years, with diminished 
IQ, and downward social mobility. Moreover, poverty can 
worsen health, for example, by forcing people to live in 
environments that make them ill, without decent shelter, 
clean water, or adequate sanitation.287 When people live 
near polluting factories or downstream from hazardous 
waste sites, or when poor women have no alternative but 
to cook with traditional stoves in close quarters, or when 
children are forced to pick by hand through electronic 
waste to recover precious metals to sustain themselves 
and their families,288 poverty can exacerbate poor health.
Without political influence and with little power in 
most countries to control or prevent pollution, the poor 
have limited ability to determine the fate of their 
communities. Their dependence for survival on tight 
social networks further restricts their mobility and 
opportunities. The result of these interconnected forces 
is that poverty is a trap that often spans generations. The 
poor have disproportionately heavy exposures to 
pollution and disproportionately high amounts of 
disease, disability, and premature death.289,290 A major 
challenge to enlightened heads of government is to 
balance economic development that lifts people and 
communities out of poverty against pollution control and 
the prevention of pollution-related disease.
Pollution threatens fundamental human rights: the 
rights to life, to health, and to wellbeing.291 It jeopardises 
the rights of the child, the right to safe work, and the 
protection of the most vulnerable.292 Pollution and 
pollution-related disease are often reflections of 
environmental injustice. Many countries recognise the 
right to a healthy environment as a basic human right 
linked to the right to life and other fundamental human 
rights.293,294 The right to a healthy environment also 
includes the right to safe food and water and adequate 
housing.293,294
Recognition of the right to a healthy environment 
requires that all members of a society have unfettered 
access to information about sources and patterns of 
pollution; that they have the power to participate in 
environmental planning and decision making; and that 
there is an environmental regulatory agency and an 
independent judiciary that protect the environment from 
polluters, and the poor against pollution.295
Pollution and pollution-related disease are often 
reflections of environmental injustice. Robert Bullard, 
widely regarded as the father of the environmental justice 
movement,296 defines a core principle of environmental 
justice as “all people and communities are entitled to 
equal protection of environmental and public health laws 
and regulations.”297 Bullard stresses that environmental 
justice is a far-reaching concept that involves much more 
than equal enforcement of laws and regulations. In 
Bullard’s view, environmental justice is a basic human 
and civil right and requires meaningful and timely 
involvement of people and communities in decisions 
that affect their environment and wellbeing. In 1991 
Bullard and his colleagues, at the first National People of 
Color Environmental Leadership Summit adopted 
17 Principles of Environmental Justice.298 These principles 
were developed as a guide for organising, networking, 
and relating to government and non-government 
organisations.
Environmental injustice is the inequitable exposure of 
poor, minority, and disenfranchised populations to toxic 
chemicals, 
contaminated 
air 
and 
water, 
unsafe 
workplaces and other forms of pollution, and the 
consequent disproportionate burden among these 
populations of pollution-related disease, often in violation 
of their human rights. Environmental injustice has been 
characterised as a form of structural violence.299 In many 
instances, environmental injustice is linked to so-called 
“structural racism”.300

Global spread of extractive industries: oil and gas 
production, mining, and smelting
Social and economic factors that have contributed to the 
global spread of environmental injustice and the in­
equitable exposure of poor and marginalised populations 
to pollution and disease include globalisation, which has 
caused the movement of hazardous industries such as 
chemical manufacture, steel making, pesticide production, 
and shipbreaking from higher income countries to low-
income and middle-income countries. This movement has 
entailed low wages, little or no environmental and 
occupational regulation, and weak public health infra­
structure. The consequences of these occupational and 
environmental conditions are disease and injury in 
underprotected workers, diseases caused by toxic 
chemicals in residents of communities near polluting 
facilities, and industrial explosions. Examples include the 
chemical explosion in Bhopal, India where a pesticide 
production factory that had been trans-shipped from 
the USA detonated and killed and injured thousands or 
workers and local residents; the global trade in asbestos 
that results in shipment of 2 million tons of asbestos 
annually to the world’s poorest countries, where it will 
produce epidemics of lung cancer, mesothelioma, and 
other malignancies;214 and the global trade in banned and 
restricted pesticides.
Transboundary transfers of hazardous and toxic 
wastes, such as electronic wastes and chemical wastes, 
from high-income to low-income and middle-income 
countries are a further cause of the global spread of 
environmental injustice. The global spread of artisanal 
and small-scale gold mining and the concomitant spread 
of occupational and community-wide exposure to 
elemental mercury and methylmercury are another 
example.112,113 The expansion of gold mining is driven by 
large increases in the global price of gold, which 
encourage poor people to leave agriculture and other 
traditional occupations. Although small-scale mining is 
relatively profitable for the miners, it is highly 
exploitative in that the majority of the profits accrue with 
brokers and retailers, and the burdens of disease and 
environmental degradation fall almost entirely upon 
mining communities. Regional conflicts and wars, 
frequently driven by a desire for natural resources 
(namely oil, minerals, and timber) further aggravate 
these problems.
Environmental injustice exists in countries at all levels 
of income and development and in all regions of the 
world,284,301–303 as can be seen in the following examples 
and case studies.
Combating environmental injustice
To advance environmental justice and reduce the 
inequitable exposure of the poor and the marginalised, 
countries must develop legal mechanisms that provide 
recourse for environmental injustice. India’s green 
court, for example, provides citizens with access to an 
independent judiciary that has the power to redress 
pollution injustices. Such a system, when connected with 
openly shared data on toxic exposures and health can 
serve as a powerful mechanism to address environmental 
injustice (panel 7).
Environmental injustice in North America is well 
documented. Recurrent racial and ethnic disparities have 
been documented in North America in exposures to 
various forms of pollution. A study of the ambient air 
pollution in New York City have documented that almost 
all diesel bus depots, places where buses idle their 
engines for hours while emitting pollutants, are in 
minority, mostly disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Dis­
proportionately increased pre­valence of asthma and 
other respiratory diseases have been documented among 
children in these com­munities.304 In the so-called “Cancer 
Alley” region of Louisiana, an 85 mile stretch along the 
Mississippi River where 125 companies manufacture a 
quarter of all petrochemical products made in North 
America, the US Commission on Civil Rights determined 
that the African-American community was economically 
disadvantaged 
and 
disproportionately 
affected 
by 
pollution from hazardous facilities.305 Another case 
study306 of environmental injustice in the USA relates to 
the exploitative uranium mining operations on Native 
American (Navajo) lands. Mining operations there 
depleted and contaminated the scarce water supply and 
produced high prevalence of lung cancer in Navajo 
underground miners, who suffered intense occupational 
exposures to radon.306 A final example involves the 
disproportionate exposures of Hispanic farm workers to 
acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides, such as 
parathion. Several cases of acute pesticide poisoning have 
resulted. Many of these workers are undocumented 
immigrants and, hence, afraid to protest environmental 
injustice and pollution.307
Panel 7: India’s judicial system for pollution
During the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, India committed to 
providing judicial and administrative remedies for the victims of environmental damage. 
To fulfil this commitment, India became the third country in the world to start a National 
Green Tribunal, a judicial body exclusively established to judge environmental cases. 
The National Green Tribunal was formed on Oct 18, 2010. The focus of this body is on the 
effective and expeditious resolution of cases relating to environmental protection and 
conservation of forests and other natural resources. The National Green Tribunal is 
mandated to make final judgments on applications and appeals within 6 months of their 
filing. The National Green Tribunal is comprised of judges, who are supported by 
environmental experts to provide informed guidance on environmental issues, to validate 
the Tribunal’s legal judgments.
Cases such as the Vedanta Bauxite Smelter in Orissa, the Thermal Power Plants in Andhra 
Pradesh, and the Jaitpur Nuclear Power Plant in Maharashtra have seen controversy and 
protests. The involvement of the National Green Tribunal has resulted in amicable solutions 
to these cases, ensuring the people of the affected regions a safe and liveable environment. 
Before establishment of the National Green Tribunal there were numerous cases in which 
large industries were confronted by local people fighting for the environment.The Lancet Commissions

In Canada, environmental injustice occurs in the 
traditional lands of First Nations (indigenous peoples). 
First Nations are battling the Alberta Oil Sands Project in 
northern Alberta308 and exposure to Canada’s worst air 
pollution hotspot in Ontario’s so-called “Chemical Valley”, 
where 40% of the country’s chemical manufacturing is 
located.309
Environmental injustice issues are also prevalent in 
Europe.310 In central and eastern Europe, some minority 
Roma people and refugee and displaced communities 
from Kosovo have faced environmental injustice. In 
Kosovo, camps for displaced Roma were located in an area 
polluted by toxic tailings from a lead mine. In Durres, 
Albania, refugees from Kosovo were housed in a disused 
chemical plant that had previously produced sodium 
dichromate and lindane, compounds classified by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer as class 1 
(proven) human carcinogens.311
In Asia, the sustained economic growth that has enabled 
substantial reduction in poverty has simultaneously 
increased toxic pollution and environmental inequity.312 In 
China, a highly publicised example involved a paraxylene 
chemical factory in the city of Dalian, where residents 
feared that typhoons could breach chemical storage tanks 
and flood lower socioeconomic areas of the city with toxic 
material.313
In India, a well studied example of environmental 
injustice is the disproportionate siting of mineral and 
metals extraction facilities in the Adivasi belt of central 
and northeast India where 70 million Adivasis—tribal 
people—live in extreme poverty and are disproportionately 
exposed to air, water, and soil pollution produced by these 
facilities.313 In a landmark case linking the mining industry 
in the Adivasi belt to environmental injustice,314 the Indian 
Supreme Court observed that the fundamental rights of 
citizens, guaranteed by the Constitution, included “the 
right of enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full 
enjoyment of life”.
In Africa, extraction of natural resources is a major 
driver of environmental injustice and pollution. In 
Zambia, the lead and zinc mines at Kabwe are among the 
world’s most polluted places. Although these mines are 
no longer active, the residue left behind after decades of 
extraction 
by 
overseas-based 
companies 
have 
contaminated soil and the local water supply. Children in 
Kabwe have blood lead concentrations that are 5–10 times 
higher than the threshold concentration recommended 
by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.315 
Mineral extraction has also been associated with 
environmental injustice in post-apartheid South Africa, 
where large-scale gold mining has resulted in epidemic 
silicosis among miners, many of them economic 
migrants from the poor countries of southern Africa 
surrounding South Africa.313 Gold mining was also the 
cause of the 2010 tragedy in Zamfara State, Nigeria, in 
which 163 people in deeply impoverished communities, 
including 111 children, died of acute lead poisoning.316 
Similar events have been recorded in relation to gold 
mining in Ghana.
In Latin America, environmental inequality is evident in 
a series of clashes between extractive industries, 
particularly the mining industry but also oil and gas 
production, and indigenous communities. Examples 
include the Tia Maria copper project in Peru, operated by 
Mexico’s Southern Copper Corporation, the world’s second 
largest copper mining company, and the USA-based 
Newmont Mining Company’s US$4·8 billion Conga gold-
copper project, Peru’s biggest mining investment. Protests 
against the inequitable placement of these enormous 
projects on lands belonging to native peoples and the 
resulting 
disproportionate 
burdens 
of 
pollution, 
environmental degradation, and disease are reshaping 
basic paradigms of resource-based develop­ment. These 
struggles have forced contemporary legal systems, 
including legal systems in the high-income home countries 
of mining conglomerates, to accommodate indigenous 
world views and to correct, rather than perpetuate the 
unjust effects of economic growth upon the poor.313,317
With the worldwide spread of toxic chemicals and 
modern-day pollution, interest has grown in investigating, 
documenting, and mapping environmental injustice. 
Information produced through these efforts, especially 
information documenting patterns of pollution at the local 
level, can provide powerful leverage to disproportionately 
exposed communities who are struggling to reduce their 
exposure and their inequitable burden of pollution-
related disease.
 In Europe, the Environmental Justice Atlas, a global 
online database, now lists information on about 2000 sites 
around the world where pollution and environmental 
injustice are documented or suspected. Linked to 
this database is Environmental Justice, Organisations, 
Liabilities and Trade, a global research project supported 
by the European Commission that is compiling The Map 
of Environmental Justice, an atlas of maps documenting 
the distribution of pollution and environmental injustice 
around the world.318
Pure Earth, a New York-based environmental non-profit 
organisation has developed a Toxic Sites Inventory 
Program that includes information on about 3500 polluted 
sites—active and abandoned mines, smelters, factories, 
and hazardous waste dumps—a number that is still 
growing.38 This database focuses on contaminated sites in 
low-income and middle-income countries and has served 
as a resource to the work of this Commission.
In the USA, the Environmental Protection Agency has 
developed an open-access mapping tool, EJSCREEN, that 
is available on the EPA website and makes data on 
environmental injustice publicly available. This tool 
overlays 12 environmental factors, including information 
on levels of airborne particulate matter, lead paint, and 
proximity to water discharges with six demographic 
factors, including income level and percentage of the 
population classified as minority. The resulting maps

enable people to check their neighbourhoods and to 
directly examine the intersection of pollution with poverty.
The global distribution of pollution and pollution-
related disease illustrates the connections between 
pollution, poverty, and environmental injustice. 92% of 
pollution-related deaths occur in low-income and middle-
income countries (figure 8). In countries at every level of 
income, the health effects of pollution are most frequent 
and severe among the poor and the marginalised. By far, 
the largest share of pollution-related diseases is the 
outcome of urban and household air pollution. However, 
water pollution and toxic occupational exposures are also 
crucial contributors to mortality and morbidity.
Air pollution, poverty, and environmental injustice
In 2015, more than 99% of deaths due to household air 
pollution and approximately 89% of deaths due to 
ambient air pollution occurred in low-income and 
middle-income countries.319,320 Several cities in India and 
China record average annual concentrations of PM2·5 
pollution of greater than 100 μg/m³, and more 
than 50% of global deaths due to ambient air pollution 
in 2015 occurred in India and China.
Ambient air pollution in rapidly expanding mega-cities 
such as New Delhi and Beijing attracts the greatest public 
attention; however, WHO documents that the problem of 
ambient air pollution is widespread in low-income and 
middle-income countries and finds that 98% of urban 
areas in developing countries with populations of more 
than 100 000 people fail to meet the WHO global air quality 
guideline for PM2·5 pollution of 10 μg/m³ of ambient air 
annually.
Household air pollution offers an even starker example 
of the strong links between pollution and poverty.57 
Deaths due to household air pollution are highly 
concentrated in the world’s poorest countries.57 An 
estimated 3 billion people in low-income and middle-
income countries, mostly in rural communities, use 
solid fuels (firewood, biomass, or charcoal) and 
traditional stoves for heating and cooking.57 In sub-
Saharan Africa, for example, firewood is the main source 
of fuel, as it is in many parts of south Asia. The use of 
biomass fuels is closely linked to gender inequality. 
Without access to the cleaner fuels and cookstoves 
available to many urban households, rural women in 
these regions and their children are disproportionately 
exposed to toxic fumes from smoky open fires. As they 
cook food for the family or study by the light of the stove, 
these women and children court sickness and premature 
death in a way their urban counterparts do not.
Water pollution, poverty, and environmental injustice
Poor water and inadequate sanitation and hygiene are 
also highly concentrated in the world’s poorest countries. 
An estimated 2·5 billion people lack access to a basic 
toilet; 1 billion people defecate in the open; and 
748 million people lack clean drinking water.321 Poor 
people living in rural areas, indigenous peoples, people 
with disabilities, and other marginalised groups are 
especially likely to lack these basic services.
A sharp gender gap is evident in the health and social 
effects of water pollution and inadequate sanitation. 
Girls are particularly severely affected by inadequate 
access to safe water because the task of collecting water 
falls disproportionately on them and because lack of 
water introduces a problem with menstrual hygiene. The 
many hours that girls in poor communities must spend 
fetching water increase the risk that they will miss school 
and, thus, remain trapped in their communities by lack 
of education. If a school does not provide safe, private 
toilets, monthly periods can also force girls to miss class 
or to leave school altogether.322
Of all deaths due to toxic occupational exposures, 
92% occur in low-income and middle-income countries. 
This distribution reflects the fact that high-income 
countries have largely solved their worst problems of 
occupational exposure and reflects the international 
migration of polluting industries from high-income 
countries to poor countries.323,324
As a consequence of globalisation and production 
outsourcing, pollution and pollution-related disease have 
become planetary problems.325,326 Dumping hazardous 
materials produced in high-income countries in poorer 
countries is a clear intersection between global pollution 
and environmental injustice. This dumping includes 
shipment of pesticides, industrial waste, and toxic 
chemicals that are no longer permitted in North America 
or the European Union to poor countries. For example, 
in 2006, 500 tons of toxic waste were transported from 
Amsterdam in the vessel Probo Koala and dumped in 
sites around Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire. The toxic gas 
produced by the release of these chemicals resulted in 
17 deaths and in more than 100 000 cases of respiratory 
and gastrointestinal disease.327,328 A second example has 
been documented at a large electronic waste site at 
Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana.329 This site contains 
thousands of broken computers and other electronic 
components shipped from European countries in 
containers labelled “secondhand goods”; the European 
Union allows export of genuinely reusable electronic 
goods, but the material shipped to Agbobloshie is usually 
broken beyond repair and hardly reusable.326 Electronic 
waste dumpsites in poor neighbourhoods can be found 
worldwide, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. It is 
estimated that the global electronic waste market will 
quadruple in the next decade, from US$9·8 billion 
in 2012 to $41·4 billion in 2019.330
International action to address the global problem of 
dumping led to development of the 1989 Basel 
Convention on the Transboundary Movement of 
Hazardous Wastes and to conventions on persistent 
organic pollutants,80 pesticides, mercury, hazardous 
waste, and chemicals. The European Union also joined 
the cause and has issued directives to limit international

dumping that include restrictions on hazardous 
substances and on waste electrical and electronic 
equipment, both promulgated in 2002. Although these 
conventions and directives are limited by weak 
enforcement and by structural impediments, such as the 
requirement in the Rotterdam Convention for complete 
unanimity amongst all participating countries before a 
pollutant can be proscribed, they have, nonetheless, 
helped to slow the global movement of toxic substances 
and reduce toxic pollution.
Pollution, poverty, and the UN’s SDGs
The SDGs were adopted by the United Nations in 
September 2015 to guide the international development 
agenda until 2030. The SDGs are intended to advance 
human dignity in countries around the world.331 It is of 
note that the predecessor to the SDGs, the Millennium 
Development Goals that guided global action until 2015, 
made no mention of pollution at all. By contrast, SDGs 
focus on the issue to an extraordinary extent, as noted in 
the introduction, and as befits an issue so integral to the 
fight against poverty. The main provision is, appropriately, 
in SDG 3 on good health and wellbeing, where SDG 3·9 
commits the world community, by 2030, to “substantially 
reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from 
hazardous chemicals and air, water, and soil pollution 
and contamination”.332 The other pollution-specific goal is 
SDG 6 on water and sanitation, in which SDG 6·3 calls, 
by 2030, to “improve water quality by reducing pollution, 
eliminating dumping and minimizing release of 
hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the 
proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially 
increasing recycling and safe reuse globally”.
However, the SDGs do not leave the issue there. Given 
the close linkages between poverty and exposure to toxic 
pollution and the need to reduce, if not eliminate, both, 
the SDGs seem to recognise that some actions to achieve 
the broader goals, such as SDG 1 (end poverty) and 
SDG 2 (end hunger), could, if unchecked, result in 
exacerbation of pollution exposures. Hence, pollution 
control must be central to agricultural and industrial 
development, if development of these is to be truly 
sustainable. To this end, the SDGs make repeated 
references to preventing and reducing pollution. These 
include SDG 2.4 (improving soil quality), SDG 7 (clean 
energy), SDG 9.4 (clean technologies and industrial 
processes), SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 
SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), and 
SDGs 14–15 (water and land conservation). Achievement 
of these SDGs will also positively affect environmental 
justice and fulfil SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). 
Importantly, measures to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions and short-lived climate pollutants, such as 
black carbon, will help achieve SDG 13 (climate action).
The SDGs are explicitly about sustainable development 
but, for development to be sustainable, it must both 
combat poverty and ensure equity. In 1987, the Report 
of the World Commission on Environment and 
Development on “our common future” stated that 
sustainable development must assure the poor that they 
receive a fair share of the resources required to sustain 
their economic growth.333 With the growing recognition 
that pollution not only exacerbates poverty but leads to 
environmental injustice, sustainability of development 
is now also increasingly linked to equity. As observed in 
the Human development report 2011 by the United 
Nations Development Programme,334 sustainability and 
equity might not always be mutually reinforcing 
(although they can sometimes be), and the most feasible 
alternative solutions might require explicit and careful 
consideration of the trade-offs involved. Such an 
approach to pollution control will not only yield positive 
synergies between sustainability and equity but also 
ensure that the SDGs regarding poverty, pollution, and 
environmental justice are comprehensively met.
The Regional Action Plan for Intergovernmental 
Cooperation on Air Pollution for Latin America and the 
Caribbean, prepared by UN Environment Programme in 
the context of the Latin America and the Caribbean 
Forum of Ministers of Environment is an example of a 
high-level plan that sets out common directions for 
national governments to work together on broad 
issues.335 This Action Plan promotes collaboration 
towards the creation and adoption of national and local 
policies and programmes to reduce emissions of key 
pollutants and to achieve improvements in urban air 
quality in the region. The Action Plan covers broad 
supportive activities such as technical assistance, policy 
cooperation, methods, research, and awareness raising 
and monitoring. The Regional Action Plan will support 
and encourage the national and local administrations to 
develop and implement practical local plans to reduce 
the effects of air pollution.
Research recommendations
To reduce the inequitable exposure of the poor and the 
marginalised to pollution, this Commission recommends 
two key strategies. First, we recommend funding of 
research to document and map the disproportionate 
effects of pollution upon the poor, women, and girls be 
adopted as a priority by international health agencies. 
Additionally, a special focus should be placed on overseas 
development assistance to protect indigenous peoples and 
their communities from pollution and its harmful effects.
Section 4: Effective interventions against 
pollution: priorities, solutions, and benefits
A key message of this Commission report is that, with 
leadership, resources, and a clearly articulated, data-driven 
strategy, much of the world’s pollution can be controlled 
and pollution-related disease prevented. Strategies to curb 
pollution have been developed, field-tested, and proven 
cost-effective. These strategies were developed initially 
in high-income countries and are now moving into 
For the Rotterdam convention

493
middle-income countries. They are based on law and 
regulation, rely heavily upon technology, are subjected to 
continuous evaluation, are backed by strong enforcement, 
and incorporate the polluter-pays principle. These 
programmes are held accountable to targets and 
timetables. These successful, effective strategies for 
pollution control can be used as models and adapted to 
local circumstances in cities and countries at every level of 
income. Their application can enable developing cities and 
countries to leapfrog over the worst of the human and 
ecological 
disasters 
that 
have 
plagued 
economic 
development in the past.
A second key message is that control and prevention of 
pollution provide several benefits, both short-term and 
long-term, for societies at every level of income. The direct 
benefits of pollution mitigation include improvements in 
air and water quality and improvements in health. The 
health benefits include reductions in disease incidence 
and prevalence, improvements in children’s health, 
reductions in the numbers of premature deaths, increasing 
longevity, and substantial enhancements in quality of life. 
Indirect benefits include enhancing gender equity, 
alleviating 
poverty, 
increasing 
tourism, 
improving 
education, and enhancing political stability. Pollution 
control makes cities more liveable and attractive, benefits 
ecosystems, improves the economy and, when coupled 
with efforts to transition to clean fuels and to control 
emissions of greenhouse gases, pollution control can help 
to slow the pace of global climate change and accelerate 
the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable, circular 
economy.81,336,337
These many benefits of pollution control underscore the 
reality that pollution is much more than merely an 
environmental challenge; pollution is a profound and 
pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health 
and wellbeing.
Pollution control today builds on the successes of the 
past. The industrially developed countries were the first 
to control pollution, and many of their control strategies 
were adopted in the aftermath of environmental and 
public health disasters caused by pollution. Thus, in 
mid-19th century London, UK, putrid contamination of 
the River Thames and recurrent epidemics of cholera 
led to regulation of public drinking water sources338 and 
to the construction of large conduits for the removal of 
human waste and industrial pollution that now form the 
Thames Embankment.339 Episodes of severe air pollution 
with substantial loss of life, such as the Great Fog 
of London in 1952,340 and the Donora, Pennsylvania 
episode in the USA led to the passage of clean 
air legislation. Occupational and mining disasters 
catalysed the development of worker health and safety 
legislation. The discovery of contaminated toxic sites in 
the USA at Love Canal in New York and the Valley of the 
Drums in Kentucky led to legislation mandating 
clean-up of hazardous waste sites—the Superfund 
legislation.175 An epidemic of congenital methylmercury 
poisoning in Minamata, Japan341 led to global action to 
protect human health and the environment against 
mercury and culminated in adoption of the Minamata 
Convention.198
In response to the rapid, poorly controlled growth of 
cities and the global spread of industrial production and 
chemically intensive agriculture, low-income and middle-
income countries have become increasingly engaged in 
pollution control. Targeted interventions to control water 
pollution, improve sanitation, and reduce waterborne 
diseases were among the earliest efforts to control 
pollution in low-income and middle-income countries, 
and began as early as the 1950s. Bangladesh has long been 
in the forefront of this work,342,343 China has made 
extraordinary progress in control of water pollution and 
prevention of waterborne infectious disease (panel 8),344–354 
Panel 8: China’s recent experience
In its 13th Five-Year Plan, for 2016, the Government of China acknowledged the dangers 
posed by pollution344 and set specific targets for environmental improvement and 
restriction of resource use.
Air pollution
•	
China adopted The Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law in 1987. This law and its 
subsequent revisions have resulted in an 10% national decline in particulate matter 
less than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) between 2014 and 2016, despite extremely high particulate 
concentrations in certain cities such as Beijing.345 A 2016 amendment to the law 
explicitly mentioned, for the first time, the connection between environmental 
protection and public health.346
•	
China has increased its reliance on non-fossil energy sources (predominantly 
renewables and nuclear) from 9·4% of total energy use in 2010 to 12·0% in 2015, 
surpassing the 12th Five-Year Plan target of 11·4% by 2015. The most recent Five-Year 
Plan347 aims to increase non-fossil energy use to at least 15% by 2020, and to at 
least 20% by 2030.
•	
China has implemented a vast network of stations to monitor air quality in more than 
400 cities. The capacity to track emissions has been central to developing policy and 
implementing data-driven regulatory frameworks.348
Water pollution
•	
China’s most recent water pollution legislation, the Water Ten Plan, was adopted in 
April, 2015.349 This plan sets metrics and targets for ten major polluting industries. 
Among key targets to be met by 2020 are: more than 70% of water in seven key rivers 
shall reach Grade III or above; more than 93% of urban drinking water sources shall 
reach Grade III or above; reduce groundwater extraction and control groundwater 
pollution; and use of groundwater falling under the “very bad” category shall decrease 
to around 15%.
•	
The Ministry of Environmental Protection estimates that the Water Ten Plan will boost 
GDP by ¥5·7 trillion (US$91 billion), with a ¥1·9 trillion benefit to the affected 
industries.350
Soil pollution
•	
The 13th Five-Year Plan calls for the establishment of laws to monitor, prevent, and 
remediate soil pollution. The goal is to make 90% of polluted arable land safe for 
agricultural use by 2020, increasing to 95% by 2030.351 The Ministry of Environmental 
Protection estimates that the actions of the 13th Five-Year Plan could add ¥2·7 trillion 
($411 billion) to the nation’s GDP and create around 2 million jobs.352
•	
The Five-Year Plan also details a nationwide soil quality monitoring programme.353,354

and Peru has embarked on a programme to improve mine 
drainage.355
Air pollution control programmes are developing in 
cities in several low-income and middle-income 
countries, including Mexico City,356 Ulaanbaatar,357 and 
New Delhi.358 China is embarking on a national effort to 
reduce air pollution that includes a plan to dramatically 
increase reliance on non-polluting, renewable energy 
sources, and is on track to nearly triple its solar capacity 
between 2015 and 2020, adding 15 to 20 GW of solar 
capacity per year.123,359–361
Most countries now have programmes in place to 
address some aspects of pollution, and almost all have 
established frameworks for regulatory control of industry, 
although staffing, resources, and enforcement capacity 
are variable.362 This Section of the Commission report 
enumerates the benefits of pollution control, describes 
key elements of successful pollution control strategies 
and the responsibilities of stakeholders, and it concludes 
with recommendations.
The benefits of pollution control
Examples of pollution control and its benefits are 
presented in this section, panels 9 and 10,119,131,363–367 and in 
the appendix (pp 63–107).
One benefit afforded by pollution control is reduction 
of household air pollution by providing liquefied 
petroleum gas and bio-gas and by providing affordable 
electricity that is produced by non-polluting, renewable 
energy sources to replace wood chips, coal, charcoal, and 
cow dung as cooking fuels. These interventions not only 
reduce exposures to airborne particulates, thereby 
improving health, but they also produce short-term and 
long-term economic returns to local communities 
because households (especially women) are able to spend 
less time collecting wood, or processing dung for 
cooking, and thus have more time to devote to 
economically productive activities (for women) or 
education (for girls).368
A second benefit is improvements in sanitation that 
are achieved by providing clean water and toilets. These 
interventions not only reduce prevalence of waterborne 
disease but they also allow more children, especially 
girls, to attend school.369 These improvements benefit 
tourism and help lift the economy in developing 
countries, since a reputation for clean beaches, an 
unpolluted environment, biodiversity, and safe food and 
water can help to lure discerning tourists and increase 
their spending.370
Another benefit is seen in shifting the energy sector 
from coal-fired power plants to cleaner gas-fired plants, 
and, better yet, to low-polluting renewable energy sources 
such as wind, tidal, geothermal, and solar. These 
interventions not only reduce pollution and improve the 
cardiorespiratory health of entire popu­lations, but they 
will also sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and 
increase the efficiency of electricity generation. 371
Additional benefits are produced by controlling urban 
air pollution by upgrading public transportation, 
encouraging active transport (walking and cycling), 
reducing sulphur content of motor fuels, promoting use 
of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles (while 
concurrently cleaning the energy supply), and restricting 
car and trucks from city centres. These interventions not 
only improve air quality, but will also reduce childhood 
asthma, reduce incidence of cardiovascular disease, 
stroke, and diabetes in adults, and enhance the quality of 
urban life.372,373
Another benefit in controlling pollution is that 
remediation of highly contaminated sites in densely 
Panel 9: Partial successes in reducing air pollution from cookstoves
China’s National Improved Stove Programme
•	
China’s National Improved Stove Programme (1982–92) has distributed 180 million 
improved cookstoves to people in rural areas of China, in conjunction with provincial 
programmes. This programme is among the world’s largest and most successful 
national programmes for improved stoves.363 The initiative aimed primarily to increase 
efficiency and thus reduce the use of biomass fuel. Middle-income households were 
targeted in this programme, and households were expected to purchase the stoves 
themselves.364  All improved cookstoves had chimneys, and some had blowers for 
more efficient combustion.
•	 With regard to the primary objective of achieving better fuel efficiency, China’s 
programme lowered household air pollution levels, but, unfortunately, this 
reduction was not sufficient to meet China’s indoor air quality standards and 
substantial exposures remained. A fundamental problem was that the stove designs 
did not reduce emissions, but focused on fuel efficiency and, at best, moved the 
smoke outside, where it still caused exposures. Nevertheless, the programme 
showed that large-scale effects could be achieved by a well organised and well 
supported effort that was coordinated nationally, but with substantial local 
participation. Additionally, an epidemiological study of household stove 
improvement that was undertaken in a cohort of 21 232 Chinese farmers from 
1976 to 1992 showed that stove improvement was associated with a greater 
than 30% reduction in incidence of lung cancer.365
Indian National Programme on Improved Chulha
•	
A second national programme at a similar scale to the Chinese programme, the Indian 
National Programme on Improved Chulha stoves, which operated from about 1984 to 
2001, was reported to have had little effect on fuel efficiency nationally, and even less 
in reducing long-term exposure to smoke.366
Gyapa Stoves Project, Accra, Ghana
•	
An African example of a successful cookstove intervention was the Gyapa Stoves 
Project in Accra, Ghana. In 2000, 95% of Ghanaian households used solid fuels to 
power stoves.367 This was a much higher percentage than the estimated 73·4% for the 
rest of northwest Africa. Many homes in Ghana were poorly ventilated and the burning 
of solid fuels, such as savannah wood, was inefficient and contributed to deforestation 
and ecosystem imbalance. To address this problem, EnterpriseWorks/VITA, Shell 
Foundation, and USAID partnered in 2002 to implement a programme to replace 
traditional coal-pots with improved stoves called the Gyapa Stove. The Gyapa stove 
requires 50–60% less fuel than traditional stoves and produces less smoke. This project 
was unusual in that it aimed to create a sustainable business model that helped the 
local economy by creating jobs to manufacture the stoves. In 2008, 68 000 stoves 
were sold in Accra and Kumasi. Air quality was found to have improved by 40–45%.The Lancet Commissions

populated areas will reduce the prevalence of poisoning 
by toxic chemicals and heavy metals, will enhance land 
values, and encourage urban redevelopment. Brownfield 
remediation projects have been successful in covering 
the expense of clean-up by the private sector.200
Reductions of exposures to lead from pottery 
(panel 11)374–376 and paint will reduce childhood lead 
poisoning and thus enhance the intelligence, creativity,169 
and economic productivity of entire societies.46
A final benefit of pollution control results from bans on 
the production and use of asbestos, which will reduce 
asbestosis, lung cancer, and malignant mesothelioma 
and will therefore produce substantial gains in economic 
productivity by preventing serious illness and premature 
death and will also result in reductions to health-care 
costs. In conclusion, well designed and executed pollution 
control strategies will advance attainment of many of the 
UN’s SDGs.16
Essential components of pollution control programmes
Planning processes that prioritise interventions against 
pollution, link pollution control to protection of public 
health, and integrate pollution control into development 
strategies are the first step to dealing with pollution. 
Defining and prioritising interventions enables a focus 
on 
cost-effectiveness 
and 
creates 
roadmaps 
for 
comprehensive solutions.
The key societal underpinnings for successful pollution 
control at any level of development include courageous 
and visionary leadership by heads of government—
mayors, governors, and heads of state—along with an 
engaged, informed, and empowered civil society. It is 
also important that there be a shared societal 
commitment to protecting human health and advancing 
social justice and a carefully designed, evidence-driven 
package of pollution control policies.
Effective plans to control pollution require support 
from many sectors of society and, therefore, must 
involve collaborations among many agencies and 
organisations within and outside governments, and 
nationally and internationally. These stakeholders must 
be fully inte­grated into a city’s or a country’s development 
agenda. If they are to be successful, these efforts must 
include not only ministries of health and environment, 
but also ministries of finance, energy, industry, 
agriculture, and transport. Pollution control policy 
cannot exist in isolation.
Successful strategies rely on a mix of primary 
prevention approaches that eliminate pollution at source, 
coupled with downstream pollution control technologies, 
such as filters and stack scrubbers, that remove pollutants 
from the waste stream after they have already been 
formed. Examples of highly transformative strategies for 
pollution control that are based on primary prevention 
include shifting the mix of energy sources in a city or 
country away from polluting fuels toward non-polluting, 
renewable fuels;377 use of safer feedstocks in industrial 
production, such as feedstocks produced by the 
burgeoning technologies of green chemistry, which 
eliminate use of hazardous feedstuffs and production of 
materials that can cause injury to human health and the 
environment;378 incentivising the adoption of clean 
production technologies; and enhancing access to 
efficient, affordable public transportation.379 Primary 
prevention can also be achieved by banning highly 
hazardous and carcinogenic materials such as asbestos, 
benzene, PCBs, and DDT, as has been successfully 
achieved in many countries. Primary prevention of 
pollution based on the elimination of pollution at source 
is inherently more effective than downstream control 
technologies, such as stack scrubbers or water filters that 
reduce the amount and toxicity of pollutant emissions 
after they have already been formed. Primary prevention 
of pollution at source is also essential for accelerating 
transition to a more sustainable, circular economy.
Further elaboration of these themes and case studies on 
pollution control are presented in the appendix 
(pp 63–82). The key elements of all successful pollution 
control plans are discussed in the following sections.
Panel 10: Cleaner fuels and indoor air
In the past 2 years, major advances have made clean fuels more available in several 
countries. Examples of programmes to introduce cleaner fuels are the following:
The Indian liquefied petroleum gas programme
•	
In 2016, India set a goal of providing access to liquefied petroleum gas to 50 million 
additional poor families in 3 years through a large programme that was operated 
through the national oil companies. In 2016, more than 10 million households have 
already been targeted through the national Give it Up campaign, in which middle class 
families voluntarily give up their liquefied petroleum gas subsidy to a family who are 
below the poverty line, and corporate responsibility funds are earmarked for the 
upfront costs.
Ecuador’s electric induction stove programme
•	
In Ecuador, the national government has developed a major programme to change 
every traditional cookstove in the country to an electric induction stove. Electric 
induction stoves are 50% more efficient and faster than gas or normal electric 
cooking, and have other advantages, including improved safety. This transition is 
possible because Ecuador has nearly universal electrification, much of it derived from 
hydroelectric projects. Other countries, including Paraguay and Bhutan, also have 
hydropower potential, and both are currently undertaking preparatory studies.
•	
Ultimately, it is clear that any household use of solid fuel has negative effects on 
health and that the eventual goal should be the elimination of solid fuel and its 
replacement with cleaner sources of energy. In the interim, in areas and countries 
where elimination of solid fuel is not immediately possible, transition to the cleanest 
biomass stoves should be strongly encouraged.119 Millions of lives can be extended 
every year among the poorest populations in the world by such a transition, but the 
challenges are still great. 
•	
Progress in implementing clean energy is tracked by the International Energy Agency 
at both the national and sectoral levels, which has shown some advances in the 
generation of cleaner energy nationally, but inadequate progress in meeting 
transportation goals. The International Energy Agency concludes that “strong actions 
linked to stated targets need to be pushed forward to achieve the clean energy 
potential”.The Lancet Commissions

Establish ambitious but attainable targets and 
timetables for pollution control
Targets and timetables are essential for programmes to 
control pollution; these provide benchmarks and metrics 
for assessing progress towards pollution control. This 
Commission recommends establishing specific numerical 
targets and deadlines for pollution control and prevention 
of pollution-related disease in every city and country, along 
with incentives for meeting deadlines and penalties for 
failing to meet them.
Pollution control targets must be appropriate for each 
country’s level of income and development and guided by 
the WHO pollution control targets. These targets will be 
most effective when they are focused on pollution sources 
that are established to be priorities and must be integrated 
into commitments to meet the SDGs and to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Prioritise interventions
It is crucial that pollution control programmes establish 
and adhere to a robust, systematic, and transparent 
system for prioritising pollution control that is based on 
assessment of health effects, environmental damages, 
and cost-effectiveness of control of various pollution 
sources. A robust system for assigning priority will avoid 
the pitfall of prioritising interventions on the basis of 
political expediency380,381 or because they happen to be an 
item in the evening news.
Quick, highly visible successes are extremely important 
in gaining public support for a pollution control 
programme. It is therefore essential that intervention 
plans identify pollution sources whose early control will 
result in quick wins. Rapid, measurable improvements in 
public health, especially in the health of children, are 
powerful levers for building public and political support.
Key steps in ranking pollution sources in terms of 
their health effects, a key process of an effective health 
and pollution action plan, are as follows: (1) examine the 
frequency and severity of disease attributed to various 
types of pollution using data from national sources and 
data from the GBD study, and use this information to 
prioritise interventions against pollution; (2) for each 
type of pollution apportion the relative contributions of 
different exposure sources; (3) evaluate the efficacy of 
new programmes that have potential to reduce health 
effects from each pollution source, review existing 
programmes for efficacy and reach, and identify 
performance gaps and legal, regulatory, and enforce­
ment gaps; (4) identify potential interventions (new and 
expanded) for those exposures for which there are 
dramatic effects on health outcomes and measurable 
indirect benefits, and evaluate these interventions for 
cost-effectiveness; (5) focus not only on high-visibility 
sources of pollution, but also on pollution sources that 
historically have received less attention, such as 
household air pollution, contaminated sites, lead 
(including lead in pottery glazes, lead in paint, and lead 
from other sources that might be specific to a specific 
culture), and occupational risks, including asbestos; 
(6) review the benefits of interventions against pollution 
and health improvement, considering the roles of 
gender equity, alleviation of poverty, slowing of the pace 
of climate change, increased tourism, economic growth, 
improved education, and political factors (panel 12);382–387 
(7) bring all relevant agencies into the prioritisation 
process, including senior representatives of ministries 
of 
health, 
environment, 
industry, 
development, 
finance, transport­ation, energy, planning, and legislative 
branches, and civil society, if possible; and (8) begin 
implementation with those programme areas where 
past experience will be a strong return on investment, 
as measured by benefit to public health and the 
possibility for early victories: examples include 
removing lead from paint or pottery, cleaning up highly 
visible toxic hotspots, banning asbestos, or publishing a 
ranked list of the most important pollution sources in a 
city or country, involving the media in advertising early 
successes.
Establish robust systems for environmental monitoring 
and public health tracking
High quality metrics that monitor pollution and track 
progress towards national and local pollution prevention 
and disease control goals are essential to the success of 
any health and pollution action plan. Early establishment 
of public health and environment monitoring systems 
should therefore be a priority. Evidence-driven updates at 
Panel 11: Mexico’s challenge: combating lead pollution
Pottery is produced in more than 10 000 artisanal, mostly small scale, workshops across 
Mexico. Most workshops use inexpensive, low temperature kilns that are not capable of 
firmly binding lead glaze to the clay. Lead is therefore released from the glaze into food. 
Lead has been used for centuries to glaze pottery in Mexico, and pottery is a pervasive 
source of population exposure to lead.374–376 Beginning in the 1990s, the Mexican 
Government determined that prevention of lead poisoning must be a national public 
health priority and launched a multipronged approach strategy that included 
interventions against the use of lead in pottery.
The following are key elements of the control strategy:
•	
Undertake a comprehensive survey of artisanal workshops, to identify those using 
lead-based glazes
•	
Track producers and distributors of lead-based glaze and distributors and producers of 
lead-free glaze to understand the routes to market
•	
Notify producers and intermediaries that Mexican federal standards impose an absolute 
prohibition on the use of lead-based glazes in ceramics used for preparing or serving food
•	
Engage with producers of lead-free glaze to assist them in improving their product to 
better match the appearance of lead-glazed ceramics and to facilitate distribution
•	
Create market incentives for use of lead-free ceramics
•	
Strengthen enforcement of the federal lead glaze standard through improved 
monitoring and targeted inspections
•	
Launch a broad communications campaign to educate pottery makers and the public 
about the dangers of lead-glazed pottery and to advertise the high quality and 
enhanced safety of lead-free glazesThe Lancet Commissions

regular intervals are crucial. We encourage governments 
to consider creation of a central data coordination system 
that acts as a focus and point of reference for all data on 
pollution—household, ambient, and occupational. This 
system should provide validated information and 
synthesised reports to the public and could be a basic 
source of raw data for regulators, researchers, and 
policy makers.
The economic costs of pollution include not only 
productivity and health costs, but also costs resulting 
from destruction of ecosystems and loss of key species 
such as pollinators and fish stocks that convey great 
benefits to human beings and are crucial to sustaining 
life on earth. Like the economic losses that result from 
pollution-related disease, the costs of environmental 
degradation are mostly invisible. These costs are not 
captured by standard economic indicators and are buried 
within the uncounted, unpaid costs of modern industrial 
and agricultural production.
The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity is a 
global initiative sponsored by the UN Environment 
Programme that addresses the challenge of quantifying 
the economic losses that result from environmental 
degradation. This initiative applies a structured approach 
to valuation of ecological losses, explores the visible and 
invisible costs and benefits that flow from ecosystems 
into the economy, and evaluates how these flows might 
change under different policy interventions. The 
initiative examines the potential consequences of policy 
reforms that realign incentives and fiscal policy in both 
negative (ie, polluter-pays) and positive (ie, beneficiary-
pays) ways. These scenarios can be analysed and 
juxtaposed against a scenario in which no changes are 
made, to identify more sustainable pathways.388–390
Monitoring air pollution typically involves a combination 
of ground-level monitoring and atmospheric dispersion 
modelling to determine air pollution concentrations and 
their distribution.391,392 Low-cost air pollution monitors to 
measure levels of pollutants on the ground represent an 
important advance.393 The use of satellite-based remote 
sensing to estimate levels of air pollution is gaining 
increased 
attention, 
although 
the 
coverage 
and 
interpretation of satellite data is still being refined.394
The importance of accurate epidemiological data for the 
prevention and control of disease has been recognised 
since the work of pioneers such as William Farr,338 who 
documented patterns of disease and death during the 
great cholera epidemic in Britain of 1848–49. National and 
international programmes for the systematic collection, 
consolidation, evaluation, and rapid dis­semination of data 
on morbidity and mortality have become a core 
component of the global public health infrastructure.395,396
There are still many gaps in knowledge, especially in 
poor countries with insufficient resources for systematic 
data collection.397 Therefore, only a third of the world’s 
population and only 5% of Africa has usable information 
on causes of death. China and India have both been 
redeveloping their verbal autopsy registration systems, in 
which cause of death is based on data provided by field-
trained personnel, and these data systems are im­
proving.398 Limitations in the quality of public health data 
reduce the accuracy of global estimates of the burden of 
disease related to pollution.
Accountability
Accountability is of paramount importance, and 
programmes for pollution control and prevention must 
be continuously assessed and held accountable to targets 
and deadlines using both process metrics (the number of 
regulations established, monitors installed, or tests 
performed) and outcome measures (reductions in levels 
of pollution in air and water, or improvements in health 
status). Monitoring data and data on progress toward 
achieving targets and timetables must be made publicly 
accessible to citizens and civil society.399–401
Carefully selected metrics provide an essential 
foundation to monitoring and accountability. The Health 
Effects Institute has developed a taxonomy of metrics 
that can be used to track the progress of pollution control 
programmes. Regarding air pollution programmes, a 
summary of metrics suggested by The Health Effects 
Institute include regulatory metrics, emissions metrics, 
and pollutant metrics.399
Establish a sound chemicals management programme
A high proportion of the 140 000 chemicals and pesticides 
in commerce have never been adequately tested for safety 
Panel 12: Cost-effective policies to improve access to safe water and sanitation
Disinfection kits for home drinking water and ceramic filters are low-cost technologies 
for purifying drinking water in rural households without access to safe water. Latrines are 
a cost-effective solution to open defecation. Chlorination of home drinking water costs 
between US$50 and $125 per lifeyear saved; ceramic filters cost between $125 and 
$325.382
A seemingly attractive solution to improving access to safe drinking water and improving 
sanitation would be for donors to distribute chlorination kits, filters, and latrines free of 
charge. Empirical studies have shown, however, that this approach is ineffective and 
wastes resources because not all households will use disinfection kits for home drinking 
water, even when they are provided free of charge. A better solution would be to charge 
for the technology and subsidise the purchase. Studies suggest that people who pay 
something for a product are more likely to use it.383 Another effective approach is to 
distribute vouchers to households that can be redeemed when a kit is purchased.384 
Requiring households to redeem the voucher separates the households that are likely to 
use the kit from those that are not.
Lowering the price of ceramic drinking water filters and latrines, which have a large 
upfront cost, can substantially increase their uptake.385,386 However, subsidies can be 
expensive. Microfinancing schemes that spread the cost of water filters or latrines over 
time have been effective in increasing uptake at a lower cost to funders than total 
subsidies.387 This approach allows a larger number of households to be covered for a given 
expenditure of funds and has the added benefit of gaining household and community 
ownership of the improvement. Composting toilets might have some advantages in 
some circumstances, for example where there is no sewage system.

or toxicity.36 Information on potential toxicity is publicly 
available for only about half of the commercial chemicals 
with high production volume that are in widest use, and 
information on developmental or reproductive toxicity is 
available for fewer than 20% of these widely used 
chemicals.402 Because of the failure to test chemicals for 
toxicity, populations around the world today are exposed 
to hundreds of untested chemicals and recurrent 
episodes of disease and environmental degradation 
have resulted.36
To address the problem of population exposure to 
untested chemicals of unknown hazard, high-income 
countries are beginning to develop chemicals manage­
ment programmes.403,404 Mandatory testing of chemicals 
for safety and potential toxicity, coupled with the 
imposition of controls or bans on the manufacture and 
use of toxic chemicals are the two linchpins of these 
policies.36 High-income countries have the resources to 
establish their own chemical testing programmes such 
as those supported by the European Chemical Agency and 
the US National Toxicology programme. Low-income 
and middle-income countries must rely on results from 
those testing agencies and on findings on chemical 
safety and toxicity promulgated by international bodies 
of high repute that are independent of the chemical 
manufacturing industry such as WHO’s Inter­national 
Programme on Chemical Safety,109 the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer, UN Environment 
Programme,101 and the Ramazzini Institute.
Establish and enforce environmental laws and 
regulations and base regulation on the polluter-pays 
principle
A strong body of law405 and clear, transparent, impartially 
enforced regulations are crucial components of policy 
packages for pollution control in all countries.
Experience in the USA documents the importance of 
law and regulation in reducing pollution. Through 
national regulations established under the US Clean Air 
Act, the USA has reduced concentrations of six common 
air pollutants by 75% since 1970 while increasing GDP by 
nearly 250% (figure 1).43 Every dollar invested in control 
of ambient air pollution in the USA is estimated to yield 
US$30 in benefits (95% CI $4–88).45
The State of California has also deployed a suite of 
laws and policies to control air pollution that, in some 
instances, 
are 
even 
stronger 
than 
US 
federal 
regulations.406 California’s policies to reduce traffic-
related air pollution include low-emission vehicle 
standards, a low-sulphur gasoline standard, diesel 
emissions standards, and financial incentives for 
replacement and retrofit of high-polluting vehicles. 
Additional policies that have been very successful 
include requirements for cleaner diesel fuels in marine 
vessels and railroad locomotives, and requirements for 
cleaner diesel fuels for stationary diesel engines and 
agricultural equipment. Policies to reduce emissions 
from stationary pollution sources include legally 
mandated reductions in emissions of oxides of nitrogen 
and sulphur, mandatory reviews of emissions from new 
sources, and source-specific emissions standards. 
Application of these standards has resulted in reductions 
in levels of major air pollutants by more than 70% in 
California, produced measurable improvements in 
children’s respiratory health,44 and has accomplished 
these goals in a time when the GDP has risen sharply, 
thus documenting, yet again, that control of pollution 
does not stifle economic development or societal 
advancement.43
Application of the polluter-pays principle is an 
important component of environmental regulation. The 
imposition of legally mandated requirements that 
polluters pay for their pollution and its clean-up create a 
powerful incentive to adopt new, more efficient 
production technologies that will reduce pollution. 
Application of the polluter-pays principle forces 
polluting industries to acknowledge and account for the 
previously externalised costs of pollution. Lastly, 
application of the polluter-pays principle can generate 
revenues that help to support the costs of pollution 
control programmes.
As a corollary to imposing the polluter-pays principle, it 
is important that governments also end subsidies to 
polluting industries such as coal, oil, gas, and chemical 
production. When polluting industries are granted 
subsidies by governments, these governments and the 
taxpayers who support them are indirectly paying to be 
polluted.
A competent, independent, non-corrupt judiciary 
provides an essential back-up to environmental laws and 
regulation.407 An independent judiciary is needed to 
ensure the fair and impartial application of regulatory 
standards and to protect people, especially indigenous 
people and their lands, from the damaging effects of 
polluting industrial activities. For further discussion on 
existing national and international chemical control 
legislation and agreements, see the appendix (pp 13–14).
Engage with the private sector
This Commission emphasises that multiple stakeholders 
should be involved in controlling pollution and 
preventing pollution-related disease, including top 
government leaders, but also key civil servants, business, 
academia, and civil society. Carefully listening to the 
views of the most important and influential stakeholders 
(both formal and informal) can help to ensure that all the 
parties who can advance (or derail) programmes are 
taken into account.77 
Enlightened business leaders can be powerful 
advocates for pollution control and disease prevention. 
The creation of incentives by governments for non-
polluting industries can be powerful catalysts for 
innovative action, as seen by the rapid development of 
solar power systems and the organic food industry.

Support city-level initiatives to encourage active 
transport: reward walking and cycling, increase access 
to and affordability of public transport, and minimise 
use of motorised transport
Cities now house more than half of the world’s population, 
a fraction that is growing rapidly, are responsible for 
75% of greenhouse gas emissions, and account for 85% of 
global economic activity.408,409 Cities, especially rapidly 
growing cities in low-income and middle-income 
countries, have some of the world’s highest concentrations 
of ambient air and chemical pollution and the highest 
prevalence of disease caused by these forms of pollution.
Important initiatives are now underway in cities around 
the world to reduce emissions of both pollutants and 
greenhouse gases, and to make cities more resilient and 
sustainable. Several organisations at the local, national, 
and global levels have contributed to this progress and they 
include the Regional Plan Association in New York, the 
World Bank’s Eco2Cities initiative, and the UN Department 
of Economic and Social Affairs urbanisation planning 
programmes.
Mayors have been powerful actors in efforts to control 
pollution and pollution-related disease, and visionary 
mayors have resurrected formerly blighted cities and 
turned them into places of extraordinary beauty and 
high livability.410 This Commission commends initiatives 
to launch urban design and planning initiatives that 
reimagine cities through building green spaces, parks, 
and walkways, encouraging active transport (such as 
walking and cycling), and increasing access to and 
affordability of public transport. Such programmes are 
discussed in detail in the 2016 Lancet Series on City 
Planning and Population Health.411,412
Willingness to confront vested interests
Planning and prioritisation processes regarding health 
and pollution do not always proceed smoothly. The 
analyses 
regarding 
trade-offs 
between 
economic 
development and pollution are nuanced and vary 
substantially from industry to industry and country to 
country. In general, when public health externalities are 
included in the assessment, even primary industries like 
heavy manufacturing and mining achieve better long-
term macroeconomic performance when strong controls 
for pollution management are in place.413,414  However, 
these analyses can be complex and often contentious. 
Projections of growth rates and of the burden of 
pollution-related disease should look at sliding ranges of 
benefit, since low-polluting industries might provide 
substantial net benefits to a community. Heads of 
government who successfully confront vested interests, 
bring agencies together, reduce environmental injustice, 
control pollution, and prevent pollution-related disease 
can reap great praise, build a legacy, help the world 
achieve the SDGs, and earn an honoured place in history.
The next section of this Commission report outlines the 
contributions that various stakeholders—government, 
civil society, and health professionals—can make to 
pollution control.
Responsibilities of governments and major foundations
National, state or provincial, and city governments are 
powerful actors in efforts to control pollution and prevent 
pollution-related disease. Governments in countries at all 
levels of income have made remarkable victories against 
pollution.
Leadership by the head of government—the President, 
Prime Minister, Governor or Mayor—is of the utmost 
importance. Heads of government are uniquely well 
positioned to educate the public and the media about the 
importance of preventing pollution-related disease and 
can create a vision for a country or a city without pollution. 
These heads of government also have the power to bring 
together several agencies within their governments—
health, environment, finance, transport, industry, energy, 
and development—to make pollution control a priority.
Heads of government also have great power to address 
the so-called “political economy” of pollution.415 Much 
pollution, especially industrial pollution, is produced by 
vested interests that profit by externalising the costs of 
production and discharging unwanted wastes into the 
environment. These individuals and organisations will 
typically resist efforts to control pollution. Heads of 
government have unique power to overcome this 
resistance and to negotiate just settlements that reduce 
pollution and achieve social justice. Experience in 
countries at all levels of income shows that pollution 
control can be accomplished in the face of powerful 
opposition, but that the task is seldom easy and requires 
committed leadership and broad partnerships across 
civil society.
Responsibilities of international agencies
International development organisations, including UN 
agencies, multilateral development banks, bilateral 
funding agencies, private foundations, and non-
governmental organisations, have important respon­
sibilities in pollution control and prevention of 
pollution-related disease that complement and extend the 
role of governments. These agencies should elevate 
pollution prevention within the agendas of international 
development and global health and substantially increase 
the resources they devote to pollution, establishing it as a 
priority in funding mechanisms.
These agencies should build on existing global data 
platforms to develop a central platform to monitor and 
coordinate information on all forms of pollution globally, 
and should consider convening a bi-annual conference 
on pollution.
International agencies should also provide resources to 
reduce pollution-related disease in low-income and 
middle-income countries by:
(1) encouraging the development of action plans 
regarding health and pollution, both nationally andThe Lancet Commissions
500	
www.thelancet.com    Vol 391   February 3, 2018
regionally, and of specific pollution control projects that 
set time targets; (2) building data tracking systems to 
collect 
information 
on 
pollution 
and 
disease; 
(3) supporting direct interventions against pollution 
where such actions are urgently needed to save lives; 
(4) supporting interventions against pollution when 
international action can leverage local action and 
resources; (5) building professional and technical 
capacity within governments; (6) strengthening the 
capacity of universities in low-income and middle-
income countries to research environmental health 
science and to train future health and environmental 
professionals; and (7) supporting research programmes 
in environmental health science in partnership with 
international academic institutions, including clinical 
and epidemiological studies to learn more about 
the undiscovered links between pollution and non-
communicable disease.
This 
Commission 
also 
calls 
on 
international 
foundations and private donors to come together with 
governments around the world to establish dedicated 
international development funding specifically dedicated 
to the control of industrial, vehicular, mining, and 
chemical pollution. Such funding will be most effective 
in curbing pollution when its award is contingent upon 
host countries’ implementation of the polluter-pays 
principle and ending financial subsidies and tax breaks 
for polluting industries.
Several design options for dedicated pollution control 
funding could be considered. The first is a new 
standalone fund analogous to GAVI (the Vaccine 
Alliance) or the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria, in which private philanthropists and 
foundations provide start-up monies that are then 
periodically replenished by governments. Another option 
is a large trust fund that is hosted and managed by an 
existing global institution, such as a multilateral 
development bank or a foundation. Alternatively, a virtual 
fund with contributions based on explicit agreements 
could be used. Finally, expansion of existing funding 
instruments for international development assistance 
could be used, including funds specifically designated 
for pollution control.
Responsibilities of citizens and civil society
Citizens and civil society organisations in countries and 
cities around the world have important responsibilities 
in the prevention of pollution, and non-governmental 
organisations have an important role in many countries 
in holding governments and companies accountable for 
pollution control and prevention of pollution-related 
disease. Civil society organisations can contribute to 
pollution control by acting as watchdogs, by serving as 
representatives of the public interest, and by advocating 
for 
specific 
policies, 
regulations, 
and 
practices 
(panel 13).350 Civil society groups, especially those that are 
well funded and science-based, are a powerful force to 
represent poisoned populations. These organisations can 
highlight omissions in policy and advocate for change.416 
The best of these organisations provide solid policy 
support to government action and take a long-term, 
broad view of issues in their actions and recom­
mendations.417
Responsibilities of health professionals
Physicians, nurses, and other health professionals have 
important responsibilities in helping societies to confront 
the challenges of pollution and pollution-related disease 
as they have educated societies around the world about the 
dangers of nuclear war and global climate change.
Health professionals can begin by controlling pollution 
and reducing carbon emissions from hospitals and 
health-care facilities and by reducing pollution and 
carbon-intensive energy sources in their own lives. 
Health professionals can support local, regional, and 
national planning efforts and emphasise the links 
between pollution and health, develop new trans­
disciplinary educational curricula that build knowledge 
of environmental health science and about the health 
Panel 13: Case study: the power of civil society in controlling urban air pollution
National and city governments have key roles in solving pollution problems. But 
governments cannot act alone. The political will to create, implement, and sustain 
successful pollution control policies over the long term requires the involvement of 
citizens and civil society from many sectors. For example, in the winter of 2010–11, hourly 
air quality data from Beijing began, for the first time, to be publicly released by both the 
Chinese Government and the United States Embassy. Soon thereafter, so-called 
“airpocalypses” during winter were documented, and Beijing’s air quality data began to be 
discussed extensively in local and international media. This unprecedented access to 
real-time air quality data spurred software developers to build apps, pushing the data out 
to millions. Through apps, social media, and general media outlets, the citizens of Beijing 
began, for the first time, to feel the air pollution problem in new, immediately accessible, 
and data-driven ways.
Since that time, China has invested in several programmes to mitigate air pollution. 
An expanded network of air quality monitors has been installed in Beijing and across the 
country. Stricter regulatory policies have been implemented. New emergency action plans 
for high-pollution days have been developed and promulgated. Simultaneously, public 
interest in pollution has not waned. In 2015, a popular television journalist, Chai Jing, 
made an independent documentary “Under the Dome” that discussed the effects of air 
pollution on health, which went viral across the country and then the world. The number 
of research publications on air pollution in Beijing have exponentially increased.
It is difficult to pinpoint the exact contributions of the policy, activism, technology, 
research, and media communities to the successful pollution control effort in Beijing and 
their effects on each other, but clearly their combined efforts are beginning to make a 
positive difference. Since 2014, government sources in Beijing have reported year-to-
year decreases in annual average PM2·5 concentrations, and these findings are consistent 
with data for decreasing concentrations of PM2·5, as calculated from the monitor on 
the United States Embassy.350
Although Beijing and China still have a long way to go to clean their air, this case study

effects of pollution, and support research in exposure 
science, environmental science, health policy research 
and health economics.
Partnerships between government, civil society, and 
the health professions have proven powerfully effective 
in past struggles to control pollution. For example, in 
the ultimately successful effort to remove lead from 
gasoline, which was fiercely resisted for many years by 
the lead industry, partnerships were built between 
govern­ment agencies, health professionals, and civil 
society organisations.
Interventions against pollution
Table 7 gives a brief overview of interventions, effective 
policy solutions, and institutional needs by pollution type. 
Strategies to improve water and sanitation and to reduce 
indoor air pollution typically take the form of subsidies, 
especially in low-income countries, whereas policies to 
reduce pollution from stationary and mobile sources 
usually rely on regulation, often in the form of standards. 
Many of these strategies are policy-based and enforcement-
based,418 not requiring large governmental investments.
Section 5: Conclusion—the way forward
Pollution is the largest environmental cause of disease 
and premature death in the world today. Pollution poses a 
massive challenge to planetary health15 and deserves the 
concentrated attention of national and international 
leaders, civil society, health professionals, and people 
around the world. Yet, despite its far-reaching effects on 
health, the economy and the environment, pollution—
especially the rapidly growing threat of industrial, 
vehicular, and chemical pollution in low-income and 
middle-income countries—has been neglected in the 
international assistance and the global health agendas. 
Strategies for control of industrial, chemical, and 
automotive pollution in developing countries have been 
deeply underfunded.49,50
The goal of this Commission is to raise global awareness 
of the importance of pollution, to end neglect of pollution-
related disease, and to mobilise the resources and the 
political will that are needed to effectively confront 
pollution.
To achieve this aim and advance progress toward the 
elimination of pollution, members of this Commission

and contributors to this report have initiated a series of 
activities within different sectors and countries that will 
extend beyond the life of this Commission and are 
intended to prevent pollution and save lives. At a global 
level, several authors of this Commission are in early 
stages of designing a Global Pollution Observatory, to be 
housed within the Global Alliance for Health and 
Pollution. This new observatory will be an international, 
multidisciplinary collaboration that is focused on 
coordinating information regarding all forms of pollution 
in countries around the world and developing solutions 
based on successes already achieved in other countries. 
We intend that this observatory will operate in close 
partnership with the Institute for Health Metrics and 
Evaluation, UN agencies, Future Earth, the Planetary 
Health Alliance, and major non-governmental organ­
isations concerned with the wellbeing of the Earth’s 
environment. A major function will be to provide data 
that assist countries in prioritising pollution initiatives, 
tracking pollution, and using pollution control metrics, 
including investments against pollution in countries 
around the world and to make these data publicly and 
easily available. The precise metrics to be followed are 
under consideration, but possibilities include monitor­ing 
country-by-country data on the status of regulations 
against each type of pollution; measuring exposures to 
key 
pollutants, 
country-by-country 
and 
regionally; 
reporting detailed country-by-country statistics on disease 
and premature death by pollution risk factor, to track 
performance towards the goals suggested in this report; 
tracking national and international investment into 
expanded research on disease and death due to pollution 
(especially soil pollution caused by heavy metals and toxic 
chemicals), including studies to discover new and 
previously unrecognised health effects of pollutants; 
tracking investments related to interventions against 
pollution, country-by-country (which can be broken down 
by source of investment and whether the investment is 
national or international and public or private); and 
developing a database to report the cost-efficacy of 
interventions against pollution, measured in terms of 
health outcomes. 
In partnership with The Lancet, the Global Alliance on 
Health and Pollution plans to revisit the data on health 
and pollution periodically, and to publish updated 
information on global trends in pollution, pollution-
related disease, and pollution control on a regular basis. 
The Global Alliance on Health and Pollution will also 
explore hosting a biennial conference on pollution that will 
include UN agencies, governments, and representatives 
of civil society and will review pollution control strategies, 
share project successes, and explore opportunities and 
the most cost-effective strategies for pollution control.
At the country level, work is underway to expand health 
and pollution planning in partnership with governments 
in low-income and middle-income countries. This work 
involves multiple organisations and agencies, including 
the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, the World 
Bank, WHO, the UN Environment Programme, and the 
UN Development Programme. New programmes to 
educate global leaders and government agencies about 
proven solutions to pollution are also in development.
Activities to strengthen the involvement of the public 
and civil society in pollution control are essential because 
public concern provides a major impetus for governments 
to act against pollution. A new website is being developed 
by the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution to show 
current and, in some cases, real-time data related to 
pollution in countries across the world. This geocoded 
website links databases showing air pollution, water 
pollution, and soil contamination. Users can zoom down 
to the communities where they live, see the available 
information, and post their own stories and pictures about 
pollution. The website will incorporate a link for people to 
connect with local government organisations for solutions.
These efforts are only the beginning, and there is much 
more to be done. This Commission encourages all efforts 
to bring the issue of pollution to public attention and 
supports all solutions to reduce the enormous health 
burden of this major, yet often hidden, global threat.
Contributors
PJL and RF developed the concept and objectives for the Commission. 
The full Commission met on two occasions (Nov 9–11, 2015, and 
June 16–17, 2016) in New York, NY, USA, with an additional meeting in 
January, 2016 (limited to the Health and Pollution working group, also in 
New York). The Commission formed four working groups to examine the 
burden of disease associated with environmental pollution, to calculate 
the economic costs of documented pollution-attributable global deaths 
and DALYs, to explore the intersection between pollution and inequality, 
and to evaluate and develop strategies and roadmaps for successful 
pollution control. Each working group was responsible for the design, 
drafting, and review of their individual sections. Working Group 1 
(Health) was led by PJL. Working Group 2 (Economics) was led by MLC 
and AK. Working Group 3 (Environmental Justice) was led by KS. 
Working Group 4 (Interventions) was led by DHa and RF. Working 
Group leaders, along with Yewande Awe of the World Bank and 
Tim Kasten of UN Environment comprised the Report Steering 
Committee. All authors contributed to the identification of key issues and 
the selection of four main report sections. As co-chairs of the 
Commission, PJL and RF planned and coordinated all activities of the 
Commission, the development and review of the report drafts, and the 
preparation for external peer review. PJL and RF reviewed and edited all 
sections of this report. All authors reviewed each stage of the report and 
approved the final version. PJL wrote the first and subsequent drafts of 
the Introduction, with input from OA, MLC, RF, AH, AK, KVM, JP, and 
KRS. For Section 1, PJL wrote the first and subsequent drafts, with input 
from NB, RB, SB-O’R, JIB, PNB, TC, CM, JF, VF, DHu, BLa, KM, CJLM, 
FP, LDS, PDS, KRS, WAS, OCPvS, and GNY. For Section 2, MLC and AK 
wrote the first and subsequent drafts, with input from MG, PJL, KVM, 
and ASP. For Section 3, KS wrote the first and subsequent drafts, with 
input from OA, AH, PJL, KVM, MAM, JRo, KRS, AS, and GNY. For 
Section 4, DHa wrote the first draft, with subsequent drafts written and 
edited by RF and PJL, with input from NJRA, OA, RA, ABB, NB, AMCS, 
JF, AH, DHu, MK, BLo, KM, MAM, JDN, JP, JRa, JRo, CS, KRS, AS, 
RBS, KY, and MZ. 
Declaration of interests
BLa served as an expert witness in California for the plaintiffs in a public 
nuisance case of childhood lead poisoning, in a Proposition 65 case on 
behalf of the California Attorney General’s Office, in a case involving 
lead-contaminated water in a new housing development in Maryland, in 
a Canadian tribunal on a trade dispute about using lead-free galvanised

lead-poisoned children in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but he received no 
personal compensation for these services. His expert witness fees are 
deposited in a research and training fund at Simon Fraser University 
(Burnaby, BC, Canada). MG reports grants from the US Agency for 
International Development, the National Science Foundation, the 
International Growth Centre, and the Laura and John Arnold 
Foundation outside the submitted work; MG also reports more than 
US$10 000 in stocks and bonds, including in firms that pollute and firms 
that are affected by pollution, as part of a diversified portfolio. All other 
authors declare no competing interests.

Global burden of 87 risk factors in 204 countries and 
territories, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019
GBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators*
Summary
Background Rigorous analysis of levels and trends in exposure to leading risk factors and quantification of their effect on 
human health are important to identify where public health is making progress and in which cases current efforts are 
inadequate. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 provides a standardised and 
comprehensive assessment of the magnitude of risk factor exposure, relative risk, and attributable burden of disease.
Methods GBD 2019 estimated attributable mortality, years of life lost (YLLs), years of life lived with disability (YLDs), 
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 87 risk factors and combinations of risk factors, at the global level, 
regionally, and for 204 countries and territories. GBD uses a hierarchical list of risk factors so that specific risk factors 
(eg, sodium intake), and related aggregates (eg, diet quality), are both evaluated. This method has six analytical steps. 
(1) We included 560 risk–outcome pairs that met criteria for convincing or probable evidence on the basis of research 
studies. 12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 no longer met inclusion criteria and 47 risk–outcome pairs for 
risks already included in GBD 2017 were added based on new evidence. (2) Relative risks were estimated as a function 
of exposure based on published systematic reviews, 81 systematic reviews done for GBD 2019, and meta-regression. 
(3) Levels of exposure in each age-sex-location-year included in the study were estimated based on all available data 
sources using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression method, or 
alternative methods. (4) We determined, from published trials or cohort studies, the level of exposure associated with 
minimum risk, called the theoretical minimum risk exposure level. (5) Attributable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs 
were computed by multiplying population attributable fractions (PAFs) by the relevant outcome quantity for each age-
sex-location-year. (6) PAFs and attributable burden for combinations of risk factors were estimated taking into account 
mediation of different risk factors through other risk factors. Across all six analytical steps, 30 652 distinct data sources 
were used in the analysis. Uncertainty in each step of the analysis was propagated into the final estimates of 
attributable burden. Exposure levels for dichotomous, polytomous, and continuous risk factors were summarised 
with use of the summary exposure value to facilitate comparisons over time, across location, and across risks. Because 
the entire time series from 1990 to 2019 has been re-estimated with use of consistent data and methods, these results 
supersede previously published GBD estimates of attributable burden.
Findings The largest declines in risk exposure from 2010 to 2019 were among a set of risks that are strongly linked to 
social and economic development, including household air pollution; unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; and 
child growth failure. Global declines also occurred for tobacco smoking and lead exposure. The largest increases in 
risk exposure were for ambient particulate matter pollution, drug use, high fasting plasma glucose, and high body-
mass index. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for attributable deaths was high systolic blood pressure, 
which accounted for 10·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 9·51–12·1) deaths (19·2% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths 
in 2019), followed by tobacco (smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted for 8·71 million (8·12–9·31) 
deaths (15·4% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths in 2019). The leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable DALYs globally in 2019 
was child and maternal malnutrition, which largely affects health in the youngest age groups and accounted for 
295 million (253–350) DALYs (11·6% [10·3–13·1] of all global DALYs that year). The risk factor burden varied 
considerably in 2019 between age groups and locations. Among children aged 0–9 years, the three leading detailed 
risk factors for attributable DALYs were all related to malnutrition. Iron deficiency was the leading risk factor for those 
aged 10–24 years, alcohol use for those aged 25–49 years, and high systolic blood pressure for those aged 50–74 years 
and 75 years and older.
Interpretation Overall, the record for reducing exposure to harmful risks over the past three decades is poor. Success 
with reducing smoking and lead exposure through regulatory policy might point the way for a stronger role for public 
policy on other risks in addition to continued efforts to provide information on risk factor harm to the general public.

Introduction
The mechanism for much of disease and injury preven­
tion is through modifying environmental, occupational, 
behavioural, and metabolic risk factors. Other pathways, 
such as vaccination or addressing social determinants 
of health, are crucially important, but a substantial 
component of public health has targeted modifying the 
aforementioned risk factors. Whether the risk factor is 
targeted through public policy such as taxation or 
regulation, through programmes such as water supply 
improvement, or primary care advice and pharmacological 
intervention, it is essential to track progress on risk 
exposure. Which risk factors are declining, stagnating, or 
even increasing gives insights into where current efforts 
are working or are insufficient. Understanding where the 
promise of prevention is being realised might generate 
lessons that can be applied to other risks in which progress 
is slow. Tracking the burden attributable to risk exposure, 
measured by deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived 
with disability (YLDs), or disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), can also help governments, donor agencies, 
international organisations, and civil society organisations 
to identify new priorities.1–3
To help track risk exposures and the burden 
attributable to these exposures, many studies are pub­
lished each year on the burden of specific risks, often 
in specific countries or regions.4–7 To our knowledge, 
the only effort to examine attributable burden with 
standardised methods across a wide set of risk factors 
spanning all countries is the Global Burden of Diseases, 
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD).8–12 Many choices 
go into the comparable quantification of the burden of 
risk factors; GBD provides a rules-based approach to 
evidence synthesis that follows the Guidelines on 
Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting.13 
Comparable quantification across risks over time 
and across populations facilitates identi­fying relative 
importance and how population health risks are 
evolving over time. GBD also provides a framework 
to understand both the trends in risk exposure and 
the trends in burden attributable to risks. Quantifying 
and reporting both exposure and attributable burden is 
important because exposure might be increasing and 
attributable burden decreasing if other drivers of the 
underlying outcomes are declining at a fast enough 
rate.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) 2017 provided the most recent assessment of deaths, 
years of life lost because of premature mortality, years of life 
lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years 
attributable to metabolic, environmental and occupational, 
and behavioural risk factors. GBD 2017 provided estimates from 
1990 to 2017 for 195 countries and territories. Many reports 
explore the burden of disease that can be attributed to a specific 
risk factor in a specific country or territory, region, or globally, 
but none attempts to assess an extensive list of risk factors in all 
countries and regions.
Added value of this study
GBD 2019 advances the technical quantification of attributable 
burden in 12 ways. (1) In support of the agreement between GBD 
and WHO, nine new countries have been added to the analysis: 
Cook Islands, Monaco, San Marino, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Saint Kitts 
and Nevis, Tokelau, and Tuvalu. (2) Subnational assessments for 
Italy, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Poland have been 
added to GBD 2019. (3) High and low non-optimal temperatures 
have been added as risk factors (54 new risk–outcome pairs). 
(4) For 81 risk–outcome pairs, new systematic reviews have been 
done as part of GBD 2019. (5) For 139 risk–outcome pairs, 
dose–response meta-regressions have been done to evaluate if 
the relationship between exposure and relative risk might not be 
adequately captured by assuming a log-linear relationship 
between risk and per unit increase in exposure. (6) On the basis of 
the systematic reviews and dose–response meta-regression, 
12 risk–outcome pairs have been excluded from GBD 2019 
because they no longer met inclusion criteria. (7) On the basis of 
the systematic reviews and meta-regressions, 47 new risk–
outcome pairs have been included for risks that were previously 
included. This includes outcomes linked to low birthweight and 
short gestational age as intermediate outcomes linked to 
particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 2·5 μm (PM2·5), 
which has increased the burden attributable to PM2·5. (8) New 
cohorts, trials, and case-control studies have been added for the 
assessment of risk functions. (9) New sources have been added 
to the analysis of risk factor exposure by age, sex, and location. 
(10) Corrections for non-reference method exposure 
measurements have been revised using network or related 
meta-regression. (11) For dietary risks, the theoretical minimum 
risk exposure level (TMREL) has been revised based on the new 
systematic reviews. (12) The distribution of alcohol use across 
individuals has been revised to better capture the asymmetric 
nature of the distribution. In addition to the technical 
improvements in each step of the quantification of risk factor 
exposure, relative risk, TMREL, and attributable burden, in this 
study we have focused attention on the broad trends in risk 
exposure by computing summary exposure values for 
aggregations of risk factors. Isolating the long-term global and 
national trends in risk exposure reveals in which cases the world 
has been successful in reducing exposure to harmful risks.
Implications of all the available evidence
Improved analysis of risk exposure and burden attributable to 
risk factors at the national, regional, and global level can help to 
focus attention on risks for which exposure is increasing and in 
which locations. This quantification is an essential input into 
public health prioritisation and evaluation of programme 
success.Global Health Metrics

In this study, we present new or updated results for 
the quantification of 560 risk–outcome pairs including 
updated data for exposure, updated data for relative risks, 
methods innovation in evaluating risk-exposure functions, 
and the addition of two new risk factors—high and 
low non-optimal temperatures. In addition to providing 
quanti­fication of exposure and attributable burden in 
204 locations over the period 1990–2019, we used summary 
exposure values (SEVs) for aggregates of risk factors to 
understand where public health is making progress 
tackling the major environmental, occupational, beha­
vioural, and metabolic risk factors, and where it is not.
Methods
Overview
The GBD 2019 estimation of attributable burden fol­
lowed the general framework established for comparative 
risk assessment (CRA)14,15 used in GBD since 2002. Here, 
we provide a general overview and details on major 
innovations since GBD 2017. More detailed methods are 
available in appendix 1. CRA can be divided into six key 
steps: inclusion of risk–outcome pairs in the analysis; 
estimation of relative risk as a function of exposure; 
estimation of exposure levels and distributions; deter­
mination of the counterfactual level of exposure, the level 
of exposure with minimum risk called the theoretical 
minimum risk exposure level (TMREL); computation of 
population attributable fractions and attributable burden; 
and estimation of mediation of different risk factors 
through other risk factors such as high body-mass index 
(BMI) and ischaemic heart disease, mediated through 
elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), elevated fasting 
plasma glucose (FPG), and elevated LDL cholesterol, to 
compute the burden attributable to various combinations 
of risk factors.10
Geographical units, age groups, and time periods
GBD 2019 estimated prevalence of exposure and attri­
butable deaths, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs for 23 age 
groups; males, females, and both sexes combined; 
and 204 countries and territories that were grouped 
into 21 regions and seven super-regions. GBD 2019 
includes subnational analyses for Italy, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
the Philippines, and Poland, and 16 countries previously 
estimated at subnational levels (Brazil, China, Ethiopia, 
India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, New 
Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, 
and the USA). All subnational analyses are at the 
first level of administrative organi­sation within each 
country except for New Zealand (by Māori ethnicity), 
Sweden (by Stockholm and non-Stockholm), the UK 
(by local government authorities), and the Philippines 
(by province). In this publication, we present subnational 
estimates for Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, 
Mexico, Sweden, the UK, and the USA; given space 
constraints, these results are presented in appendix 2. 
For this cycle, nine countries and territories (Cook 
Islands, Monaco, San Marino, Nauru, Niue, Palau, 
Saint Kitts and Nevis, Tokelau, and Tuvalu) were added, 
such that the GBD location hierarchy now includes 
all WHO member states. These new locations were 
previously included in regional totals by assuming 
that age-specific rates were equal to the regional rates. 
At the most detailed level, we generated estimates 
for 990 locations. The GBD diseases and injuries 
analytical framework generated estimates for every year 
from 1990 to 2019.
GBD risk factor hierarchy
Individual risk factors such as low birthweight or 
ambient ozone pollution are evaluated in the GBD CRA. 
In addition, there has been policy interest in groups of 
risk factors such as household air pollution combined 
with ambient particulate matter. To accommodate these 
diverse interests, the GBD CRA has a risk factor hier­
archy. Level 1 risk factors are behavioural, environmental 
and occupational, and metabolic; Level 2 risk factors 
include 20 risks or clusters of risks; Level 3 includes 
52 risk factors or clusters of risks; and Level 4 includes 
69 spe­cific risk factors. Counting all specific risk factors 
and aggregates computed in GBD 2019 yields 87 risks or 
clusters of risks. For a full list of risk factors by level, see 
appendix 1 (section 5, table S2).
Determining the inclusion of risk–outcome pairs in GBD
Since GBD 2010, we have used the World Cancer Research 
Fund criteria for convincing or probable evidence of risk–
outcome pairs.16 For GBD 2019, we completely updated our 
systematic reviews for 81 risk–outcome pairs. Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses flowcharts on these reviews are available in 
appendix 1 (section 4). Convincing evidence requires more 
than one study type, at least two cohorts, no substantial 
unexplained heterogeneity across studies, good-quality 
studies to exclude the risk of confounding and selection 
bias, and biologically plausible dose–response gradients. 
For GBD, for a newly proposed or evaluated risk–outcome 
pair, we additionally required that there was a significant 
association (p<0·05) after taking into account sources of 
potential bias. To avoid risk–outcome pairs repetitively 
entering and leaving the analysis with each cycle of GBD, 
the criteria for exclusion requires that with the available 
studies the association has a p value greater than 0·1. 
On the basis of these reviews and meta-regressions, 
12 risk–outcome pairs included in GBD 2017 were excluded 
from GBD 2019: vitamin A deficiency and lower respiratory 
infections; zinc deficiency and lower respiratory infections; 
diet low in fruits and four out­comes: lip and oral cavity 
cancer, nasopharynx cancer, other pharynx cancer, and 
larynx cancer; diet low in whole grains and two outcomes: 
intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemor­
rhage; intimate partner violence and maternal abortion 
and miscarriage; and high FPG and three outcomes: 
chronic kidney disease due to hyper­tension, chronic

kidney disease due to glomerulonephritis, and chronic 
kidney disease due to other and unspecified causes. 
In addition, on the basis of multiple requests to begin 
capturing important dimensions of climate change into 
GBD, we evaluated the direct relationship between high 
and low non-optimal temperatures on all GBD disease and 
injury outcomes. Rather than rely on a heterogeneous 
literature with a small number of studies examining 
relationships with specific diseases and injuries, we ana­
lysed individual-level cause of death data for all locations 
with available information on daily temperature, location, 
and Inter­national Classification of Diseases-coded cause of 
death. These data totalled 58·9 million deaths covering 
eight countries. On the basis of this analysis, 27 GBD 
cause Level 3 outcomes met the inclusion criteria for each 
non-optimal risk factor (appendix 1 section 2.2.1) and were 
included in this analysis. Other climate-related relation­
ships, such as between precipitation or humidity and 
health outcomes, have not yet been evaluated.
Estimating relative risk as a function of exposure for 
each risk–outcome pair
In GBD, we use published systematic reviews and for 
GBD 2019, we updated these where necessary to include 
any new studies that became available before Dec 31, 2019. 
We did meta-analyses of relative risks from these studies 
as a function of exposure (appendix 1 sections 2.2.2, 4). For 
GBD 2019, 81 new systematic reviews were done, including 
for 44 diet risk–outcome pairs. To allow for risk functions 
that might not be log-linear, we relaxed the meta-regres­
sion assumptions to allow for monotonically increasing 
or decreasing but potentially non-linear func­tions for 
147 risk–outcome pairs. Appendix 1 (section 2) provides the 
mathematical and computational details for how we 
implemented this approach for meta-regression. 218 risk–
outcome pairs were estimated assuming log-linear 
relationships. For 126 risk–out­come pairs, exposure was 
dichotomous or polytomous. For 37 risk–outcome pairs, 
the population attributable fractions were assumed by 
definition to be 100% (eg, 100% of diabetes is assumed to 
be, by definition, related to elevated FPG). For 32 risk–
outcome pairs, other approaches were used that reflected 
the nature of the evidence that has been collected for 
those risks (appendix 1 section 4). For risks that affect 
cardiovascular outcomes, we adjusted relative risks by age 
such that they follow the empirical pattern of attenuation 
seen in published studies for elevated SBP, FPG, and LDL 
cholesterol.
Estimation of the distribution of exposure for each risk 
by age-sex-location-year
For each risk factor, we systematically searched for 
pub­lished studies, household surveys, censuses, admin­
istrative data, ground monitor data, or remote sensing 
data that could inform estimates of risk exposure. To 
estimate mean levels of exposure by age-sex-location-year, 
specific methods varied across risk factors (appendix 1 
sections 2.1, 4). For many risk factors, exposure data were 
modelled using either spatiotemporal Gaussian process 
regression or DisMod-MR 2.1,17,18 which are Bayesian sta­
tistical models developed over the past 12 years for GBD 
analyses. For most risk factors, the distribution of exposure 
across individuals was estimated by modelling a measure 
of dispersion, usually the SD, and fitting an ensemble of 
parametric distributions to the predicted mean and SD. 
Ensemble distributions for each risk were estimated 
based on individual-level data. Details for each risk factor 
modelling for mean, SD, and ensemble distribution are 
available in appendix 1 (section 4). Because of the strong 
dependency between birthweight and gestational age, 
exposure for these risks was modelled as a joint distribution 
using the copula method.19
In many cases, exposure data were available for the 
reference method of ascertainment and for alternative 
methods, such as tobacco surveys reporting daily smoking 
versus total smoking; in these cases, we esti­mated the 
statistical relationship between the reference and alter­
native methods of ascertainment using network meta-
regression and corrected the alternative data using this 
relationship.
Determining the TMREL
For harmful risk factors with monotonically increasing 
risk functions, the theoretical minimum risk level was 
set to 0. For risk factors with J-shaped or U-shaped risk 
functions, such as for sodium and ischaemic heart 
disease or BMI and ischaemic heart disease, the TMREL 
was determined as the low point of the risk function. 
When the bottom of the risk function was flat or 
poorly determined, the TMREL uncertainty interval (UI) 
captured the range over which risks are indistinguishable. 
For protective risks with monotonically declining risk 
functions with exposure, namely risk factors where 
exposure lowers the risk of an outcome, the challenge is 
selecting the level of exposure with the lowest level of 
risk strongly supported by the available data. Projecting 
beyond the level of exposure supported by the available 
studies could exaggerate the attributable burden for a 
risk factor. In these cases, for each risk–outcome pair, we 
determined the exposure level at the 85th percentile of 
exposure in the cohorts or trials used in the risk meta-
regression. We then generated the TMREL by weighting 
each risk–outcome pair by the relative global magnitude 
of each outcome. Appendix 1 (section 2.4 and 4) provides 
details on the TMREL estimation for each risk.
Estimation of the population attributable fraction and 
attributable burden
For each risk factor j, we computed the population 
attributable fraction (PAF) by age-sex-location-year using 
the following general formula for a continuous risk: 
PAFjoasgt= ∫x=lRRjoasg(x)Pjasgt(x)dx – RRjoasg(TMRELjas)
u
∫x = lRRjoasg(x)Pjasgt(x)dx
uGlobal Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 396   October 17, 2020	
1227
where PAFjoasgt is the PAF for cause o, for age group a, 
sex s, location g, and year t; RRjoasg(x) is the relative risk as 
a function of exposure level x for risk factor j, for cause o 
controlled for confounding, age group a, sex s, and 
location g with the lowest level of observed exposure as l 
and the highest as u; Pjasgt(x) is the distribution of exposure 
at x for age group a, sex s, location g, and year t; and 
TMRELjas is the TMREL for risk factor j, age group a, and 
sex s. Where risk exposure is dichotomous or polytomous, 
this formula simplifies to the discrete form of the 
equation.
Estimation of the PAF took into account the risk 
function and the distribution of exposure across 
individuals in each age-sex-location-year. By drawing 
1000 samples from the risk function, 1000 distributions 
of 
exposure 
for 
each 
age-sex-location-year, 
and 
1000 samples from the TMREL, we propagated all of 
these sources of uncertainty into the PAF distri­butions. 
PAFs were also applied at the draw level to the uncer­
tainty distributions of each associated outcome for that 
age-sex-location-year.
Estimating the PAF and attributable burden for 
combinations of risk factors
For the estimation of each specific risk factor, the 
counterfactual distribution of exposure is the TMREL 
for that specific risk with no change in other risk factors. 
Thus, the sum of these risk-specific estimates of attri­
butable burden can exceed 100% for some causes, such 
as cardiovascular diseases. It is also useful to assess the 
PAF and attributable burden for combinations of 
risk factors, such as all diet components together or 
household air and ambient particulate matter pollution. 
To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, we 
should take into account how one risk factor might be 
mediated through another (eg, the effect of fruit intake 
might be partly mediated through fibre intake). We used 
the mediation matrix as developed in GBD 201712 to try 
to correct for overestimation of the PAF and the attri­
butable burden for combinations of risks if we were to 
simply assume independence without any mediation. 
Appendix 1 (section 5, table S6) provides the estimated 
mediation matrix.
Summary exposure value
As in previous rounds of GBD, we summarised expo­
sure distributions for dichotomous, polytomous, and 
continuous risk factors using the SEV. The SEV 
compares the distribution of excess risk times exposure 
level to a population where everyone is at maximum 
risk.
For a given risk r and outcome c pair where RRmax is 
the relative risk at the 99th percentile of the global 
distribution of exposure. We then averaged across 
outcomes to compute the SEV for a given risk as
where N(c) is the total number of outcomes for a risk. 
The SEV is effectively excess risk-weighted prevalence, 
which allows for comparisons across different types of 
exposures. Maximum risk in the denominator of the SEV 
is determined by the relative risk at the 99th percentile of 
the global distribution of exposure. The SEV is on a 
0–100 scale where 100 means the entire population is at 
maximum risk and 0 means everyone in the population 
is at minimum risk. We computed age-standardised 
SEVs by age-standardising age-specific SEVs across the 
age groups in which that risk factor was evaluated; this 
method is a change from GBD 2017 in which age-
standardisation included age groups in which the risk 
was not evaluated. For example, the SEV for low 
birthweight is now age-standardised across age groups 
0–6 days to 7–27 days.
To estimate SEVs for groups of risk factors, we first 
estimated the value of RR2 without mediation through 
risk 1 (RR2/1).
where RR2 is the relative risk of risk factor 2 and MF2/1 is 
the mediation factor, or the proportion of the risk of risk 
factor 2 that is mediated through risk factor 1. We then 
computed the PAF using the non-mediated relative risk 
(RR1/2) and computed the joint PAF as
We cannot simply multiply RRmax values used for the 
SEV of each component risk as this would exaggerate 
the joint RRmax. We approximated the 99th percentile of 
risk for the combination of risk factors by taking the 
geometric mean of the ratio between the individual 
risk maximum risk and the individual risk global mean 
risk and multiplied that by the global mean joint risk. 
Formally,
where N(r) is the total number of risks. 
Risk-deleted death rates
We computed risk-deleted death rates as the death 
rates that would be observed if all risk factors were set 
to their respective TMRELs. This was calculated as 
the death rate in each age-sex group multiplied by

Global exposure to risks
The table shows the trends in risk exposure for each risk 
factor at the global level over two time intervals: the full 
duration of the study, 1990–2019, and the past decade, 
2010–19. On the basis of this table, we can divide risks 
into three groups based on the percentage change in 
the global SEV from 2010 to 2019: substantial declines 
(annual rate of change larger than –0·5%), substantial 
increases (annual rate of change greater than 0·5%) and 
the remainder of risks with either non-significant rates 
of change or significant rates of change between –0·5% 
and 0·5%. The declining risks fall into two categories. 
First, a set of risks that are strongly linked to social 
and economic development, measured by the Socio-
demographic Index (SDI): household air pollution; 
unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing; child growth 
failure; vitamin A deficiency; and zinc deficiency. The 
second set of declining risks includes tobacco smoking 
and lead, which historically have not been negatively 
correlated with SDI. These risks could in fact increase as 
countries and territories increase SDI, at least for a phase 
in the development process. For a long list of risk factors, 
including some large risks, the annual rate of change 
was either statistically insignificant (p>0·05) or the 
annual rate of change was between –0·5% and 0·5% per

year: ambient ozone pollution, high temperature, low 
temperature, residential radon, occupational risks, sub-
optimal breastfeeding, short gestation, low birthweight, 
iron deficiency, chewing tobacco, dietary risks as a group, 
intimate partner violence, low physical activity, high 
LDL cholesterol, low bone mineral density, and kidney 
dysfunction. Many of these stagnating risks have been or 
are targets of concerted public health efforts spanning 
public policy, targeted programmes, and primary care 
intervention.
Concerning for both current and future health are 
the exposures that are increasing at more than 0·5% per 
year. This list includes ambient particulate matter 
pollution, alcohol use, drug use, childhood sexual 
abuse, bullying victimisation, high FPG, high SBP, and 
high BMI. Many of the increasing risks are metabolic 
risk factors; in fact, taken together, the exposure to 
metabolic risks increased 1·37% per year (95% UI 
1·17–1·56) from 1990 to 2019 and 1·46% per year 
(1·26–1·69) from 2010 to 2019. Figure 1A, which shows 
the trends in the age-standardised SEV for each risk 
factor compared with the fraction of global DALYs 
attributable to each risk factor, further emphasises 
these patterns. In 2019, there were three risks that 
accounted for more than 1% of DALYs and were 
increasing in age-standardised SEVs by more than

1% per year, dominating the figure: high FPG, high 
BMI, and ambient particulate matter pollution. Reductions 
in risks that currently still have large attributable burden 
are almost exclusively those inversely associated with 
rising SDI, except smoking. It might be assumed that 
effective efforts to reduce risk exposure have been 
concentrated on the world’s largest risk factors, but we 
see no discernible pattern between trends in exposure 
and attributable burden. The global trends shown in 
the table and figure 1 give a high-level view of how well 
the world is managing exposure to an extensive list 
of harmful risks, but regional and country trends can 
be markedly variable. Figure 1B shows trends for 
the largest risks in terms of global attributable age-
standardised DALY rates for countries grouped into 
quintiles of SDI in 2019. There is considerable variation 
across quintiles in trends in exposure. Notably, ambient 
particulate matter pollution exposure is increasing in 
the low SDI up to middle SDI quintiles but decreasing 
in the high SDI quintile. High FPG and high BMI are 
increasing in all quintiles, as is alcohol use. Smoking is 
declining in all SDI quintiles. Regional and national 
trends in SEVs are available in appendix 2 (table S1).
Figure 2A provides an alternative way to consider 
the link between risk exposures and overall trends in 
mortality. Removing the effect of all risk factors included 
in this study leads to large percentage reductions in 
mortality in those younger than 5 years and in the middle 
and older age groups. Risk reduction can have a slightly 
larger effect on male mortality than female mortality; in 
other words, some of the difference between male and 
female life expectancy can be explained by risk exposures. 
The percentage of age-specific mortality explained by all 
risk factors combined in 1990 is very similar to the 
share shown in figure 2A (appendix 2 table S3). Figure 2B 
shows the annualised rate of decline in risk-deleted 
age-specific mortality from 1990 to 2019. Risk-deleted 
mortality rates declined from 1990 to 2019 in all age 
groups other than in those aged 95 years and older, 
declining between 1·0% and 3·3% per year for all the age 
groups younger than 75 years, and at lower rates for 
those aged 75 years and older. The substantial declines in 
risk-deleted mortality rates are likely to be related to 
reductions in risks not included in our assessment, 
reductions in case-fatality rates, or other factors. The 
observed rates of decline for all-cause mortality for ages 
younger than 10 years and older than 65 years have been 
faster than the risk-deleted rates, suggesting reduction 
of risks included in our analysis has played a role in 
progress in these age groups, particularly in those 
younger than 5 years. Notably, risk-deleted death rates 
have declined faster than observed rates, particularly for

Global attributable burden
Figure 3A and 3B show global attributable deaths for 
females and males in 2019 for the 20 risk factors at Level 2 
of the risk factor hierarchy (appendix 2 table S3) The top 
five risks for attri­butable deaths for females were high 
SBP (5·25 million [95% UI 4·49–6·00] deaths, or 20·3% 
[17·5–22·9] of all female deaths in 2019), dietary risks 
(3·48 million [2·78–4·37] deaths, or 13·5% [10·8–16·7] of 
all female deaths in 2019), high FPG (3·09 million 
[2·40–3·98] deaths, or 11·9% [9·4–15·3] of all female 
deaths in 2019), air pollution (2·92 million [2·53–3·33] 
deaths or 11·3% [10·0–12·6] of all female deaths in 2019), 
and high BMI (2·54 million [1·68–3·56] deaths or 9·8% 
[6·5–13·7] of all female deaths in 2019). For males, the top 
five risks differed slightly. In 2019, the leading Level 2 risk 
factor for attributable deaths globally in males was tobacco 
(smoked, second-hand, and chewing), which accounted 
for 6·56 million (95% UI 6·02–7·10) deaths (21·4% 
[20·5–22·3] of all male deaths in 2019), followed by high 
SBP, which accounted for 5·60 million (4·90–6·29) deaths 
(18·2% [16·2–20·1] of all male deaths in 2019). The third 
largest Level 2 risk factor for attributable deaths among 
males in 2019 was dietary risks (4·47 million [3·65–5·45] 
deaths, or 14·6% [12·0–17·6] of all male deaths in 2019) 
followed by air pollution (ambient particulate matter and 
ambient ozone pollution, accounting for 3·75 million 
[3·31–4·24] deaths (12·2% [11·0–13·4] of all male deaths 
in 2019), and then high FPG (3·14 million [2·70–4·34] 
deaths, or 11·1% [8·9–14·1] of all male deaths in 2019). 
Outside of the top five, there were large differences 
between attributable deaths in males and females due to 
alcohol use, which accounted for 2·07 million (1·79–2·37) 
deaths in males and 0·374 million (0·298–0·461) deaths in 
females in 2019. Newly included in GBD 2019, non-optimal 
temperature accounted for 1·01 million (0·880–1·15) 
deaths in males and 0·946 million (0·812–1·09) deaths in 
females. For both sexes combined, the leading Level 2 risk 
factor for deaths was high SBP, accounting for 10·8 million 
(9·51–12·1) deaths in 2019 (19·2% [16·9–21·3] of all deaths 
that year), followed by tobacco, with 8·71 million 
(8·12–9·31) deaths (15·4% [14·6–16·2] of all deaths that 
year).
When viewed in terms of DALYs (figure 3C, D), the 
ranking of Level 2 risk factors reflects the differential ages 
of death and the contribution of non-fatal disease 
burden. Most notably, child and maternal malnutrition 
(including low birth­weight, short gestation, child growth 
failure, non-optimal breastfeeding, and low intake of 
micronutrients), which has predominant health effects 
among the young, was the second leading Level 2 risk 
factor for males and leading risk factor for females in 
2019, accounting for 11·5% (95% UI 10·1–13·1) of DALYs 
for males and 11·7% (10·5–13·2) of DALYs for females. 
Tobacco was ranked first for males and seventh for 
females in terms of attributable DALYs. For both sexes 
combined, the leading Level 2 risk factor globally for 
attributable DALYs was child and maternal malnutri­
tion, at 295 million (95% UI 253–350) DALYs in 2019 
(11·6% [10·3–13·1] of all DALYs that year).

attributable DALYs, both for SDI quintiles and the 21 GBD

low SDI quintile, the most important risk factors were 
malnutrition; air pollution; and water, sanitation, and

led to marked changes in risk rankings from 1990 to 2019. 
In 1990, the leading risk factors were child wasting, 
low birthweight, short gestation, and household air 
pollution, all of which have dropped substantially in 
magnitude in terms of percentage of attributable DALYs

and rank by 2019. The leading risks in 2019 were high 
SBP, smoking, high FPG, low birthweight, and high 
BMI. Other notable shifts include the large increase in 
percentage of attributable DALYs and rank for ambient 
particulate matter pollution, high LDL cholesterol, and 
alcohol use. Among the youngest age group (0–9 years), 
shown in figure 5B, the leading Level 4 risk factors 
were composed exclusively of malnutrition and environ­
mental risk factors. Over the 1990–2019 period, there 
were substantial reductions in the burden attributable to 
these risk factors in both absolute numbers and rates. 
The largest declines among the leading ten risks were 
for child growth failure (child underweight, stunting, 
and wasting); water, sanitation, and handwashing; 
and house­hold air pollution. Large but more moderate 
declines in attributable burden occurred for short 
gestation and low birthweight, with the smallest reduc­
tion observed for ambient particulate matter pollution.
Among adolescents and young adults (aged 10–24 years; 
figure 5C), the pattern of risk factor burden was notably 
different from the 0–9 years age group, with iron 
deficiency, alcohol use, and unsafe sex ranking first to

low birthweight also increased in importance.
In the 25–49 years age group (figure 5D), alcohol use was 
the leading Level 4 risk factor for attributable burden, 
followed by high SBP and then high BMI, smoking, unsafe 
sex, and high FPG. The number of DALYs increased for all 
the top ten risks, but age-standardised attributable DALY 
rates increased only for high BMI, unsafe sex, high FPG, 
drug use, and ambient particulate matter pollution. In the 
two oldest age groups, the set of leading risks are quite 
similar to one another, dominated by high SBP at the top, 
and followed by other metabolic risk factors including 
high FPG, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, and kidney 
dysfunction. Smoking also contributed substantially to 
the risk attributable burden in these age groups, ranked 
second in ages 50–74 years (figure 5E) and third in ages 
75 years and older (figure 5F). In the oldest age group, 
low temperature was also one of the top ten risks, 
although 
age-standardised 
attributable 
DALY 
rates 
declined from 1990 to 2019. Sex-specific rankings by age 
group are available in appendix 2 (figures S4, S5).
National findings
The leading risk factors for attributable DALYs had 
highly varied geographical patterns, as shown in figure 6, 
which presents maps of the percentage of burden 
attributable to the top five Level 2 risk factors globally 
in 2019. The highest proportions (greater than 20%) of 
burden attributable to the leading Level 2 risk factor 
in 2019, child and maternal malnutrition, were seen 
in most of western, central, and eastern sub-Saharan 
African regions (figure 6A). In addition, rates greater 
than 20% were seen in Afghanistan, Pakistan, states in 
northern India, Yemen, and Papua New Guinea. Rates 
between 10% and 20% were seen in a diverse set of 
central American countries, states in Brazil, Tajikistan, 
Uzbekistan, Myanmar, regions of the Philippines, and 
some Indonesian provinces.
Figure 6B shows the burden attributable to the second 
leading Level 2 risk factor in 2019, high SBP. Locations 
with more than 20% of DALYs attributable to high SBP 
included Georgia and most of central and eastern 
Europe. Most countries in north Africa and the Middle 
East had between 10% and 20% of DALYs attributable to 
high SBP as did states in southern India and many parts 
of southeast Asia. The only countries with less than 
2% of all-age DALYs attributable to high SBP were in 
western sub-Saharan Africa.

The third leading Level 2 risk factor, tobacco, is shown 
in figure 6C. Locations with more than 20% of DALYs 
attributable in 2019 include countries in the Balkan 
Peninsula and two provinces in China—Liaoning and 
Heilongjiang. Most countries in Europe had between 
10% and 20% of DALYs attributable to smoking; Canada, 
most states in the USA, Russia, the rest of China, and 
many parts of southeast Asia were also in this category. 
Attributable burden remains less than 6% in most of 
Mexico, central America, and Andean Latin America. 
The burden attributable to tobacco is less than 2% in 
much of western and eastern sub-Saharan Africa.
Figure 6D shows the burden attributable to air pollution 
(ambient particulate matter, household air pollution, and 
ambient ozone pollution). No location had more than 
20% of DALYs attributable to air pollution. But a wide 
range of countries in western and eastern sub-Saharan 
Africa had attributable burden percentages between 10% 
and 15%. Similarly, nearly all locations in south Asia, 
many parts of southeast Asia, and most provinces in 
China also had the same levels of attributable burden. The 
spatial patterns of the constituent risks included in air 
pollution—particularly ambient particulate matter and 
household air pollution—were quite different (see GBD 
Compare for data), with ambient particulate matter 
pollution playing a much greater role in Asia than in 
Africa.
The fifth most important Level 2 risk factor was the 
dietary risks that are based on the joint effects of 15 diet 
quality components (figure 6E). In Bulgaria, dietary risks 
accounted for more than 20% of attributable DALYs. 
However, diet accounts for more than 10% of DALYs in 
many locations in central and eastern Europe, central 
Asia, and most of China. The lowest shares of DALYs 
attributed to dietary risks are in sub-Saharan Africa, 
particularly countries in the Sahel.

Discussion
Main findings 
Our 
analysis 
of 
risk-attributable 
burden 
using 
30 652 sources for exposure, relative risk, and the TMREL 
showed that in 2019, 47·8% (95% UI 45·3–50·1) of global 
DALYs were attributed to present and past exposure for 
the 87 environmental, occupational, behavioural, and 
metabolic risk factors and combinations of risk factors 
included in this analysis. Overall, combined global expo­
sure to the risks included in this study has remained 
remarkably constant over the past 30 years. Risk-deleted 
mortality rates over the same period have declined, 
ranging from a 3·3% decline per year in females aged 
1–4 years to a 0·3% decline per year in males aged 
90–94 years. Despite this overall pattern, reductions in 
key risks highly correlated with SDI—unsafe water, 
sanitation, and handwashing; household air pollution; 
child growth failure; and vitamin A and zinc defi­
ciencies—have contributed to reductions in global child 
death rates. Among the most detailed major non-commu­
nicable disease risks, only tobacco smoking has declined 
steadily. At the global level in 2019, there were three risk 
factors that accounted for more than 1% of DALYs and 
were increasing in exposure by more than 1% per year: 
high BMI, ambient particulate matter pollution, and 
high FPG. There is large scope for public regulatory 
policy, community programmes, and primary care inter­
ventions on risks to have a greater effect on prevention. 
These broad global patterns mask considerable hetero­
geneity in risk levels and trends at the country level, 
reinforcing the need for country assessments and 
country-specific prevention planning.
Important risk factor trends
Some risk exposures are highly correlated with social 
and economic development, as measured by SDI. 
As countries and territories increase SDI through 
higher levels of education, particularly among women; 
increased GDP per capita; and improved access to 
modern contraceptives, we should expect progress on 
these risks. The incremental effect of campaigns, 
policies, and programmes on top of this social and 
economic development process is yet to be established 
in this analysis. Bending the development curve is 
possible, as evidenced by the abrupt accelerations in the 
decline in some risk factors, such as the recent decline 
in unsafe sanitation in India.20 Even for risks that 
are historically highly correlated with SDI, intervention 
can accelerate progress. The range of policy initiatives to 
accelerate the transition to cleaner cooking fuels is 
another example of this effort.21,22 Analysis of exemplars, 
countries with lower SEVs for these risks for their level 
of SDI or faster progress than expected for the change in 
SDI, could yield further insights.
Two risk factors that have not been highly correlated 
with SDI in the past have also seen declines in exposure 
at nearly 1% per year over the study period: tobacco 
smoking and lead exposure. Progress on exposure to 
these risks stands out compared with the increases in 
exposure to many metabolic risks and no substantial 
change for others such as diet quality. In both of these 
cases, government action through taxation and regulatory

policy for tobacco smoking,23 including advertising bans 
and clean air legislation, and regulation of lead content,24,25 
have had a major effect. Tobacco interventions highlight 
how regulatory policy can lead to behaviour change. 
International efforts for tobacco control have also been 
bolstered by the Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control.26 Despite the more than 1% per year decline in 
age-standardised tobacco smoking exposure between 
2010 and 2019, tobacco remains the third leading risk 
factor for attributable DALYs among Level 2 risks. For 
the three major and rapidly increasing risks, the role of 
taxation and regulatory policy should be examined. For 
ambient particulate matter pollution, regulation can 
clearly have a direct impact.27,28 For the nexus of high FPG 
and high BMI, regulatory strategies are less clear. We are 
failing to deal with these risks, and concerted research 
and policy efforts are needed to reverse the trends.
The marked rise of metabolic risks as a group, in 
particular high FPG and high BMI, and their large 
contribution to attributable burden is perhaps most 
disturbing. During this period of rising metabolic risk 
exposure, global cardiovascular disease age-standardised 
mortality has been declining as documented in GBD 2019 
for diseases and injuries.29 The seeming paradox could, to 
a large extent, be explained by the effect of access to care,30 
social determinants of health, cohort effects, and other 
behavioural, occupational, and environmental risks not 
quantified here. Rising metabolic risks might at some 
point overwhelm these other drivers and eventually lead to 
rising cardiovascular mortality in the future. This situation 
might have arrived in some high-income countries in 
which age-stan­dardised cardio­vascular disease mortality 
has plateaued or increased since 2017.31 If year-on-year 
declines in cardiovascular disease mortality come to an 
end, the effect on mortality and longevity at the global level 
could be massive. While high BMI and high FPG have 
steadily increased, high LDL cholesterol has remained 
constant over the past decade despite the expected 
correlation with BMI; this finding warrants further 
investigation and could be related to changes in diet 
quality, pharmacological intervention, or other factors. 
Although not increasing at the rate of high BMI or high 
FPG, high SBP has become the leading risk factor for 
disease burden at the global level, among the most 
detailed risks in this analysis. A range of strategies 
including primary care management and reduc­tions in 
sodium intake are known to be potentially effective in 
reducing the burden of this critical risk factor.32,33
The rise of high BMI and its probable role in increasing 
high FPG needs further examination. Increased BMI can 
be traced to the combination of physical inactivity, excess 
caloric intake, and diet quality.34 At the global level, we 
find that high BMI is rising considerably faster than low 
physical activity and poor diet quality. Diet quality on its 
own is the fifth leading Level 2 risk factor for attributable 
DALYs. The effect of diet on human health goes beyond 
diet quality and should include the contribution of diet 
intake above energy requirements. Some studies sug­
gest that certain diet components are more likely to 
contribute to increased BMI than others; the mechanism 
of these effects can be complex and include effects on 
appetite, absorption, and displacement of other foods.35 It 
is currently hard to understand the role of physical 
inactivity, excess caloric intake, and diet quality in driving 
the increase in BMI. The large combined burden of 
diet quality, physical inactivity, and high BMI (11·9% 
[95% UI 9·6–14·5] of all DALYs in 2019) indicates just 
how profoundly important the nexus of diet and physical 
activity can be to current and future health. The setting 
for understanding the potential of changes in overall diet 
is to use future health scenarios to trace how public 
policies such as subsidies, taxes, information campaigns, 
and improving accessibility can affect health in each 
country. In this study, no country or territory has had a 
significant decline in the proportion of the population 
with high BMI between 1990 to 2019 or in the past 
decade. The complete failure to reduce BMI at the 
national level implies that efforts to modify the nexus of 
physical inactivity, diet quality, and excess energy intake 
might be very challenging. Tackling this diet quality and 
excess energy intake will not only be important for 
human health but has important ramifications for 
environmental sustainability.36
The two types of exposure to particulate matter with a 
diameter of less than 2·5 μm (PM2·5) have profoundly 
different relationships with socio-demo­graphic develop­
ment: household air pollution is strongly related to SDI 
and tends to decrease steadily with socio-demographic 
development. By contrast, ambient particulate matter 
pollution tends to increase with industrialisation and 
then decline with air-quality management at higher levels 
of SDI.37,38 The global increases in ambient particulate 
matter pollution exposure are being driven by the middle 
SDI quintiles, as seen in figure 1B. Studies have shown 
that for ambient particulate matter pollution (ambient 
PM2·5), the main sources of exposure are residential 
energy use, industry, and power generation.39 The con­
centration of PM2·5 burden in south Asia highlights how 
the absence of national policy actions can have a major 
effect. Among the large risk factors in which exposure is 
increasing, ambient particulate matter pollution stands 
out because exposure is declining in countries with a 
higher SDI. Like tobacco and lead, regulation can have a 
profound effect on exposure to and health effects of 
ambient particulate matter pollution and does not require 
individual action.40,41 There is a clear role for global 
organisations to encourage regulatory change in middle 
SDI countries with large and increasing exposure to 
ambient particulate matter pollution. This agenda is all 
the more urgent because of the direct linkage to global 
climate change.
Because of profound global interest in the potential 
health effects of climate change, we have included high 
and low non-optimal temperatures in GBD 2019. ClimateGlobal Health Metrics

change will have impacts on human health through 
many mechanisms: direct effects of temperature rise, 
humidity changes, sea-level rise, extreme weather events, 
and reduced agricultural yields and increased rural 
poverty.42,43 We have so far included only one of these 
pathways in the GBD analysis, namely the direct effects 
of ambient temperature on different disease outcomes. 
Our analysis showed that the TMREL varies as a function 
of mean annual temperature. Locations where mean 
temperature is higher tend to have higher optimal 
temperatures, probably through physical and social 
adaptation. In 2019, the burden (as measured by 
percentage of total DALYs) attributable to low temperature 
was 2·2 times greater than the burden attributable to 
high temperature. This balance does not, however, hold 
true when looking at specific locations or regions. While 
for high SDI countries, the cold-related burden is 
15·4 times greater than the heat-related burden, this 
relationship is switched for other regions, such as south 
Asia where we observed a 1·7 times greater heat-related 
burden and sub-Saharan Africa where we observed 
a  3·6 times greater heat-related burden. Rising tem­
perature will probably have a substantial effect in 
locations with less capacity to adapt to increased 
temperature, potentially exacerbating health inequalities 
across countries. The social capacity to adapt is also 
probably tied to economic development: for example, air 
conditioners in the USA have mitigated the impact of 
heat waves over the past 50 years.44 In terms of trends, 
there was a marked increase in exposure to high 
temperature from 1990 to 2010 and then a slight decline 
from 2010 to 2019; there are major annual fluctuations in 
temperature exposure on top of long-term warming 
trends, and 2010 stood out as a year with high tempe­
ratures in many regions. Our analysis does not provide a 
basis for understanding the full effects of future climate 
change, which will operate through many different 
pathways in addition to the direct effects of temperature.
In the GBD CRA work to date, we have estimated the 
burden attributable to past exposure in a given year. The 
CRA framework also laid out the important utility for 
policy making of estimating how changes in current and 
future exposure can change future levels of health; this 
concept is called avoidable burden. Most CRA work to 
date has focused on estimating attributable burden, 
even though avoidable burden is arguably more relevant 
to policy prioritisation. The dominance of work on attri­
butable burden is founded on two premises: it is very 
difficult to estimate avoidable burden as this estimate 
requires a comprehensive future health scenarios frame­
work; and attributable burden is likely to be highly 
correlated with avoidable burden. With the availability of 
a GBD-informed future health scenarios platform,45,46 the 
possibility of estimating avoidable burden is much more 
tractable. Future work on avoidable burden for each GBD 
risk factor might allow us to examine the true relationship 
between the two approaches to CRA. The relationships 
between avoidable and attributable burden can vary 
across countries; in high mortality settings, competing 
risks might mean that avoidable burden will be sys­
tematically smaller than attributable burden.
For GBD 2019 and all previous GBD CRA efforts, our 
inclusion criteria for a risk–outcome pair were based on 
the World Cancer Research Fund criteria for convincing 
or probable evidence. We also required that published 
studies, when meta-analysed together, yielded a sig­
nificant (p<0·05) relative risk for any risk–outcome pair 
meeting these criteria. To avoid risk–outcome pairs on 
the cusp of statistical significance coming in and out of 
GBD with different cycles, we introduced a threshold of 
p>0·1 to exclude a risk–outcome pair that has previously 
been included in GBD. Among the included risk–
outcome pairs, the consistency of the evidence and risk 
of bias varies considerably. The evidence linking smoking 
to lung cancer is clearly far stronger than the evidence on 
omega-3 and ischaemic heart disease. The UI of the 
mean effect does not fully capture this difference in the 
consistency of evidence or the risk of bias. A more robust 
measure needs to take into account various risks of bias 
and the unexplained variation in effect after taking into 
account these risks of bias as well as the magnitude of 
the effect size. The relative risk of lung cancer from 
smoking is very high across levels of exposure, with a 
relative risk of 3·4 at ten pack-years of smoking and a 
relative risk of 6·5 at 20 pack-years of smoking, which 
makes it far more likely to be causal than an exposure 
with a relative risk of 1·1. If we included the unexplained 
heterogeneity across studies after adjusting for risk of 
bias in the UI of the relative risks, several risk–outcome 
pairs might not meet inclusion criteria. We are working 
on developing an evidence scoring system that quantifies 
consistency and risk of bias for GBD and would allow 
readers to understand that not all risk–outcome pairs 
have the same evidence base. It would, however, be 
misleading and potentially harmful to argue that we 
should only examine the GBD risk–outcome pairs 
with the highest grade of evidence. The precautionary 
principle for public policy implies that governments have 
a duty to act on risk factors that are probably or potentially 
harmful and not only those that have overwhelming 
evidence.47 Relying only on effects on the basis of the 
highest degree of evidence will very seriously delay public 
recognition and proactive policies, which in turn would 
result in perpetuating preventable burden. We hope to 
inform both individuals and public policy makers with 
quantification of burden and strength of evidence so they 
are empowered to make sense of the available data.
Analysing relative risks to inform choices by individuals 
and choices by population health decision makers might 
legitimately have different perspectives. Some guidelines 
on systematic reviews48,49 recommend reporting absolute 
risk levels related to exposure; this method is perhaps 
appropriate for informing individual choice. For public 
policy, attributable burden might be more relevant. If aGlobal Health Metrics
1244

risk factor is related to 1000 deaths, from a public policy 
perspective, the concentration of the risk in a smaller or 
larger group of individuals might matter less than it does 
to individuals. To provide a synthesis of the evidence for 
different users, we included estimation of the all-cause 
mortality relative risk associated with exposure levels of 
each risk factor using the global distribution of burden 
across outcomes. However, risks that cause relatively 
modest increases for individuals but are highly prevalent, 
such as air pollution, are, nevertheless, legitimate targets 
for public policy.
Substantial changes compared with GBD 2017
Compared with GBD 2017, our GBD 2019 estimates of 
the burden (as measured by percentage of total DALYs) 
attributable to diet quality in 2017 were 29·7% lower. 
These reductions stem from three major sources: 
changes in the crosswalks between alternative and 
reference methods for estimating diet intake, new 
systematic reviews and meta-regressions, and more 
empirical standardised methods for selecting the TMREL 
for protective factors. Although there were changes in 
the overall burden of diet, there were larger changes 
in the diet components themselves, particularly the 
substantial increase in the attributable burden from 
red meat and the decline in the burden attributable to 
low vegetable intake. The sources of the changes were 
the same as for diet quality overall. One of the most 
important insights from this enriched analysis is that for 
many harmful and protective factors, the relative risk 
functions tend to flatten out at higher exposure levels; 
the previous practice of imposing a log-linear functional 
form on the risk equation—widely used in the scientific 
literature—might have led to overestimation. For protec­
tive diet components (whole grains, fruit, fibre, nuts 
and seeds, omega-3, polyunsaturated fatty acids, veg­
etables, milk, and calcium), we set the TMREL to the 
85th percentile of levels of exposure included in the 
published cohort studies or randomised controlled trials. 
With further study of individuals with higher levels of 
intake, it is possible that the level of intake associated 
with the lowest risk is in fact higher than the TMREL 
set for protective diet components in GBD 2019. 12 diet 
risk–outcome pairs from GBD 2017 were excluded 
from GBD 2019 because our re-analysis with updated 
data suggested that the effects were no longer signifi­
cant. Some risk–outcome pairs, such as omega-3 and 
ischaemic heart disease, which remained in the analysis 
as the result of the new meta-regression of 21 trials and 
27 cohort studies, met inclusion criteria but future 
studies could shift the balance of the evidence to be 
excluded.
Particulate matter pollution burden in 2017 was 44·6% 
higher in GBD 2019 than in GBD 2017. The increase was 
due to the inclusion of low birthweight and short 
gestation as risk factors that are themselves affected by 
PM2·5, as well as increases in the relative risk curve for 
cardiovascular diseases, particularly stroke, due to newly 
added data and changes in fitting the exposure-response 
curves. Given the very large burden of low birthweight 
and short gestation on neonatal mortality, the inclusion 
of these intermediates has been an important change in 
our assessment. The burden of stroke and ischaemic 
heart disease attributable to kidney dysfunction increased 
between GBD 2017 and GBD 2019 after updating the 
relative risks with new data from 44 cohorts. For instance, 
the comparable estimate of the proportion of cardio­
vascular DALYs due to kidney dysfunction in 2010 
increased from 6·8% (95% UI 6·0–7·6) to 8·5% 
(6·8–10·3).
Limitations
In GBD 2019, we undertook a reassessment of dose–
response relationships and relaxed previous assumptions 
that the risk curve is log-linear. This reassessment was 
limited, however, to dietary risks, kidney dysfunction, and 
air pollution. Future reassess­ments of other continuous risk 
factors that currently assume a log-linear relationship could 
materially change risk factor rankings in the future and 
could also lead to exclusion of other risk–outcome pairs.
Assessment of the joint effects of risk factors depends 
on two critical factors: the correlation of risk exposure 
and the estimation of the joint effects of groups of risks 
together. For exposure, we assumed that for each age-sex-
location-year, the estimates of the prevalence of exposure 
were independent. Previous simulation analyses under­
taken for GBD 20108 with use of US data from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
suggested this assumption did not materially bias our 
findings. To assess the joint effects of risk factors, we 
assumed in general that relative risks are multiplicative. 
This simple assumption has been modified to take into 
account known pathways in which one risk factor, such 
as fruit consumption, is mediated through another risk 
factor such as fibre intake. To avoid over-estimation of 
the joint effects, we computed the non-mediated relative 
risks and then assumed that non-mediated relative 
risks are multiplicative. This approach does not capture 
potential synergy between relative risks in which some 
combinations might be super-multiplicative. For some 
areas such as diet, the joint estimation is very important 
for public policy. Further, more detailed work is needed 
to strengthen the evidence base for understanding 
mediation. In particular, mediation implies necessarily 
that exposure between mediated risks is correlated. 
Factoring in that implied correlation into risk exposure 
estimation could strengthen estimates in the future.
The main limitation of our estimates of risk-
attributable burden is the availability and quality of 
primary data that underpin the analysis. Data for risk 
relationships of several risk factors, such as ambient 
ozone pollution, residential radon, occupational risks, 
child­hood sexual abuse, intimate partner violence, 
bullying victimisation, and child growth failure areGlobal Health Metrics

sparse. For exposure measurement, patterns of data 
availability are non-uniform across geography and over 
time and, where available, might be based on less 
reliable modes of data collection such as self-report. In 
GBD 2019, we implemented more explicit corrections 
for bias associated with non-reference methods of 
exposure measurement that improved the estimation of 
risk exposure. Furthermore, these assessments can be 
used to guide future data collection efforts by identifying 
those populations with not only sparse but low-quality 
data based on the collection mode.
Our analysis, particularly the overall assessment of 
burden attributable to all risks combined and risk-
deleted mortality, is limited by several potentially 
important risk factors not included in this analysis. The 
most important set is likely to be social determinants of 
health such as educational attainment, poverty, or social 
exclusion. We are currently doing systematic reviews on 
educational attainment, which will be the first social 
determinant to be incorporated into future rounds of 
the GBD CRA. There is also a wide range of other 
risk factors not yet included such as nitrous oxide, heavy 
metals, environ­mental noise, sleep, stress, UV radiation, 
among others. Future rounds of GBD might evaluate 
whether these risk factors meet inclusion criteria.
To date, GBD has not included Mendelian ran­
domisation studies in meta-regression. These studies 
could provide new insights on the causal connections 
between risks and outcomes.50 Not all Mendelian 
randomisation studies are appropriate for inclusion.51–53 
Future rounds of GBD will give careful consideration to 
including these studies for some risk–outcome pairs.
For harmful risks with monotonically increasing risk 
functions, we have generally assumed that the TMREL 
is 0. For protective risks such as fruit or whole grain 
intake, selecting the level of exposure that is minimum 
risk is more challenging. Extrapolating the risk function 
beyond where the available cohort studies or trials 
support the protective effect could easily lead to both 
exaggerated estimates of attributable burden and implau­
sible recom­mendations on consumption. To avoid this 
exaggeration, we set the TMREL for protective risks to be 
equal to the 85th percentile of exposure in the available 
cohorts and trials. The 85th percentile is arbitrary, but 
sensitivity analysis did not suggest major changes if we 
selected the 90th or 80th percentiles.
Lastly, in most cases, we assume that relative risks as 
a function of exposure are universal and apply in 
all locations and time periods. Exceptions include 
temperature, in which the risk functions clearly depend 
on the annual mean temperature, and the relative risks 
for high BMI for breast cancer that differ in Asian and 
non-Asian populations. Our rules require that there is 
evidence of significant differences in the relative risk for 
different subgroups; to date, few cases have met this 
standard. As evidence accumulates, more location-
specific or subgroup relative risks might be identified.
Conclusion
Using the most up-to-date assessment of the data for 
exposure and relative risk, we found that global exposure 
to harmful environmental risks has been declining, with 
the notable exception of ambient particulate matter 
pollution. Environ­mental risk reduction is making an 
important contribution to reductions in child mortality. In 
aggregate, there has been no real progress reducing 
exposure to behavioural risks, while metabolic risks are, 
on average, increasing every year. As a world, we are 
failing to change some behaviours, particularly those 
related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity. 
Progress on reducing harm from one crucial behaviour, 
tobacco smoking, shows the power of taxation and 
regulation. The promise of prevention through risk 
modification is not being realised in adult populations 
around the world. Urgent attention on more successful 
strategies to reduce risks is needed.

Meta-analysis of the association between
second-hand smoke exposure and
ischaemic heart diseases, COPD and stroke
Florian Fischer* and Alexander Kraemer
Abstract
Background: Second-hand smoke (SHS) is the most important contaminant of indoor air in first world countries.
The risks associated with SHS exposure are highly relevant, because many people are regularly, and usually
involuntarily, exposed to SHS. This study aims to quantify the effects of SHS exposure. Therefore, its impact on
ischaemic heart diseases (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) and stroke will be considered.
Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify articles dealing with the association between
SHS and the three outcomes IHD, COPD and stroke. Overall, 24 articles were included in a meta-analysis using a
random effects model. Effect sizes stratified for sex and for both sexes combined were calculated.
Results: The synthesis of primary studies revealed significant effect sizes for the association between SHS exposure
and all three outcomes. The highest RR for both sexes combined was found for COPD (RR = 1.66, 95 % CI: 1.38–2.00).
The RR for both sexes combined was 1.35 (95 % CI: 1.22–1.50) for stroke and 1.27 (95 % CI: 1.10–1.48) for IHD. The risks
were higher in women than in men for all three outcomes.
Conclusions: This is the first study to calculate effect sizes for the association between SHS exposure and the disease
outcomes IHD, COPD, and stroke at once. Overall, the effect sizes are comparable with previous findings in
meta-analyses and therefore assumed to be reliable. The results indicate the high relevance of public health
campaigns and legislation to protect non-smokers from the adverse health effects attributable to SHS exposure.
Keywords: Meta-analysis, Second-hand smoke, SHS, Ischaemic heart disease, COPD, Stroke
Background
Second-hand smoke (SHS) still remains the most import-
ant contaminant of indoor air in first world countries [1].
Despite significant reductions within the past decades, a
considerable part of the global population is regularly, and
usually involuntarily, exposed to SHS. Therefore, it is a
highly important risk factor for the total population. SHS
exposure may lead to several chronic conditions, which
are highly relevant in terms of morbidity and mortality for
a population’s health [2]. There is a broad scientific
consensus that SHS exposure is linked to carcinogenesis,
in particular lung cancer. Furthermore, SHS has been
linked to most diseases which are caused by active smok-
ing [3–7]. This association is comprehensible due to the
more than 50 carcinogens that have been identified in
SHS [8].
Several mechanisms may lead to an increased likelihood
of adverse effects in the cardiovascular and respiratory sys-
tem. These mechanisms may cause a reduction in vascular
flow and therefore the development of atherosclerosis
[8, 9]. The mechanisms by which SHS exposure increases
the risk of heart disease are multiple and interact with each
other [10]. In comparison with lung cancer, there is one
important difference in the association between SHS ex-
posure and ischaemic heart diseases (IHD): for lung cancer,
adverse health effects result from long-term exposure,
whereas for other diseases, such as IHD, these effects are
not merely long-term and chronic but also acute [11–15].
The effects of even brief passive smoking are often nearly
as great as (chronic) active smoking [10, 16, 17].

DOI 10.1186/s12889-015-2489-4Evidence of adverse health effects attributable to SHS
exposure
Research focused on the associations between SHS expos-
ure and lung cancer first [18]. But subsequently other out-
comes, such as IHD [19–21], respiratory diseases [22, 23]
and stroke [24–26] were also included in the research. Be-
ginning in 1984, observational studies started to point out
the association between SHS exposure and IHD. This
seems to be the most important outcome attributable to
SHS exposure, because the effects on cardiovascular
diseases are obvious even at low doses of SHS exposure
[19, 27] and because IHDs are much more frequent
than lung disease. Because IHD is so prevalent, even a
small increase in risk associated with SHS exposure will
have a substantial public health impact [28]. Extensive epi-
demiological research spanning a period of 25 years has
indicated that SHS exposure increases the risk of IHD by
25-30 % [2, 10, 17, 19–21, 29], and this was also concluded
by the Institute of Medicine [30]. The effects still remain if
other factors such as dietary intake, socio-economic status,
and health-care use are included in the analysis [31].
Furthermore, a dose–response relationship between
the level of SHS exposure and the occurrence of IHD
was observed [32]. The reported RR of 1.3 (indicating a
30 % excess risk) for the association between SHS exposure
and IHD that has been described in several meta-analyses
[12, 19, 20, 33, 34], is quite large compared to active smok-
ing. The excess risk for regular SHS exposure is about one
third of that smoking 20 cigarettes per day, although the
total exposure to tobacco smoke is only 1 % of that from 20
cigarettes per day [4, 32]. Assuming a linear dose–response
relationship would lead to an expected excess risk asso-
ciated with SHS exposure of only 0.8 % (1 % of the
80 % excess risk from smoking 20 cigarettes per day) [35].
Active smoking is the most important risk factor for
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). Almost
85-90 % of COPD related mortality is attributable to ac-
tive cigarette smoking. However, it is also suggested that
10-15 % of COPD cases are attributable to other risk fac-
tors such as SHS exposure, occupational exposures, and
genetic factors [22, 36]. Since environmental tobacco smoke
contains potent airway irritants, SHS exposure could lead
to chronic airway irritation, inflammation, and obstruction
[37, 38]. Nevertheless, up to now the causal association be-
tween SHS exposure and COPD has received limited atten-
tion in epidemiological studies. The first studies focusing
on the association between SHS exposure and COPD
faced several limitations. First of all, most studies are
based on self-reports and secondly, different methods for
defining COPD were used. Therefore, the reported effects
of passive smoking on lung function are small and par-
tially inconsistent [22, 39–41].
Comparable to COPD, the relationship between SHS
exposure and stroke was not verified for a long time
[8, 42, 43]. In 2014, stroke was included as a condition
that is causally linked to SHS exposure in the Surgeon
General’s Report [44]. After several studies provided over-
all inconsistent results regarding the association between
SHS exposure and stroke [25, 26, 43, 45–48], a meta-
analysis of 20 studies indicated a strong dose-dependent
association between SHS exposure and stroke [49].
Study objective and research question
Tobacco use is one of the most important modifiable
risk factors for several adverse health effects. Neverthe-
less, the effects of SHS exposure on health have not yet
been fully recognized in public health policies [31, 50].
Although several studies have accounted for the (causal)
associations between SHS exposure and disease conditions,
some results are still inconsistent. In order to implement
demand-actuated and successful strategies to protect the
public from adverse health effects attributable to SHS ex-
posure, it is necessary to provide evidence-based informa-
tion about the magnitude and reliability of associations
between SHS exposure and health outcomes. Therefore,
this study aims to quantify the effect sizes of SHS exposure
for three major outcomes: IHD, COPD, and stroke. Based
on the results of a systematic review, a meta-analysis was
performed to summarize the results of single studies in one
effect size for each of the three outcomes. The main goals
of the meta-analysis were: 1) to test whether the study re-
sults are homogeneous and, if so, 2) to obtain a combined
estimator of the effect magnitude for the association be-
tween SHS exposure and the outcomes IHD, COPD and
stroke. Although some meta-analyses have dealt with the
association between SHS exposure and IHD as well as
stroke, this is the first meta-analysis on the association
between SHS exposure and COPD. Furthermore, it is
the first study that allows a comparison of the effects for
the selected outcomes, because the same methodology was
used for the systematic literature review and meta-analysis.
Methods
Systematic literature review
As a first step, a systematic literature review was performed
in PubMed according to the procedure and requirements
described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [51]. The
aim of the systematic review was to identify articles dealing
with the association between SHS and the three outcomes
(IHD, COPD, and stroke). All relevant literature in English
or German language was included without any restrictions
regarding the year of publication. The search was restricted
to studies on the effects of SHS exposure in humans. The
search in PubMed was completed in July 2015. Therefore,
the systematic literature review contained articles published
between 1984 and 2014. The following search algorithm
was performed:

Using the search algorithm under the above-mentioned
filters led to the identification of 403 records. Among
them, 221 were attributable to a combination of the search
terms regarding exposure and the outcome IHD, 178
further articles were attributable to the search terms
on COPD and 47 on stroke.1 After the screening of
title and abstract, 307 of these articles were excluded,
because they did not fit the study’s objective. Therefore, 96
full-texts were assessed for eligibility. According to this
assessment, 71 articles were excluded for the following
reasons2:
 study design
– survey/cross-sectional study (9)
– (systematic) review (28)
– meta-analysis (5)
 no effect sizes provided (24)
 other outcomes observed (5)
 other exposures considered (4)
 letter to the editor (2)
 conflict of interest (1)
A manual search was conducted through the reference
lists of all full-texts, which led to the inclusion of eight
further articles. Finally, 33 articles were included in the
qualitative analysis of the systematic review. Before in-
cluding the studies in the quantitative synthesis in the
form of a meta-analysis, a quality assessment was con-
ducted. This quality assessment, which is described in
more detail in the following section, led to the exclusion
of further 9 studies. The process of the systematic review
is presented in a flow chart (Fig. 1).
Quality assessment
A checklist for the quality assessment was compiled on
the basis of already existing and well-established instru-
ments, such as the PRISMA guidelines [51] and instru-
ments developed for observational studies [52–54]. The
quality score developed for this study consists of three
categories, with four items each. The first category was
introduced to identify a selection bias. Therefore, the se-
lection of cases and response rate are focused here. Since
both case–control and cohort studies were included in the
systematic review, two quality scales were developed
which differed slightly in the aspects regarding recruit-
ment of the study population. The second category deals
with the assessment of misclassification bias. It is asked 1)
whether the exposure evaluation was made in relation to
the time of diagnosis, 2) whether the exposure was vali-
dated by a biomarker, 3) whether specific disease criteria
were provided, and 4) whether the disease was validated
by histology or another gold standard. The third category
focuses on aspects of data analysis. One item was inte-
grated to detect whether or not an adjustment of variables
Fig. 1 Flow chart for study selection
Fischer and Kraemer BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:1202 
Page 3 of 18was performed. Additionally, studies with power calcula-
tions and sufficient sample size scored higher. A sample
size was defined a priori as sufficient if at least 100 subjects
were included in the analysis and a minimum of 20 cases
occurred, in order to exclude studies with low precision.
The last criterion was about the provision of exact p-values
and confidence intervals (CI).
Each item of the quality score answered with “yes” re-
ceived one point, and all items with the labels “uncertain/
not reported” or “no” received no points. All points were
summed which allows a maximum score of 12 points. A
priori, it was decided that all studies with an overall score
of 7 points or lower (n = 9) would be excluded from the
meta-analysis.
Calculation of relative risks
To allow for comparability between the results of the sin-
gle studies, those results in which regular SHS exposure
was investigated were focused upon. The definition of
regular exposure varied between studies. Most commonly,
spousal smoking or being exposed to about 20 cigarettes
or more per day was interpreted as regular SHS exposure.
In case studies divided between SHS exposure at home or
at work, only the results for exposure at home were
chosen. Nevertheless, several studies only provided infor-
mation for SHS exposure at home and work combined.
The RR from the cohort studies were directly trans-
ferred to the summary of studies presented in Table 1.
For case–control studies RR had to be derived from the
provided odds ratios (OR). This was done for reasons of
comparability of the results and because a single meas-
urement unit was needed for the meta-analysis. For the
calculation of RR based on OR an approach introduced
by Barendregt [55] was selected. This approach describes
the OR as a function of the RR, the average risk of dis-
ease in the population (s), and the prevalence of the risk
factor (p). The equation uses the assumptions of the
common definitions of RR and OR, and the observation
that the average risk of a disease in any population is a
linear combination of the risk in the exposed and non-
exposed sub-populations:
OR ¼
RR⋅1−
s
p⋅RR þ 1 −p


1−
RR⋅s
p⋅RR þ 1 −p
The reciprocal conversion from OR to RR requires a nu-
merical optimization procedure. The detailed derivation
of the equation and the Excel add-in for the calculation of
RR is provided by Barendregt [55].
Meta-analysis
The provided or calculated RRs from the primary studies
with high methodological quality were used for the
meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted in MIX
2.0 Pro, which is a statistical add-in to perform meta-
analysis with Microsoft Excel [56]. As a first step, the
RRs and CIs from all the studies were converted into the
logarithm function of the RR (log (rr)) and standard er-
rors (se). This information, including the sample size,
was used to calculate effect sizes for each of the three
outcomes, stratified by sex. The precision was set to an
alpha-level of 0.05 and a z-distribution as the standard
distribution was chosen. For the analysis, a generic
inverse-variance method random effects model was
chosen, to provide estimates for the association between
SHS exposure and the outcomes IHD, COPD and stroke.
In this model, weight is given to each study according to
the inverse variance of the effect, to minimize uncer-
tainty about the summarized effect estimates, according
to the widely used approach developed by DerSimonian
and Laird [57].
Statistical analysis
The random effects model was chosen, because the data
were expected to be heterogeneous across studies. The
advantage of a random effects model is that it incorpo-
rates variation in the underlying effect sizes between
studies. It is assumed that each single study has its own
(true) effect and that there is a random distribution of
these effects around a central effect [58]. In contrast,
using a fixed effect model under conditions of hetero-
geneity, the CI for the overall effects reflects the random
variation within each study, but not the potential hetero-
geneity across studies, which would lead to artificially
narrow CIs [59]. Furthermore, random effects models
are more sensitive to publication bias, due to the larger
relative weight given to smaller studies. This implies that
a random effects model may still be worth considering
as it cannot be assumed that true homogeneity exists
across the studies [60].
In order to consider the sensitivity of results, potential
publication and study bias were assessed visually using a
heterogeneity funnel plot (see Additional file 1). Addition-
ally, heterogeneity was quantified using two statistical
measures: The Q- and I2-statistics reflect a certain dimen-
sion of the extent of heterogeneity between the studies.
The Q-statistic is the sum of the weighted squared differ-
ences between each individual study’s estimate and the
overall (inverse variance)
summary
estimates.
This
statistic follows a χ2-distribution with k–1 degrees of
freedom, under the null-hypothesis of homogeneity. The
Q-test is defined by Hedges and Olkin [61] as:

Page 8 of 18studies and T is the estimate of the mean effect size,
which consists of weighting every effect estimate Ti by
its inverse variance. A p-value < 0.1 for the Q-statistic in-
dicates heterogeneity [61].
Afterwards, the I2 is derived from the Q-statistic. The
I2-index measures the extent of true heterogeneity by
dividing the difference between the results of the Q test
and its degrees of freedom by the Q-value itself, and
multiplying by 100:
I2 ¼ Q−k−1
ð
Þ
Q
⋅100
The I2-index quantifies the proportion of inconsistency
among the study results. It is commonly expressed as a
percentage and is therefore interpreted as the percentage
of the total variability in a set of effect sizes due to be-
tween-study variation that is not attributable to random
sampling from a fixed parameter [62]. Higgins and
Thompson [62] proposed a tentative classification of I2-
values to help in the interpretation of the heterogeneity’s
magnitude: according to this classification, percentages of
around 25 %, 50 % and 75 % would mean low, medium,
and high heterogeneity, respectively.
Results
Studies of SHS exposure and selected outcomes
Overall, 33 studies were included in the systematic re-
view. The first article was published in 1988, and the
most recent in 2013. Several of the articles provided
information on more than one outcome. Most articles
described the effect of SHS exposure on IHD (n = 20).
In 12 articles stroke was investigated as an outcome
and eight articles focused on COPD (Table 1).
The spatial distribution of the study locations of all
studies identified by the systematic review is quite equal:
nine studies were performed in Asia (mainly in China
and Hong Kong), Europe (mainly in Great Britain and
northern European countries), and the USA. A further
five studies were located in Australia and/or New Zealand
and one in South America. Half of the articles described
the results of a case–control study (n = 17) and the other
half used a cohort design (n = 16). In almost all studies,
information on SHS exposure was based on self-reporting
(n = 30), while two studies performed a cotinine assess-
ment for measuring SHS exposure and one study used a
combination of self-reporting and cotinine assessment
(Table 1). Usually, never-smokers or non-smokers were
studied. However, some studies did not provide any infor-
mation on the smoking status of subjects or included
active smokers as well as non-smokers. In these cases,
smoking status was controlled for in the analyses. All but
two studies [63, 64] controlled for several factors.
The study samples varied between 309 599 never-
smokers in a cohort study in the USA, dealing with the
association between SHS exposure and IHD [65] and a
case–control study with 56 female IHD patients and 136
female controls in China [66].
Effect sizes for SHS exposure and selected outcomes
SHS and ischaemic heart disease
The RR for the single studies dealing with the association
between SHS and IHD are presented in Table 2. From the
20 studies on IHD in the systematic review, five were ex-
cluded because of low methodological quality according to
the quality assessment. Additionally, the Greek study from
Panagiotakos et al. [67] was excluded in the meta-analysis,
because the same data was used in the study by Pitsavos
et al. [50], in which the analysis was stratified by place of
exposure. This led to 14 studies on the effects of SHS ex-
posure on IHD. In 6 of these studies, information summa-
rized for both sexes were provided (n = 24 903). The RR
for the association between SHS and IHD was either
stratified by sex or only observed for one sex in six studies
for men (n = 8208) and nine for women (n = 111 533).
The synthesis of all the studies included in the meta-
analysis results in a RR of 1.27 (95 % CI: 1.10 – 1.48) for
both sexes together. The RR was much higher for
women (RR = 1.50, 95 % CI: 1.31 – 1.72) than for men
(RR = 1.06, 95 % CI: 0.96 – 1.19). None of the studies
showed significant results for men regarding the associ-
ation between SHS exposure and IHD.
The studies from McGhee et al. [24], Pitsavos et al.
[50] and Rosenlund et al. [68] had the highest impact on
the synthesis, because these three studies were weighted
with 88 % overall. The results of Ciruzzi et al. [69], with
a very broad confidence interval (RR = 2.04, 95 % CI:
0.99–12.52), contributed only to a small extent to the
overall RR due to the weighting factor of 1.39 %. For
men, the study by McElduff et al. [70] contributed most
to the synthesis result (46.59 %). For women, several
studies contributed to more or less the same extent to
the synthesis (Table 2, Fig. 2).
Cochran’s Q-test revealed no heterogeneity, because
the p-value was larger than 0.1 for all three subgroup
syntheses. This is confirmed by the I2-statistic, which
quantifies the assumption between the three different
subgroup syntheses. According to the results of these
tests, no heterogeneity was observed for men (I2 = 0 %),
and only a small but negligible heterogeneity for the
studies focusing on women (I2 = 16.00 %). I2 was highest
for studies including both sexes (I2 = 30.78 %), because the
RR obviously differed for men and women (Table 2).
SHS and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Only five studies investigating the association between SHS
exposure and COPD were included in the meta-analysis,
Fischer and Kraemer BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:1202 
Page 9 of 18after three further studies were excluded because of low
quality. Overall, 28 965 participants were included in these
studies, with more than half of them (n = 15 379) being in-
vestigated in one Chinese cohort study [71]. In three studies
the RRs for the association between SHS and COPD were
calculated for both sexes combined (n = 21,558). Only
McGhee et al. [24] provided information stratified for men
(n = 3,098) and women (n = 2,503) and two further studies
investigated the association between SHS and COPD in a
female-only study population (Table 3).
The large study by Yin et al. [71] accounted for almost
half (49.49 %) of the weighting factor for both sexes.
Two further studies, by Chan-Yeung et al. [72] and
McGhee et al. [24], accounted for 25 % each for the
weighting factor in the subgroup of both sexes. For the
female subgroup, the weighting factors were distributed
in a similar way for the three studies included, although
based on different studies.
The synthesis for both sexes is based on three studies
with consistent and significant results. A RR of 1.66
with a comparatively small confidence interval (95 %
CI: 1.38–2.00) was calculated. Since the synthesis for
men is based on only one study, the RR of 1.50 (95 %
CI: 0.96–2.28) was inherited. For women, a higher RR
was identified (RR = 2.17, 95 % CI: 1.48–3.18) than for
men (Table 3, Fig. 3).
The heterogeneity between studies was assessed for
the subgroups of both sexes and for women. The Q-
statistic and its p-value suggested no heterogeneity be-
tween study results. The I2 for both sexes was 0 % and
for women it was 22.95 %, which indicates no or only
small heterogeneity (Table 3).
SHS and stroke
The results for stroke are based on seven studies, after
five studies were excluded due to the quality assessment.
Five studies provided information combined for both sexes
(n = 52,263). In four studies the analysis was stratified for
sex. This leads overall to 22 905 male study participants.
Two large additional studies focused only on women, which
leads overall to 162 197 female study participants, which
allows for investigating the association between SHS

Page 10 of 18exposure and stroke. For the synthesis of all three sub-
groups, the study performed by McGhee et al. [24] is of
particular importance due to its high weighting factor
(Table 4).
The synthesis for the three stroke subgroups differs
from the two outcomes for IHD and COPD described
above. In this case, the RR for the association between SHS
and stroke is 1.35 (95 % CI: 1.22 – 1.50) for both sexes
combined. The analysis separated for sex led to a slightly
higher RR for men (RR = 1.40, 95 % CI: 1.09–1.81) as well
as for women (RR = 1.43, 95 % CI: 1.28–1.61) compared to
the synthesis for both sexes (Table 4, Fig. 4). This is due to
the fact that the studies included in the meta-analysis in
which both sexes are considered in a combined effect size
are not exclusively the same as those which show results
for men or women separately. One study only gives results
Fig. 2 Forest plot–SHS and ischaemic heart disease
Fischer and Kraemer BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:1202 
Page 11 of 18for both sexes combined [25] and two studies only give
results for women [73, 74].
The Q-statistic indicated no heterogeneity, although
the p-value for the Q-statistic for men was 0.184 and
therefore close to the border indicating heterogeneity.
According to the I2, the studies for women (I2 = 0 %) as
well as for both sexes (I2 = 2.08 %) are homogeneous.
For men, a low to medium heterogeneity was observed

In this study, the effect sizes for IHD, COPD and stroke
attributable to SHS exposure were estimated. For all
three outcomes, the effect sizes were larger for women

Page 12 of 18than for men. In men, statistically significant results
were revealed only for the association between SHS ex-
posure and stroke. According to the calculated effect
sizes for all three disease entities, the risk factor of SHS
exposure seems to be particularly important for COPD.
A 66 % excess risk of COPD was calculated for people
exposed to SHS for both sexes combined. For stroke
(RR = 1.35, 95 % CI: 1.22–1.50) and IHD (RR = 1.27,
95 % CI: 1.10–1.48), the RR was considerably lower.
IHD
The calculated association between SHS exposure and
IHD is consistent with several meta-analyses calculating
the overall RR of coronary heart diseases associated with
SHS exposure among non-smokers. In a meta-analysis
including 18 studies (10 prospective cohort studies and
eight case–control studies), the estimated RR was 1.25
(95 % CI: 1.17–1.32) [20]. A meta-analysis by Wells [12]
focused on the association between IHD mortality and
SHS exposure. According to this study, a RR of 1.23
(95 % CI: 1.12–1.35) was calculated for both sexes
combined (men: RR = 1.25, 95 % CI: 1.03–1.51; women:
RR = 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.11–1.36) [12]. These estimations are
comparable to the calculation of the effect size for both
sexes combined. Nevertheless, the study by Wells [12]
provided effect sizes which are almost equal for both
sexes. In our study the results for the association between
SHS exposure and IHD indicated much higher effect sizes
for women. Wells [12] also calculated the effect size as-
sociating IHD morbidity with SHS exposure. Here, the
RR for women was 1.51 (95 % CI: 1.16–1.97), which is
comparable to the estimation of the results of our
study. Therefore, it seems that the associations for IHD
morbidity and mortality differ substantially, and this
leads to differences in the effect sizes estimated in this
study compared to previous ones.
COPD
The estimation of the effect size for the association be-
tween SHS exposure and COPD cannot be compared to
other meta-analyses, because this is the first attempt to
calculate a synthesis for the primary studies dealing with
this association. Up to now, the number of studies on
SHS exposure as a risk factor for adult onset COPD is
small compared with the number on the adverse health
effects of SHS exposure on childhood respiratory symp-
toms and diseases [22]. The estimation for both sexes
combined led to a RR of 1.66 (95 % CI: 1.38–2.00),
which is higher than the estimation for the association
between SHS exposure and IHD. This also applies to the
gender stratified estimations: in women a RR of 2.17
was calculated with a fairly broad confidence interval
(95 % CI: 1.48–3.18). This can be explained by the
fact that three of the total of five studies dealt with
the association in women. The studies by Wu et al. [75]
(RR = 3.12, 95 % CI: 1.56–6.50) and McGhee et al. [24]

Page 13 of 18(RR = 2.59, 95 % CI: 1.30–5.27) in particular contributed
to the broad confidence interval. Therefore, the few exist-
ing studies on SHS exposure and COPD differ consider-
ably, although the results indicate a positive association.
No judgement on the consistency of the results of primary
studies on the association between SHS exposure and
COPD for men is possible, because only the study by
McGhee et al. [24] provided results for the male subgroup
(RR = 1.50, 95 % CI: 0.96–2.28).
Stroke
The estimations for the association between SHS exposure
and stroke (RR = 1.35, 95 % CI: 1.22–1.50) are comparable
with previous meta-analyses. In our study, the effect sizes
showed a significantly increased risk for people exposed to
SHS in both sexes, with RRs that are almost equal between
men (RR = 1.40, 95 % CI: 1.09–1.81) and women (RR–
1.43, 95 % CI: 1.28–1.61). Lee and Forey [76] provided
a comprehensive review of epidemiological evidence
relating stroke to SHS exposure in lifelong non-smokers.
Overall, including 16 studies (seven prospective cohort
studies, six case–control studies and three cross-sectional
studies) which used current spousal smoking (or nearest
equivalent) as the exposure index led to an overall estimate
of 1.25 (95 % CI: 1.16–1.36), which is slightly lower than
our calculations. The study results also indicated no signifi-
cant heterogeneity and no differences between men and
women [76], which is consistent with our study results.
Eight studies in the meta-analysis provided information
regarding a possible dose–response relationship between
Fig. 4 Forest plot–SHS and stroke
Fischer and Kraemer BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:1202 
Page 14 of 18SHS exposure and stroke. According to this, the synthesis
for the highest level of exposure led to a RR of 1.56 (95 %
CI: 1.34–1.82).
Another meta-analysis [49], included 20 studies (10
cohort studies, six case–control studies and four cross-
sectional studies) published between 1984 and 2010. All
of these reported results for non-smokers, who were
mainly defined as never-smokers, although some studies
also included ex-smokers or infrequent current smokers.
Eleven studies in the meta-analysis by Oono et al. [49]
measured the dose of SHS exposure, which was either
defined as the number of smokers, cigarettes per day,
hours per week, pack years, or cotinine concentration
and score. Our calculations for the effect size of the
increased risk of stroke attributable to SHS exposure
(RR = 1.35, 95 % CI: 1.22–1.50) are in line with the re-
sults of SHS exposure of either 10 cigarettes per day
(RR = 1.31, 95 % CI: 1.12–1.54) or 15 cigarettes per day
(RR = 1.45, 95 % CI: 1.19–1.78) [49].
Dose–response relationship
The results of the primary studies that were included in the
meta-analysis on the associations between SHS exposure
and IHD as well as stroke indicate a distinct dose–response
relationship. Even low levels of SHS exposure increase
the risk of adverse health effects, indicating that there
is no safe level of exposure [42, 49]. The effects of SHS
exposure are lower than those of active smoking, but it
has been consistently shown that the effects of SHS ex-
posure on the cardiovascular system are much larger
than might be expected from a comparison of the doses
of toxins delivered to active and passive smokers. Therefore
the effects of SHS are estimated to be on average 80-90 %
as harmful as those of active smoking [10]. The effects of a
dose–response relationship between SHS exposure and ad-
verse health outcomes were not depicted in this study, be-
cause it focused on regular exposure to SHS. Although the
dose–response function might supply important additional
information, Sauerbrei et al. [77] argued that aggregated
data are too limited to perform a meta-analysis including a
dose–response analysis. Nevertheless, regular SHS expos-
ure, irrespective of the dose is still an important risk factor,
because it may lead to both acute and chronic diseases.
Gender differences
The stratification for sex performed in this study is highly
relevant, because the effect sizes as well as the prevalence
of diseases and the prevalence of SHS exposure differ be-
tween the sexes. Until now, it has been largely men who
have been considered in many studies dealing with IHD,
because of their higher prevalence of coronary diseases. In
most parts of the world women are at least 50 % more
likely to be exposed to SHS than men [78]. Until now,
only a few studies have investigated possible mechanisms
underlying sex differences in adverse health outcomes
such as IHD related to SHS exposure. It is assumed
that the anti-oestrogenic effect of cigarette smoking–and
therefore also the exposure to SHS–may be at least partly
related to the increased risk of IHD in young females
smokers [79]. Furthermore, a study by Geisler et al. [80]
indicated that in smoking women undergoing oestrogen
replacement therapy, plasma levels of oestrogen were
40-70 % lower than in non-smoking women. Additionally,
a decrease in both oestradiol and testosterone concentra-
tions in smoking men has been reported [81]. Therefore,
hormonal factors seem to considerably influence vulner-
ability due to SHS exposure. This might be one explanation
for gender differences in the effects of SHS exposure [82].
Limitations
There are methodological restrictions in data quality
of primary studies, which have to be considered when
interpreting the results. Among these, particularly the
differences in study designs and misclassification bias
due to different definitions and measurements of SHS
exposure have to be mentioned. Another limitation of
major importance in the context of a systematic litera-
ture review is a possible publication bias, although a
review of published and unpublished studies on the
health effects of SHS exposure showed no evidence of
publication bias against statistically non-significant results
in the peer-reviewed literature [83].
Another limitation in the identification of primary stud-
ies on the association between SHS exposure and the
three selected diseases leads back to the decision to per-
form the systematic literature search only in one literature
database, PubMed. Therefore, some studies might have
been missed, although an additional manual search in the
reference lists of publications was performed, which led to
only eight further articles. A broader search strategy with
another search algorithm may have led to further articles
eligible for the meta-analysis.
The quality assessment led to the exclusion of nine stud-
ies. Although the development of criteria for the quality
assessment was based on established instruments, differ-
ent criteria may have led to the exclusion of more or fewer
articles, depending on their strictness. The quality check-
list was used as a scale, although the criticism has been
made that these scales do not provide a transparent esti-
mation of the degree of bias [84]. Furthermore, quality
scores neglect information about individual items and no
empirical basis for the different weights that are implicitly
given to each item exists [85]. Nevertheless, this approach
was chosen, to allow for the exclusion of studies with low
methodological quality.
Since only cohort studies and case–control studies were
selected, a large number of studies had to be excluded ei-
ther during the screening of titles and abstracts or during
Fischer and Kraemer BMC Public Health  (2015) 15:1202 
Page 15 of 18the assessment of full-texts. Also, comparatively small
studies with low effect sizes or rather broad confidence in-
tervals were included in the meta-analysis. These studies
carried a smaller weight in the synthesis of results. To
make the results of the primary studies comparable, all the
OR provided in case–control studies were re-calculated
into RR using quite a conservative approach, which is
more likely to underestimate the true association. There-
fore, overall, the effect sizes calculated in the meta-analysis
represent a conservative estimate.
Besides the identification and data quality of primary
studies, the combination of research results from mul-
tiple studies performed in the meta-analysis faces several
limitations and uncertainties. Although this meta-analysis
indicates only low heterogeneity, diversity between studies,
for example due to different populations (e.g., countries,
age groups), inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., more se-
vere patients), study designs (e.g., inadequate follow-up of
lost patients), statistical methods used, and various sources
of bias, is still an important issue. Formal heterogeneity
tests face low statistical power. In this study, the Q-
statistic and I2-test were used. A shortcoming of the
Q-statistic is that it has low power to detect true heterogen-
eity among studies when the meta-analysis includes only a
small number of studies [86]. The Q-statistic is useful to
test for the existence of heterogeneity, but not to assess the
magnitude of heterogeneity. For that we used the I2.
For the calculation of the effect sizes for COPD, it has
to be kept in mind that the estimation for men is based
on only one study. Particularly for COPD, the synthesis
is based on very few studies, which limits its reliability.
The combination of studies will often result in small
confidence intervals, suggesting a false precision [58]. In
this context, it is relevant to point out that random ef-
fects models, as used in this study, are not sufficient
to explain the heterogeneity between studies, since the
random effect merely quantifies an unexplained variation
by estimating it [59].
Conclusion and implications
Up to now, the effects of SHS exposure on population
health are still controversial, although several studies and
meta-analyses have revealed comparable results on the as-
sociation between regular SHS exposure and adverse health
outcomes. However, further studies with sound methodo-
logical approaches due to large prospective epidemiological
studies using biomarkers for exposure assessment are still
required to determine the risks associated with SHS expos-
ure [16, 76]. Furthermore, there is only a little evidence for
the effects of SHS on health-related quality of life, which is
a very important parameter for well-being besides objective
parameters such as morbidity and mortality.
To address this research need, this study was conducted.
It is the first study to have calculated effect sizes for the
association between SHS exposure and the disease out-
comes IHD, COPD, and stroke, stratified by sex. The effect
sizes calculated in the meta-analysis are overall compar-
able with previous findings in meta-analyses for IHD and
stroke. This suggests that the results are reliable. Al-
though no previous meta-analysis for the association
between SHS exposure and COPD is available, the re-
sults are assumed to be reliable as well, because the
methodological approach in this study was the same for
all three disease entities. Nevertheless, further research
is needed, to provide more adequate primary studies
which account for confounding and other biases.

Association of residential dampness and mold
with respiratory tract infections and bronchitis:
a meta-analysis
William J Fisk*†, Ekaterina A Eliseeva†, Mark J Mendell†
Abstract
Background: Dampness and mold have been shown in qualitative reviews to be associated with a variety of
adverse respiratory health effects, including respiratory tract infections. Several published meta-analyses have
provided quantitative summaries for some of these associations, but not for respiratory infections. Demonstrating a
causal relationship between dampness-related agents, which are preventable exposures, and respiratory tract
infections would suggest important new public health strategies. We report the results of quantitative meta-
analyses of published studies that examined the association of dampness or mold in homes with respiratory
infections and bronchitis.
Methods: For primary studies meeting eligibility criteria, we transformed reported odds ratios (ORs) and
confidence intervals (CIs) to the log scale. Both fixed and random effects models were applied to the log ORs and
their variances. Most studies contained multiple estimated ORs. Models accounted for the correlation between
multiple results within the studies analyzed. One set of analyses was performed with all eligible studies, and
another set restricted to studies that controlled for age, gender, smoking, and socioeconomic status. Subgroups of
studies were assessed to explore heterogeneity. Funnel plots were used to assess publication bias.
Results: The resulting summary estimates of ORs from random effects models based on all studies ranged from
1.38 to 1.50, with 95% CIs excluding the null in all cases. Use of different analysis models and restricting analyses
based on control of multiple confounding variables changed findings only slightly. ORs (95% CIs) from random
effects models using studies adjusting for major confounding variables were, for bronchitis, 1.45 (1.32-1.59); for
respiratory infections, 1.44 (1.31-1.59); for respiratory infections excluding nonspecific upper respiratory infections,
1.50 (1.32-1.70), and for respiratory infections in children or infants, 1.48 (1.33-1.65). Little effect of publication bias
was evident. Estimated attributable risk proportions ranged from 8% to 20%.
Conclusions: Residential dampness and mold are associated with substantial and statistically significant increases
in both respiratory infections and bronchitis. If these associations were confirmed as causal, effective control of
dampness and mold in buildings would prevent a substantial proportion of respiratory infections.
Background
Dampness and mold in buildings have been associated
in many studies with adverse respiratory health effects.
A number of qualitative summaries of this literature are
available [1-3]. In their review, the Institute of Medicine
(IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences found
sufficient evidence to document an association between
qualitatively assessed indoor dampness or mold and
upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, wheeze, and
asthma symptoms in sensitized persons [2]. A later
review by the World Health Organization (WHO),
including additional studies, expanded the documented
associations to include asthma development, current
asthma, dyspnea, and respiratory infections. While both
reviews concluded that excessive indoor dampness was
an important public health problem meriting prevention
and remediation, neither review produced quantitative

and specific health outcomes.
Two prior quantitative meta-analyses have been pub-
lished on indoor dampness and mold and selected
health effects. In 2007, Fisk et al. [4] quantitatively sum-
marized the associations of home dampness and mold
with a set of respiratory and asthma-related health
effects, based on available studies published in peer-
reviewed journals in English [4]. Health outcomes
included were upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough,
wheeze, asthma diagnosis ever, current asthma, and
asthma development. The meta-analyses produced cen-
tral estimates of ORs ranging from 1.34 to 1.75 for
these health outcomes, with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) excluding the null in nine of ten instances. Antova
et al. [5] analyzed pooled data from 12 European cross-
sectional studies of visible mold in residences and
respiratory or allergic health outcomes of children. Out-
comes included bronchitis, wheeze, asthma, nocturnal
dry cough, morning cough, sensitivity to inhaled aller-
gens, hay fever, and “woken by wheeze.” Central esti-
mates of ORs ranged from 1.30 to 1.50, with all 95% CIs
excluding the null.
Thus while prior non-quantitative reviews have
reported consistent associations between dampness or
mold and respiratory infections, no quantitative meta-
analysis of this relationship has been reported. A sub-
stantial number of epidemiologic studies on dampness
or mold and respiratory infections are available for this
purpose.
Respiratory (tract) infections are generally considered
to include infections of the lower and upper respiratory
tract, and otitis media. Lower respiratory tract infections
include pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and acute exacer-
bation of chronic bronchitis. While acute bronchitis is
generally caused by an infection, chronic bronchitis is
generally non-infectious in origin. Upper respiratory
tract infections are acute infections of the nose, sinuses,
and throat. Otitis media, an infection or inflammation
of the middle ear often resulting from a prior upper
respiratory tract infection, can be bacterial or viral in
origin.
The burden of morbidity and mortality and the finan-
cial costs of respiratory tract infections are enormous.
Little effective prevention is currently possible outside of
two strategies: attempting to avoid contact with or
spreading of infectious agents in aerosols, droplets, or
surfaces, such as by hand washing, avoiding infected
individuals, avoiding face-touching, and covering
sneezes; and vaccination for influenza and pneumococ-
cal pneumonia. It is important to determine whether
avoidance of dampness and mold can provide another
means of reducing respiratory tract infection. As a
step toward that goal, we performed a quantitative
meta-analysis to summarize findings in the peer-
reviewed medical literature on associations between
dampness or mold in residences and respiratory tract
infections or bronchitis.
Methods
Our search for published articles involved several strate-
gies (see details in Additional File 1, Appendix 1): an
online search of PubMed, an online search of the jour-
nal Indoor Air, and a manual search of the reference list
in the publication “World Health Organization Guide-
lines on Dampness, Mold, and Health” [3].
Papers meeting all of the following criteria were
selected for use in the meta-analyses:
1) published in a refereed archival journal in English.
2) based on original data; i.e., not a review article or
meta-analysis.
3) reported effect estimates as odds ratios (ORs) or
risk ratios (RRs), with confidence intervals (CIs) esti-
mated from statistical analyses.
4) included as risk factors qualitatively assessed
dampness, mold, or dampness and mold in resi-
dences, whether in detached homes or multifamily
housing (dormitory rooms were accepted as homes)
5) included one or more of the health outcomes
listed in Table 1 (see below).
6) included at least ten buildings, if building-level
exposures were used.
We performed one set of analyses including only
results from studies that controlled for potential con-
founding by the following factors via study design or
analysis method: age, gender, smoking (e.g., active smok-
ing, smoking in home, smoking by mother during preg-
nancy), and some measure of socioeconomic status
(SES). We considered studies with populations limited
to home owners, university students, or university
employees as adequately controlled for SES. We also
considered the reporting of no significant association
between an outcome and a potential confounder as
equivalent to controlling for that confounder. In another
set of unrestricted analyses, we did not require control
for these potential sources of confounding, although
most of the added studies controlled for all but one of
these factors.
For papers which reported strength of association as
RRs instead of ORs, we included RRs as if they were
ORs for the primary analysis. RRs approximate ORs well
when outcome prevalence is low; however, we also per-
formed an analysis excluding RR values.
Ideally, a meta-analysis would utilize input data only
from studies with the same precisely defined risk factor,
health outcome, and population. As this was not
Fisk et al. Environmental Health 2010, 9:72
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9/1/72
Page 2 of 11possible, we used input data from studies that were as
similar as practicable, all in residences. The following
risk factors were accepted: dampness, water damage,
visible mold, mold odor, or flooding - all in the whole
home, main living area, or bedroom. We did not distin-
guish among dampness, mold, dampness or mold,
and dampness and mold as risk factors. Our rationale -
visible mold is always considered the result of excess
dampness whether or not the dampness is reported, and
excess dampness is very often accompanied by mold,
although the mold may not be visible. Thus, it was not
possible to make a clear distinction among these risk
factors. Excluded as inputs were ORs for condensation
(a less certain indication of potential microbial contami-
nation), ORs per unit area of visible mold or water
damage, ORs for “suspected moisture problem,” and
ORs for higher measured airborne concentrations of
molds, bacteria, ergosterol, glucan, or endotoxin. The
included studies had either adults or children as sub-
jects. Presence of dampness and/or mold was deter-
mined in each study by either the occupants or the
researchers. We did not distinguish between occupant-
reported dampness and/or mold and researcher-
reported dampness and/or mold.
The categories of health outcomes constructed for
meta-analyses were respiratory infection group, respira-
tory infection group excluding otitis media, and bron-
chitis (acute, chronic, or not clearly characterized as
acute or chronic). The respiratory infection group out-
comes involved viral or bacterial infections; we excluded
from consideration respiratory infections by fungi which
occur primarily in people with compromised immune
systems. The respiratory infection and bronchitis out-
come categories overlap, with some studies of respira-
tory infections including bronchitis or episodes of
bronchitis within their definition of a respiratory infec-
tion. We included separate bronchitis outcomes in the
respiratory infection group only if the definition stated
or suggested acute bronchitis. The category of bronchitis
includes acute bronchitis, normally the result of an
acute respiratory infection, and chronic bronchitis,
which may be unrelated to an infection. Most papers
did not provide sufficient information to allow classifica-
tion of the bronchitis as acute or chronic.
For respiratory infections, we also produced summary
estimates separately for studies of children and of adults
(omitting the one study that included both). In addition,
we produced a summary estimate for the respiratory
infections group after excluding findings for a set of
relatively nonspecific upper respiratory outcomes that
seemed most susceptible to inclusion of allergic or irri-
tant symptoms. This excluded findings such as for com-
mon cold, chest cold with wheeze, acute upper
respiratory infections, acute respiratory tract infections,
respiratory infections, and airway infections. We did not
exclude throat infections, sinusitis, tonsillitis, otitis, or
the various lower respiratory infections.
We applied random effects models [6] to derive cen-
tral estimates and confidence limits for associations of
the health outcomes with dampness and mold as
reported by the multiple published studies which varied
in symptom definitions, subjects, and locations. The
approach used was the same as in a prior meta-analysis
of dampness and mold with respiratory and asthma out-
comes [4]. In each meta-analysis model, we included
multiple ORs from single studies that reported more
than one OR for different but correlated risk factors (e.
g., visible mold; dampness), different health outcomes
(e.g., respiratory infection, common cold), or both; e.g.,
ORs in one study for visible mold with bronchitis,

infections, and dampness with respiratory infections.
Random effects models adjusting for possible within-
study correlations were used in our primary analyses. In
addition, we used the procedure PROC MIXED in SAS
(ver 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), which allows fix-
ing the within-study variances (matrix R in SAS) while
estimating between-study variance (matrix G in SAS).
ORs and 95% CIs reported in each reviewed study
were first transformed to the log scale. The transformed
results for each outcome category were then combined
using a random effects model. The model accounting
for the correlation between multiple results within stu-
dies was

where:

s*2 is the between-study variance; and
ij

log CI.
Results based on the model described above were
compared to those obtained from secondary analyses
using fixed effects models that assumed independence
of multiple ORs within individual studies. Additional
models were constructed that omitted the reported RR
values. For final models, we assessed heterogeneity of
study-specific effect estimates using the meta command
in STATA to estimate the Q statistic and associated
p-value. Where the p-value for heterogeneity was <0.05
for both the full and restricted sets of findings, we
further explored possible sources of heterogeneity by
conducting sensitivity tests, and performing tests of het-
erogeneity for various subsets of findings, as feasible.
Funnel plots were produced to check for evidence of
publication bias. If the plot for an outcome showed asym-
metry only among less precise (generally smaller) studies,
suggesting that smaller studies without positive findings
were less likely to have been published, then an alternate
analysis was performed. This excluded the set of smaller
studies exhibiting asymmetry, in order to produce pre-
sumably less biased summary estimates based only on
the more completely reported, more precise studies.
Results
Overall, 23 studies were selected for inclusion in these
meta-analyses. Table 1 provides the number of studies
for each health outcome category and the specific out-
comes from reviewed studies included in each category.
Table 2 identifies the studies in each health outcome
category. It was not possible to summarize findings for
acute bronchitis separately, as too few studies reported
findings for an outcome clearly restricted to acute or
infectious bronchitis.
Major results from the meta-analyses of all eligible
studies, regardless of control for confounding, are pro-
vided in column 2 of Table 3. For the two primary out-
comes, bronchitis and respiratory infections, central
estimates of ORs were 1.44 and 1.45. For these and all
other subcategories in Table 3, 95% CIs excluded the
null. P-values for heterogeneity for both were <0.0001.
For bronchitis and the respiratory infection group, cen-
tral estimates changed little (by less than 0.01) when the
models were restricted to studies that controlled for age,
gender, smoking, and socioeconomic status (column 3);
however, with this restriction the p-value for heteroge-
neity for bronchitis increased to 0.12. Estimates (not
shown) derived from fixed effects models were also very
similar to the estimates in Table 1 - the maximum
change in central estimate OR was 0.04. For the respira-
tory infection group, excluding RR values reported by
two studies [7,8] changed the central estimate by
less than 0.01 and confidence interval endpoints by 0.03
or less.
A series of models excluding each finding sequentially
did not identify highly influential single findings. The
two most extreme findings (ORs of 0.48 [9] and 5.1
[10]) were not from large studies, and did not have
major influence. Additional models were constructed
with specific subgroups of respiratory infection out-
comes (Table 3). For these subgroups, when restricted
to studies with control of at least the four key con-
founding factors, modeling outcomes of respiratory
infections excluding otitis media did not much change
the estimate or decrease heterogeneity. Modeling out-
comes of respiratory infections excluding common cold
and nonspecific upper respiratory infections increased
the central estimate to 1.50 and decreased heterogeneity
(p = 0.07). Restricting the model to only common cold
or acute upper respiratory infection (excluding several
findings of unspecified respiratory infections), the cen-
tral estimate was 1.38, but with high heterogeneity. Con-
structing separate overall respiratory infection group
models for children/infants and for adults led to similar
ORs of 1.48 and 1.49, with decreased heterogeneity (p =
0.09) only for children/infants. Other study factors
potentially contributing to heterogeneity included statis-
tical adjustment for subject atopy, parental atopy, or
presence of furry pets, and whether assessment of envir-
onmental dampness was conducted by researchers or
participants. Numbers in these subgroups were small,

to influence heterogeneity.
Figure 1 shows forest plots with adjusted ORs and
95% CIs for the associations of respiratory infections
and bronchitis with dampness and mold as reported in
the original studies. Figure 1 also shows the summary
estimates produced in the meta-analyses using random
effects models with all studies listed in Table 2.
Funnel plots for the respiratory infection group and
bronchitis are shown in Figure 2. No asymmetry was
evident for bronchitis. The asymmetry in data points for
the respiratory infection group, i.e., the absence of pub-
lished ORs less than 1.0 produced by less precise (gener-
ally smaller) studies, suggested possible publication bias.
When we excluded study results with standard errors
greater than 1.0 (the set with asymmetric estimates), the
revised estimate for this outcome differed by only 0.01
from the estimate in Table 1, suggesting that publication
bias had little effect on the central estimates.
Discussion
The results of these meta-analyses indicate that building
dampness and mold are associated with moderate but
statistically significant increases in respiratory infections
and bronchitis. The central estimates and confidence
limits for these associations were stable across different
modeling strategies: adding studies that controlled for
fewer confounding variables, assuming independence of
multiple estimates from the same studies, and omitting
included RRs. Also, analyses suggest that publication
bias likely had little impact on these estimates.
The statistical associations reported here do not docu-
ment that dampness and mold are causally related to
the bronchitis and respiratory infections. Building damp-
ness itself is unlikely to directly cause adverse health
effects. If these associations are confirmed as causal,
exposure to one or more dampness-related agents,
either microbiologic or chemical, is likely to be ulti-
mately implicated. However, the consistent evidence of
adverse health effects from a substantial number of stu-
dies that have controlled for key potential confounders,
along with the moderately strong associations and the
limited evidence of publication bias, provide initial evi-
dence for causal links between these health effects and
some dampness related agent(s).
Evidence for relationships of dampness or mold with
respiratory infections and bronchitis has strengthened –
initially anecdotal, now documented in multiple observa-
tional studies. Within the past decade, there have been
at least three major qualitative reviews of the associa-
tions of dampness and mold with health outcomes. An
interdisciplinary Nordic review panel in 2001 [11] con-
cluded “There also seems to be an association between
dampness and.... airway infections.” but this review pro-
vided no conclusions pertaining to the association of
dampness with bronchitis. The IOM review in 2004 [2]
made no conclusions relative to the association of
dampness or mold with respiratory infections or bron-
chitis, but stated “Healthy persons exposed to dampness
or moldy indoor environments sometimes report that
they are more prone to respiratory infections....” The
most recent review, by WHO in 2009 [3], concluded
Figure 1 Odds ratios and confidence intervals from all studies meeting the less restricted eligibility criteria and from a meta-analysis
of these studies performed using the random effects model and assuming dependent estimates within studies. The width of the boxes
(some so small they appear as points) is proportional to the precision of the study and the ends of the horizontal lines represent lower and
upper 95% confidence limits. The left vertical line marks an odds ratio of 1.0, corresponding to no increased risk, while most of the reported
odds ratios are greater than unity indicating an increase in risk with dampness and mold. The central estimate from the meta-analysis is
indicated by the right vertical line and the left- and right-side points of the diamond at the bottom of the figure indicate the lower and upper
95% confidence limits from the meta-analyses.

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9/1/72
Page 6 of 11that there is sufficient evidence to document an associa-
tion of dampness and dampness-related agents with
respiratory infections, but only limited or suggestive evi-
dence of an association for bronchitis. The results of the
present quantitative meta-analyses are consistent with
the WHO findings for respiratory infections, but imply
more strongly that dampness and mold are associated
with bronchitis.
Prior quantitative meta-analyses on health effects of
dampness and mold have not included a category for
respiratory tract infections overall. The meta-analysis by
Antova et al. [5] on visible mold in residences and bron-
chitis in children, based on a set of similar European
studies, reported an OR (95% CI) of 1.38 (1.29-1.47).
This compares well to the summary OR reported here
for dampness or mold in residences and bronchitis,
based on the larger medical literature, of 1.45 (1.32-
1.59).
The outcome categories included in this review con-
tain a variety of specific diseases, with all but chronic
bronchitis caused by a range of infectious organisms.
We will consider biologic plausibility of the associations
reviewed here separately for the infectious and non-
infectious mechanisms.
Respiratory infections include upper and lower
respiratory tract infections and otitis media. Upper
respiratory tract infections include common colds, phar-
yngitis (sore throat), and sinusitis. Most are caused by
viruses such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, or
respiratory syncytial virus, although a minority of cases
is caused by bacteria [12]. Otitis media, an infection or
inflammation of the middle ear often resulting from a
prior upper respiratory tract infection, can be bacterial
or viral in origin [13].
Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumo-
nia, acute bronchitis, and acute exacerbation of chronic
bronchitis, can result from a variety of causal organisms,
including Haemophilus influenza, Streptococcus pneumo-
niae, and Moraxella catarhalis [14]. Pneumonia is an
inflammation of the lung, caused usually by an infection
from bacteria, virus, or fungi, but sometimes by acciden-
tal inhalation of other substances [15]. Bronchitis, an
inflammation of the mucus membranes of the bronchi,
can be acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis often occurs
in conjunction with viral infections such as common
cold (e.g., rhinovirus, adenovirus), respiratory syncytial
virus, or influenza, with a minority of cases caused by
bacterial infections. In contrast, chronic bronchitis is
generally caused not by respiratory infection, but by
recurring injury or irritation to the lining of the bronchi,
such as from tobacco smoke or irritating dust or fumes
[16].
An evident increase in respiratory infections in asso-
ciation with dampness or mold could occur from
increased numbers of infections, or from more serious
infections that are more clinically apparent; either might
result from impairment of immune defenses. Although
the specific exposures occurring in the reviewed studies
are not known, and although it has not been demon-
strated that exposures to microbial toxins in typical
damp or moldy houses can suppress immune response
in humans, potential underlying mechanisms can be
suggested. Studies both in vitro and in vivo have
demonstrated inflammatory and immunosuppressive
responses to the spores, metabolites, and components of
specific microorganisms found in damp buildings [2,3].
Repeated activation of immune responses and inflamma-
tion from microbiologic exposures may contribute to

Page 7 of 11inflammation-related
diseases,
and
the
resulting
inflamed mucosal tissue may provide a diminished bar-
rier to respiratory infections. Observed synergistic inter-
actions in toxicologic studies among microbial agents
present in damp buildings, including specific fungi, acti-
nomycetes, and amoebae (e.g. [17,18]) suggest that
immunotoxic effects of fungal and bacterial strains typi-
cally found in damp buildings may be potentiated dur-
ing joint exposures. This could explain lack of evident
associations for specific exposures. Thus, some biologic
plausibility is evident even in the absence of consistent
associations between human exposures to specific
microorganisms or microbial components or products
and respiratory infections in healthy individuals.
For chronic bronchitis, more often caused by chronic
exposures to irritants and inflammatory agents, the
immunostimulatory and inflammatory agents and aller-
gens in some molds and other dampness-related micro-
bial agents may explain or contribute to the associations
[2,3]. Also, dampness in building materials can increase
the emission rates and indoor concentrations of some
chemicals [2], such as formaldehyde, which could cause
irritation or inflammation [19,20].
Our analysis is subject to multiple limitations. Publica-
tion bias in the selection of available studies remains a
possibility despite the limited evidence of publication
bias effects described above. Estimates from random
effects models should be interpreted with caution when
the number of observations is small, as in some sub-
analyses reported here. The test of heterogeneity used
here has low power to reject the null hypothesis when
the number of included findings is small.
The respiratory infections category used in this analy-
sis is broad, including outcome definitions of various
types of lower respiratory infections that include acute
bronchitis; common cold; mixes of lower and upper
respiratory infections; and upper respiratory infections
including otitis. There were not sufficient numbers of
most outcomes for separate analyses. We have sepa-
rately estimated summary measures of effect for bron-
chitis (acute or chronic), respiratory infections overall,
and various subsets of respiratory infections. It is possi-
ble that some disease caused by allergy or irritation,
especially in the upper respiratory tract, was classified
erroneously as respiratory infection. Since allergy and
irritation are known to be associated with damp indoor
spaces, this could have resulted in erroneously linking
dampness and mold with respiratory infections. To
check this possibility, we estimated risks for a restricted
set of respiratory infections: including lower respiratory
infections plus specific upper respiratory infections of
tonsillitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, and otitis, but excluding
common cold and less specific upper respiratory
infections (e.g., acute upper airway infections, airway
infection, and frequent childhood respiratory infections),
with the highest potential of being allergic or irritant
outcomes misclassified as infections. Because this
restriction of the respiratory infection outcomes
increased the summary OR slightly from 1.44 to 1.50
(and reduced heterogeneity of findings), this potential
misclassification is not likely to explain the elevated risk
of infections found here with dampness or mold.
Regarding the summary OR of 1.38 for common cold
and acute upper respiratory infections, it is not clear
how much allergic and irritant effects have been
included with true upper respiratory infections. We did
not estimate effects for a category of lower respiratory
infections because these findings were mostly for acute
bronchitis. There were only seven findings for pneumo-
nia from three studies (ORs 0.79, 1.30, 1.33, 1.71, 1.77,
1.85, and 2.3), too few to allow confidence in a meta-
analysis (estimated summary OR = 1.57), but suggestive
of increased risk.
The substantial diversity of findings in the studies
reviewed here was evident in the initial low p-values for
heterogeneity. When acute bronchitis findings were
restricted to studies adjusted for the four key confound-
ing variables, the p-value for heterogeneity increased to
0.12. This suggests that heterogeneity for the unrest-
ricted findings may have been due to scattered estimates
from less well-adjusted studies. That the central OR
estimate, 1.45, remained unchanged with this restriction
suggests scatter in the unrestricted findings rather than
systematic bias.
For the respiratory infection group, restriction to find-
ings from more consistently adjusted models omitted
many of the most extreme estimates (e.g., 0.48, 0.49, 4.4,
4.8), but did not decrease heterogeneity of the remaining
findings. Exclusion of relatively nonspecific upper
respiratory infections, which might be misdiagnosed
allergic or irritant effects, increased the central estimate
to 1.50 and decreased heterogeneity (p = 0.07), whereas
the estimate for common cold or acute upper respira-
tory infection was 1.38. While substantial heterogeneity
remained within many of the subgroups listed in Table 3,
for those subgroups with little heterogeneity within, dif-
ferences in OR were not large.
Because of the small number of available studies and
the frequent use of outcomes containing multiple dis-
eases, clear conclusions cannot be drawn about even
associations with specific infectious diseases such as
influenza. While the central estimate for common cold
or acute upper respiratory infection of OR = 1.38, the
lack of homogeneity in the included findings and the
uncertain diagnosis makes this estimate only suggestive.
Most studies included here relied on occupant report-
ing of dampness and mold, a possible source of both
systematic bias and error. However, two prior reviews
Fisk et al. Environmental Health 2010, 9:72
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/9/1/72
Page 8 of 11have considered whether biased subjective response by
building occupants in dampness studies might have
positively biased the findings. The prior comparison by
Fisk et al. of occupant-reported versus independent
researcher-based assessments of dampness and mold in
six studies [4] concluded that it is “very unlikely that the
observed association of respiratory health effects with
dampness and mold is a consequence of over-reporting
of dampness and mold by occupants with respiratory
symptoms.” Bornehag et al. [11] reported that findings
of studies with independent assessment of both damp-
ness and health effects were similar to findings of stu-
dies with more subjective information sources.
The use of subjective, qualitative assessments of
dampness and mold, even if not systematically biased,
will misclassify actual causal exposures. However, these
subjective metrics are currently the most useful corre-
lates of health effects. Direct causal exposures related to
dampness and mold have not yet been documented.
Many quantified assessments of microbial exposures
have been studied, and they have not shown consistent
associations with specific health effects in healthy indivi-
duals [3]. This is likely because the specific causal expo-
sures involved have either not yet been identified or not
been well measured. Also, as Antova et al. say, visible
molds “may better represent long-term exposure to
moulds than direct measurements during a short sam-
pling time [5].”
The majority of underlying data are from cross sec-
tional studies that are subject to confounding and other
limitations inherent in that study design, despite the
attempts to control for known confounders. The result-
ing estimates are all less than 1.5, making their eleva-
tions especially susceptible to alternate explanation by
unmeasured confounding factors and other biases rather
than by dampness- or mold- related exposures. It is not
clear what additional confounding variables might
explain these findings consistently across studies. On
the other hand, since the risk factors assessed in these
studies are likely to be surrogates for unmeasured
indoor dampness-related causal exposures, ORs for the
true causal exposures would be higher.
The primary summary estimates reported here
required that studies controlled at least for age, gender,
smoking, and SES (although many included studies also
controlled for other factors). If studies did not ade-
quately control for all important confounders, biased
estimates may have resulted. Evidence suggesting that
substantial residual bias was unlikely comes from the
paper by Antova et al. [5]. Only two of the 23 studies
included here were among the 12 included in Antova et
al. Yet findings for bronchitis here and in the pooled
data analysis of over 58,000 children by Antova et al
were very similar, even though Antova et al. adjusted for
13 potential confounding factors - age, gender, current
smoker in household, maternal smoking during preg-
nancy, maternal and paternal education, household
crowding, nationality, gas cooking, unvented gas/oil/ker-
osene heaters, birth order, “ever had a pet,” and study
area. Also, the analysis by Antova et al., when adjusted
only for age, gender, and geographic area, gave similar
estimates as when adjusted for many factors. Although
the estimates included in Antova’s summary for bron-
chitis had significant heterogeneity, estimates from all
included studies exceeded 1.0, and CIs for nine of the
10 exceeded 1.0. Furthermore, Antova et al. performed a
sensitivity analysis on potential heterogeneity on other
variables such as season of questionnaire, age of subject,
year of study, and response rate, and found little effect
other than a significantly higher ORs for bronchitis in
studies with above 80% response. Overall, this suggests
that the relationships of bronchitis and various other
respiratory outcomes to mold are not much confounded
by the most obvious variables, and are not modified
substantially by other key variables.
Respiratory tract infections, the most common infec-
tious diseases in humans, have large health and cost
consequences for individuals and for the public. Acute
lower respiratory infections are the leading cause of
death in children below five years old worldwide [14].
Community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., not hospital-
acquired or in the immunosuppressed) is a major
cause of hospitalization and morbidity and costs more
than $17 billion dollars annually in the U.S. [15]. Otitis
media is the most common bacterial infection in chil-
dren, and is a major cause for antibiotic prescriptions
[13]. Estimates of the prevalence of dampness or mold
problems in houses are available from multiple sources,
and include the following: at least 20% in European
countries, the U.S., and Canada [2]; 14-40% in Europe,
Russia, and North America [5]; and 50% in the U.S. [21].
Little effective prevention is currently possible for
human respiratory infections outside of attempting to
avoid contact with or spreading infections, vaccination
for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia, and possi-
bly specific nutritional supplementation [22]. The few
documented environmental risk factors for respiratory
infections include environmental tobacco smoke [23],
wood or biofuel stoves [24], and low building ventilation
rates [25]. If prevention and remediation of dampness
and mold in houses and other buildings were documen-
ted to substantially reduce some or all types of human
respiratory infections, this would be good and important
news.

[26] where: Pe is the proportion of the population

Based on a proportion of damp/moldy housing in the
population of 20-50% [21], and selected ORs in Table 3,
approximate ARPs would be: for acute bronchitis, 8-
18%; for respiratory infections excluding common cold
and nonspecific upper respiratory infections, 9-20%; and
for respiratory infections in children or infants, 9-19%.
Thus, if exposures related to residential dampness or
mold directly caused respiratory infections, then pre-
venting or remediating all this dampness and mold
would reduce the prevalence of various respiratory
infections by approximately 8-20%.
Thus, this review provides evidence that preventing
or remediating dampness and mold in residences, a
very common condition, may substantially reduce the
burden of respiratory infections. This could be one of
the few available preventive environmental strategies
for these common diseases, now considered mostly
inevitable. In addition, most exacerbations of asthma
have been shown to occur in the presence of viral
respiratory infections [27], and hospitalizations for
severe exacerbations of asthma are strongly associated
with viral infections [28]. This agrees with the finding
that dampness and mold in buildings are associated
consistently with asthma exacerbation [2,3]. Thus,
reduction in viral respiratory infections may have
important dual benefits.
Conclusions
Dampness and mold in buildings are associated with
moderate but statistically significant increases in respira-
tory infections and bronchitis. If these associations were
causal, reducing dampness and mold in buildings would
reduce the occurrence of respiratory infections, the
most common human infections. The results of these
meta-analyses provide support for recommendations by
the Institute of Medicine and WHO to prevent building
dampness and mold problems in buildings, and to take
corrective actions where such problems occur. Addi-
tional focused research is necessary to document
whether these associations are causal, and to develop
more objective assessment tools for dampness, mold, or
various other microbiologic factors that correlate with
human health effects.

ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate the association between arsenic
exposure and mortality from cardiovascular disease and
to assess whether cigarette smoking influences the
association.
Design Prospective cohort study with arsenic exposure
measured in drinking water from wells and urine.
Setting General population in Araihazar, Bangladesh.
Participants 11746 men and women who provided urine
samples in 2000 and were followed up for an average of 6.
6 years.
Main outcome measure Death from cardiovascular
disease.
Results 198 people died from diseases of circulatory
system, accounting for 43% of total mortality in the
population. The mortality rate for cardiovascular disease
was 214.3 per 100 000 person years in people drinking
water containing <12.0 µg/L arsenic, compared with 271.1
per 100 000 person years in people drinking water with
≥12.0 µg/L arsenic. There was a dose-response relation
between exposure to arsenic in well water assessed at
baseline and mortality from ischaemic heart disease and
other heart disease; the hazard ratios in increasing
quarters of arsenic concentration in well water (0.1-12.0,
12.1-62.0, 62.1-148.0, and 148.1-864.0 µg/L) were 1.00
(reference), 1.22 (0.65 to 2.32), 1.35 (0.71 to 2.57), and
1.92 (1.07 to 3.43) (P=0.0019 for trend), respectively,
after adjustment for potential confounders including age,
sex, smoking status, educational attainment, body mass
index (BMI), and changes in urinary arsenic concentration
since baseline. Similar associations were observed when
baseline total urinary arsenic was used as the exposure
variable and for mortality from ischaemic heart disease
specifically. The data indicate a significant synergistic
interaction between arsenic exposure and cigarette
smoking in mortality from ischaemic heart disease and
other heart disease. In particular, the hazard ratio for the
joint effect of a moderate level of arsenic exposure
(middle third of well arsenic concentration 25.3-
114.0 µg/L, mean 63.5 µg/L) and cigarette smoking on
mortality from heart disease was greater than the sum of
the hazard ratios associated with their individual effect
(relative excess risk for interaction 1.56, 0.05 to 3.14;
P=0.010).
Conclusions Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is
adversely associated with mortality from heart disease,
especially among smokers.
INTRODUCTION
Arsenic is a natural element of the earth’s crust, which
can enter drinking water supplies from natural depos-
its. Raised concentrations of arsenic in groundwater
pose a public health threat to millions of people world-
wide, including 13 million residents in the United
States.1
Although
the
International
Agency
for
Research on Cancer has classified arsenic as a group
1 human carcinogen, evidence of other effects on
health, including cardiovascular effects, has not been
well established.2 3
High levels of arsenic exposure (>500 µg/L) in
drinking water have been related to increased risks in
many
cardiovascular
diseases,
including
hypertension,4 5 ischaemic heart disease,6 7 and carotid
atherosclerosis8 in a series of retrospective cohort stu-
dies in south western Taiwan and Chile.6 8-11 Several
studies in the United States and Spain have reported
positive associations between arsenic exposure at
lower concentrations (<300 µg/L) and mortality from
coronary heart disease, hypertension, hypertensive
heart disease, or diseases of arteries, arterioles, and
capillaries.12-15 The use of ecological study designs12-14

page 1 of 11limits the causal inference in studies that investigated
effects of lower concentrations. In addition, previous
studies have reported that the risks associated with
arsenic
exposure
for
skin
lesions,16 17
bladder
cancer,18 19 and lung cancer20 are higher among smo-
kers. Studies examining the potential interaction
between arsenic exposure and cigarette smoking in
the risk of cardiovascular disease, however, are lack-
ing. As cardiovascular disease leads to about a third
of the mortality in the world, a small increased risk
associated with arsenic exposure would translate into
a large number of excess deaths in the exposed popula-
tion and could be of major importance to public health.
Prospective studies with multiple exposure measures
and informationon susceptible factors such as cigarette
smoking at the individual level are needed.
The contamination of groundwater with arsenic in
Bangladesh has been recognised as a massive public
health hazard.21 22 An estimated 57 million people
have been chronically exposed to groundwater with
arsenic
concentrations
exceeding
the
WHO
standard.23 To evaluate the health effects of such expo-
sure, in 2000 we established a cohort study in Araiha-
zar, Bangladesh. The study, with participants exposed
to arsenic concentrations in water from drinking wells
from 0.1 µg/L to 864 µg/L (mean 99 µg /L) at baseline,
provides us with a unique opportunity to evaluate the
cardiovascular effects of exposure at low to moderate
concentrations.
We tested the hypothesis that exposure to arsenic,
measured in both water and urine, is associated with
mortality from cardiovascular disease. We also tested
the hypotheses that cigarette smoking increases the
susceptibility to the cardiovascular effects of arsenic
exposure.
METHODS
The study is an ongoing prospective cohort study in
Araihazar, Bangladesh. Details of the methods have
been presented elsewhere.24 25 Briefly, before partici-
pants were recruited, water samples and their geogra-
phical coordinates were collected for 5966 contiguous
wells in a well defined area of 25 km2. Between Octo-
ber 2000 and May 2002, we recruited 11 746 men and
women who met the following eligibility criteria: mar-
ried (to reduce loss to follow-up) and aged between 18-
75; living in the study area for at least five years before
recruitment; and primary user of one of the 5966 tube
wells, designated as the “index” well, for at least three
years.24 The response rate was 97.5%.24 Information on
demographic and lifestyle variables was collected with
a standardised questionnaire at baseline and follow-up
visits. Trained clinicians measured blood pressure with
an automatic sphygmomanometer.26 Participants who
said that a physician had given them a diagnosis of dia-
betes before baseline were retrospectively identified
from data collected at the first follow-up.27 The com-
parison between self reported diabetes status and test
results for blood glycosylated haemoglobin and gluco-
suria suggested validity of the questionnaire data.27
The cohort is being actively followed with a personal
visit at two year intervals, which includes a physical
examination and structured interview conducted by
trained physicians following the same procedures
used in the baseline interview. The present study
includes data from the first (September 2002 to May
2004), second (June 2004 to August 2006), and third
(January 2007 to March 2009) follow-up. In addition,
a field clinic was established for cohort participants for
follow-up between their biennial visits.24
Assessment of causes of deaths
Our outcome of interest was deaths from cardio-
vascular disease, defined as deaths from disease of cir-
culatory system (ICD-10 (international classification of
diseases, 10th revision) codes I00-I99) in cohort parti-
cipants from baseline to 18 March 2009 (end of the
third follow-up). Details of the methods for the assess-
ment of causes of deaths are described elsewhere.28
Briefly, we adapted a validated verbal autopsy proce-
dure, developed by the International Centre for Diar-
rhea Disease Research, Bangladesh, in collaboration
with the World Health Organization, to ascertain the
causes of deaths. During the follow-up, on receipt of a
report of death from family or neighbours, a study phy-
sician and a trained social worker administered the ver-
bal autopsy form to the next of kin. Medical records
from physicians who had treated the dead person
were collected. For deaths in hospital, information on
death certificates and biopsies was ascertained. Each
month an outcome assessment committee, consisting
of physicians and consulting medical specialists
blinded to the exposure status, reviewed the data.
Causes of deaths were coded according to the WHO
classification29 and ICD-10.30 The International Cen-
tre for Diarrhea Disease Research, Bangladesh, has
used this method to ascertain causes of deaths since
197131 32 and documented an overall 95% specificity,
with a 85% sensitivity for deaths from cancer and up
to 85% sensitivity for cardiovascular deaths.33
Measurements of arsenic exposure
At baseline, water samples from all 5966 tube wells in
the study area were collected in 50 mL acid washed
tubes after the well was pumped for five minutes.34 35
Total arsenic concentration was determined by gra-
phite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with a
Hitachi Z-8200 system.36 Samples that fell below the
detection limit (5 μg/L) were subsequently analysed
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,
with a detection limit of 0.1 μg/L.37 Analyses for time
series samples collected from a subset of tube wells in
thestudy areashowed littlevariation in arsenicconcen-
tration over time.36 We therefore used the same arsenic
concentration for a given well as the exposure level for
its users who were recruited in the study, even if they
were included at different time frames.
All participants were primary users of one of the 5966
tube wells; 89% of study participants shared tube wells
with up to five other study participants, while the 14%
remaining shared their wells with 6-13 others.38 Using
baseline data, we derived a time weighted arsenic
RESEARCH

BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.comconcentration as a function of drinking durations and
well arsenic concentrations (see equation A in fig 1).38
The average duration of use of wells for wells with a
known arsenic concentration accounted for 25% of life-
time (>8 years) for both sexes.38
Spot urine samples were collected from 11224
(95.6%) of 11746 interviewed participants at baseline,
11109 (98.1%) of 11323 at the first follow-up, and
10726 (98.1%) of 10934 at the second follow-up. Total
urinaryarsenicconcentrationwasmeasuredbygraphite
furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, with a Perkin-
Elmer AAnalyst 600 graphite furnace system with a
detection limit of 2 μg/L, as previously described.39
Urinary creatinine was analysed with a method based
on the Jaffe reaction for adjustment of urinary total
arsenic concentration.40 We implemented an arsenic
mitigation programme in the study area at baseline to
promote switching to safe wells—that is, to wells yield-
ing water with an arsenic concentration lower than the
Bangladesh standard of 50 µg/L.41 As exposure concen-
trationmightchangeinsomeparticipantsfrombaseline,
we calculated changes in urinary arsenic between visits
using urinary creatinine adjusted arsenic.
Measurements of dietary intakes
Dietary intakes were measured at baseline with a vali-
dated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire
designed for the study population. Detailed informa-
tion on the design and the validation of the food fre-
quency questionnaire has been published elsewhere.42
Briefly, to assess the validity of the questionnaire,
trained interviewers completed two seven-day food
diaries in two separate seasons for 189 participants.
The results of the validation study indicate that the
food frequency questionnaire provides reasonably
valid measurements for long term dietary intakes of
common
foods,
macronutrients,
and
common
micronutrients.42
Statistical analysis
Primary objectives: association between arsenic exposure
and mortality from cardiovascular disease
We computed person time from baseline to the date of
death from any cause or the date of the third active
follow-up visit, whichever came first. We used Cox
proportional hazards regression to compute the hazard
ratios for deaths from disease of the circulatory system,
ischaemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease,
in relation to quarters of baseline well arsenic concen-
tration, time weighted arsenic concentration, baseline
urinary arsenic concentration, and changes in urinary
arsenic between visits. We also estimated the hazard
ratios in relation to 1 SD increase in well arsenic or
urinary arsenic for better interpretation of the effect
estimates. The assumption of proportional hazards
was examined by testing the cross product terms
between covariate variables and log function of survi-
val time, and P values for all the terms were >0.10. We
examined the assumption of non-linear effect of
arsenic exposure by including higher order poly-
nomial terms for arsenic exposure variables in the
models, and there was no indication of any non-linear
relation. Because deaths from other forms of heart dis-
ease were often a consequence of previous ischaemic
heart disease in our study population, and patterns of
the hazard ratios were similar for ischaemic heart dis-
ease and other forms of heart disease, we estimated the
hazard ratios for the combined category and for ischae-
mic heart disease separately.
We first adjusted for age at baseline and sex. A sec-
ond model was constructed to additionally adjust for a
priori defined potential confounders, including base-
line educational level (years), body mass index
(BMI), and smoking status (never, past, and current),
all of which are known risk factors for cardiovascular
disease that might be related to the distribution of base-
line arsenic exposure or influence health effects of
arsenic exposure in our study population.16 38 43 Appen-
dix 1 on bmj.com shows the associations between
potential confounders and well arsenic concentration.
We included changes in urinary arsenic between visits
as a time dependent variable. For instance, for deaths
from cardiovascular disease that occurred between the
first and second follow-up, we used the difference in
urinary creatinine adjusted arsenic (urinary arsenic
concentration with adjustment for creatinine in the
urine) between the baseline and first follow-up as the
relevant changes in urinary arsenic. Missing data
(<2%) were coded by using dummy variables, allowing
participants with one or more missing potential con-
founders to be included in the analyses under a “miss-
ing at random” assumption. In the same models, we
also explored the association between changes in urin-
ary arsenicbetween visitsand therisk of mortality from
cardiovascular disease.
We estimated the population attributable propor-
tion of mortality from cardiovascular disease asso-
ciated with higher concentrations of baseline well
arsenic concentration (>12 µg/L) using adjusted
hazard
ratios

As fish can accumulate organic arsenic, which could
influence total urinary arsenic concentration, rice can
contain inorganic arsenic from the soil, and arsenic has
been related to increased risk of hypertension and
diabetes,45 46 we performed a sensitivity analysis to
evaluate whether the association between arsenic
exposure and risk of cardiovascular disease can be
attributable to arsenic from intakes of fish and rice, or
to the association of arsenic exposure with diabetes and
hypertension. The adjustment for creatinine might
influence the relation between arsenic and disease out-
comes

in

sectional
studies.47 48 Although our study is a prospective cohort
study, we also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess
whether the association between urinary arsenic and
risk of cardiovascular disease was different when we
did not adjust for urinary creatinine. Given the sample
size, we had 80% power with α=0.05 to detect a hazard
ratio of 1.22 for cardiovascular disease mortality asso-
ciatedwith1 SD differencein baselinewell arseniccon-
centration.
Secondary objectives: synergy between arsenic exposure and
cigarette smoking in mortality from heart disease
We assessed the presence of synergy (that is, epidemio-
logical interaction or positive interaction on an addi-
tive scale) between arsenic exposure and cigarette
smoking by testing whether the joint effect from expo-
sure to both factors was greater than the sum of their
independent effects. We considered similar analysis
methods and classification of smokers used in previous
studies assessing synergy between arsenic exposure
and smoking in the risk of lung cancer and skin
lesions.16 20 49 Rothman has discussed the use of relative
excess risk for interaction (RERI) in assessing additive
interactions.50 The additivity of risks associated with
two exposures corresponds to (R11−R00) = (R01−R00)
+ (R10−R00), where R11 is the risk of disease associated
with having both exposures, R10 and R01 are the risks
of disease associated with one of the exposures along,
and R00 is the risk of disease associated with absence of
bothexposures(backgroundrisk).The equationcanbe
represented with risk ratios by dividing all the compo-
nents by R00 and assessing whether the relative excess
risk for interaction (relative excess risk for interaction,
RR11−RR10−RR01+1) is greater than zero and can be
used to evaluate if there is a positive departure from
additivity, or synergy, of the effects from two
exposures.50 We used adjusted hazard ratios as surro-
gates of
risk ratios in the following equation:
RERI≈HR11−HR10−HR01+1, where HR11 indicates
the hazard ratio for disease associated with a higher
level of arsenic exposure (moderate or high level) and
tobacco smoking (ever, current, or past) in comparison
to the a priori reference group with the lowest level of
arsenic exposure and never smoking; HR10 indicates
hazard ratio for a higher level of arsenic exposure
alone; and HR01 denotes hazard ratio for tobacco
smoking alone. We also estimated the attributable
proportion attributable to interaction as RERI/HR11
.50 To increase power for interaction analyses, we
used thirds of arsenic exposure instead of quarters.
We estimated the relative excess risk for interaction
with arsenic exposure considered as a continuous vari-
able as follows: (eβ1+β2+β3)−(eβ1)−(eβ2)+1, where β1 is the
coefficient of the effect of per SD increase in the arsenic
exposure measure, β2 is the coefficient of tobacco
smoking, and β3 is the coefficient of the cross product
of per SD increase in arsenic exposure and tobacco
smoking.49 51 52 Confidence intervals of the relative
excess risk for interaction were estimated for statistical
inferences by using the standard delta method
described by Hosmer and Lemeshow51 53 (for categori-
cal arsenic exposure) and bootstrap method with 1000
bootstrap
samples
(for
continuous
exposure
measure).52 As the relative excess risk for interaction
is a measure of difference in excess relative risks, an
estimate over zero indicates presence of synergy of
two risk factors, and a 95% confidence interval that is
positive and excludes zero corresponds to P<0.05.
As some participants shared the same well, we used
robust standard errors for the proportional hazards
model54 to account for the potential influence of corre-
lated exposure data. We also carried out sensitivity
analyses to exclude participants with any missing
data or imputed using the median values of the covari-
ates. All analysis was conducted with SAS 9.2
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
We observed 77 252 person years during the follow-up
period.There were460 deaths, of which 198 were from
diseases of circulatory system (ICD-10 codes I00-I99),
accounting for 43% of total mortality in the population
and yielding a mortality rate of 256.3 per 100 000 per-
son years. Among the 198 deaths from cardiovascular
disease, 85 were from cerebrovascular disease (codes
I60-I69); 104 were from ischaemic heart disease (codes
I20-I25, n=71) or other forms of heart disease (codes
I30-I52, n=33), which included mostly deaths from
heart failure (codes I50.0-I50.9, n = 32) and ventricular
tachycardia (code I47, n=1); and nine deaths were from
pulmonary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease,
or multiple valve diseases (codes I08, I11, and I27).
Higher BMI and presence of diabetes were asso-
ciated with an increased risk of death from ischaemic
heart disease and other heart disease (table 1). There
was no association between educational level and mor-
tality from either diseases of the circulatory system
overall or any of the subtypes of cardiovascular dis-
ease. Diastolic and systolic hypertension were related
to an increased risk of death from diseases of the circu-
latory system overall and all subtypes of cardio-
vascular disease, and the associations were stronger
for cerebrovascular disease. Participants who were cur-
rent smokers, had smoked for at least 20 years, or had
accumulated at least 10 pack years at baseline were 1.6
to 1.9 times more likely to die from disease of circula-
tory system and 2.2 to 2.7 times more likely to die from
ischaemic heart disease and other heart disease.

BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.comPrimary objectives: association between arsenic exposure
and cardiovascular disease mortality
We found an increased risk of mortality from diseases
of the circulatory system in people with high concen-
trations of well arsenic. The mortality rate for cardio-
vascular disease was 214.3 per 100 000 person years in
people drinking water containing <12.0 µg/L arsenic
compared with 271.1 per 100 000 person years in peo-
ple drinking water with ≥12.0 µg/L arsenic. Partici-
pants exposed to >148 µg/L (mean 265.7 µg/L) of
well arsenic were 1.47 (95% confidence interval 0.99
to 2.18) times more likely to die from diseases of the
circulatory system compared with their counterparts
who were exposed to <12 µg/L (model 2, table 2).
There was an increased risk of mortality from ischae-
mic heart disease and other heart disease in relation to
high concentrations of well arsenic, and a dose-
response relation remained after adjustment for BMI,
smokingstatus, educational attainment, and changesin
arsenic concentration between visits adjusted for urin-
ary creatinine in addition to age and sex (model 2,
P=0.0019 for trend). The hazard ratio was 1.29 (1.10
to 1.52, model 2) for a 1 SD increase in well arsenic
concentration (115 µg/L). A similar association was
observed between baseline well arsenic and mortality
from
ischaemic
heart
disease;
participants
with
>148 µg/L of arsenic in well water were 1.94 (0.99 to
3.84) times more likely to die from ischaemic heart dis-
ease compared with those with <12 µg/L (model 2,
P=0.0294 for trend). The hazard ratio was 1.25 (1.03
to 1.52, model 2) for a 1 SD increase in well arsenic
concentration. On the other hand, there was no asso-
ciation between well arsenic and mortality from
cerebrovascular disease. Analysis results were similar
when we used time weighted arsenic concentration as
the exposure measure (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).

page 5 of 11Additional control for systolic blood pressure, baseline
diabetes, and dietary intake of fish and rice did not
appreciably change effect estimates (see appendix 3 on
bmj.com). When participants with missing values for
BMI, education level, smoking status, and changes in
urinary arsenic between visits were excluded or
imputed by using the median level in the population,
the results were similar (data not shown).
We observed similar patterns of hazard ratios when
we used baseline urinary arsenic as the exposure vari-
able in the analyses (table 3). Baseline urinary arsenic
was related to an increased risk of mortality from dis-
eases of the circulatory system (model 2, P=0.0065 for
trend), and the association was stronger for the com-
bined category of ischaemic heart disease and other
heart disease (model 2, P=0.0001for trend). The effect
estimates did not materially change when we did not
adjust for urinary creatinine. For instance, the associa-
tion between urinary arsenic and mortality from heart
disease in increasing quarters of urinary arsenic con-
centrations were 1.00 (reference), 1.07 (0.57 to 2.03),
1.44 (0.81 to 2.57), and 2.08 (1.09 to 3.95) (P=0.0001for
trend) (data not shown).
Spearman correlations of baseline urinary arsenic
with urinary arsenic measured at first and second fol-
low-up were both 0.65. Overall, total urinary arsenic
decreased by an average of 57.1 µg/g of creatinine
from baseline to first follow-up and then essentially
remained stable with an average increase of 3.2 µg/g
creatinine from first to second follow-up. The hazard
ratio was 1.18 (1.03 to 1.36) for total cardiovascular
disease mortality in relation to a 1 SD increase in
changes in urinary arsenic (240 µg per g of creatinine)
between visits, adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking
status, and baseline well arsenic concentration. The
number of deaths in extreme categories of changes in
urinary arsenic, however, was not enough for us to
evaluate the dose-response relation for specific cardio-
vascular disease subtypes.
Secondary objectives: synergy between arsenic exposure
and cigarette smoking in mortality from heart disease
Although not significant, the risk of mortality from
heart disease seemed to be higher for people with
high level of arsenic exposure who had ever smoked
(fig 2). The risk of dying from ischaemic heart disease
andother heart disease associatedwith moderate (25.3-
114.0 µg/L, mean 63.5 µg/L) or high levels of arsenic
exposure (>114 µg/L, mean 228.8 µg/L) was consis-
tently higher in those who had ever smoked and espe-
cially in current smokers at baseline compared with
those who had never smoked. The joint effect of mod-
erate or high levels of arsenic exposure and ever smok-
ing was greater than the sum of their individual effects,
with estimates of the relative excess risk due to inter-
action all greater than zero. In exploratory analyses,
when we further classified ever smokers into past and
current smokers, the synergistic effect between moder-
ate or high level of arsenic exposure and current smok-
ing was stronger (relative excess risk due to interaction
2.21 (0.11 to 4.31; P=0.036) and 1.43 (0.02 to 3.61;
P=0.045), respectively) (fig 2). Figure 3 shows the sur-
vival curves by thirds of well arsenic and smoking sta-
tus in men and women. The synergistic effect between
smoking and arsenic exposure was similar in men and
women. We found a similar pattern of estimates of rela-
tive excess risk due to interaction when we considered

There was a synergy between a 1 SD increase in well
arsenic concentration and ever smoking (0.38, 0.02 to
1.35), and the synergy was stronger with current smok-
ing status (0.67, 0.08 to 1.86).
DISCUSSION
Interpretation of the results
In this prospective cohort study exposure to arsenic
from drinking water, as measured in well water and
urine, was associated with an increased risk of cardio-
vascular disease, in particular ischaemic heart disease
and other heart disease. Based on our observed esti-
mates, 28.9% (1.4% to 60.0%) of deaths from heart dis-
ease in this population can be attributable to arsenic
concentrations over 12 µg/L in well water. We found
a synergistic effect betweenarsenicexposure andcigar-
ette smokingon mortality from ischaemicheart disease
and other heart disease, and this effect was apparent
even when arsenic exposure was moderate (25.3-
114.0 µg/L, mean 63.5 µg/L).
Comparison with other studies
Previous studies on mortality from cardiovascular dis-
ease in areas with low or moderate levels of arsenic
exposure from drinking water generated inconsistent
findings,12-15 probably because the exposure range was
limited in detecting the association and the limitation
of using group level exposure as exposure level for the
individuals. For instance, using mean arsenic level at
the county level and National Center for Health
Statistics data, an ecological study in US counties
found raised standardised mortality ratios for mortality
from diseases of the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries
associated with water arsenic concentration > 20 µg/L
but no associations for mortality from any other
cardiovascular diseases.12 The mortality from hyper-
tensive heart disease was raised in female but not in
male members of the Mormons in Millard County,
Utah, with <200 µg/L of arsenic in drinking water,
according to historical records of arsenic measure-
ments at the community level.13 Ecological measures
of arsenic exposure are subject to large measurement
errors when there is variation in water concentrations
within a study region. As the effects of low or moderate
levels of arsenic exposure on cardiovascular disease
risk are likely to be modest in magnitude, studies of
such levelsareparticularlysusceptibleto measurement
errors in ascertainment of exposure, which, in most
cases, would lead to bias towards the null but could
also generate spurious associations under certain
conditions.55 More recently, a cohort study in Bangla-
desh with well arsenic concentrations measured at
household level reported a dose-response relation
and an increased risk at exposures of 50-149 µg/L for
death from the combined category of cardiovascular
disease (hazard ratio 1.16, 0.96 to 1.40).33 A recent eco-
logical study in Spain reported raised mortality rates
for cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease
associated with arsenic exposure at 10-118 µg/L.15 Our
study confirmed and extended observations in pre-
vious reports in that the validity of the findings is

page 7 of 11strengthened by the prospective study design and the
fact that the outcome, potential confounders, effect
modifiers, and well arsenic and urinary arsenic were
all measured at the individual level.
Consistent with retrospective cohort and ecological
studies of mortality from cerebrovascular disease in
Chile, Taiwan, and Spain,11 15 56 we found no associa-
tion between arsenic exposure and mortality from
cerebrovascular disease. A cross sectional study in Tai-
wan, however, reported a positive association between
arsenic exposure and the prevalence of cerebro-
vascular disease.57 The conflicting results in the studies
could be partly because of the heterogeneity of the
causes of cerebrovascular disease. The distribution of
ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke might be
different in studies of mortality and prevalence of
cerebrovascular disease. Future larger studies with
subtypes of cerebrovascular disease are needed to
further assess the association.
We found that changes in urinary arsenic over time
were positively associated with the risk of mortality
from total cardiovascular disease. A study in Chile
has suggested that the latency required for arsenic
exposure to have an influence on the risk of cardio-
vascular disease was relatively shorter than that for
the risk of cancer.11 With longer follow-up, we will be
able to characterise this association and study the influ-
ence of changes in arsenic exposure on the risk of sub-
types of cardiovascular disease in the future.
Interaction between arsenic exposure and cigarette
smoking
The hypothesis that cigarette smoking increases sus-
ceptibility to the cardiovascular effects of arsenic is
well supported by previous studies on cancer and skin
lesions.16-20 58 Cigarette smoking has been associated
with a lower methylation capacity of arsenic, as indi-
cated by a higher ratio of urinary monomethylarsonate
to dimethylarsinate in smokers.59 Moreover, tobacco
smoking can increase the requirement of folate, a criti-
cal cofactor in one-carbon metabolism, a process
through which arsenic is enzymatically methylated.
Taken together, cigarette smoking is likely to influence
arsenic toxicity and should be taken into consideration
in studies of lower levels of arsenic exposure. The con-
sideration of smoking is more important for outcomes
such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, for
which arsenic might not be a necessary cause, as
opposed
to
skin lesions.
The
synergistic effect
observed in our study provides evidence of the pre-
sence of individuals who would experience a high
risk of ischaemic heart disease and other heart disease
only if they are exposed to both cigarette smoking and
arsenic exposure at concentrations as low as 25.3-
114.0 µg/L. The corresponding estimate for the attri-
butable proportion due to interaction is 59% (13.8% to
100%), indicating that as much as 59% of deaths from
heart disease among smokers with moderate level of
arsenic exposure might be attributable to the synergis-
tic effect of these two exposures. This finding has
important public health implications in that smoking
cessation or reduction in exposure to arsenic can lead
to a greater than expected reduction in mortality from
heart disease.
Potential underlying mechanisms
The mechanisms by which arsenic leads to cardio-
vascular disease are not clear. Several animal studies
have
suggested
that
arsenic
can
induce
atherosclerosis.60-62 The induction of oxidative stress
by arsenic can influence gene expression, inflamma-
tory
responses,
and
endothelial
nitric
oxide
homoeostasis,63 which play an important role in main-
taining vascular tone.64 In a cross sectional study of the
baseline data, we observed a positive association
between arsenic exposure and high pulse pressure,45
a
consequence
of
arteriosclerosis
and
arterial
stiffness.65 66 Several in vitro studies suggest that arsenic
promotes inflammatory activity61 67 and endothelial
cell remodelling.68 Among cases of arsenic induced
skin lesions in our study population, we found a posi-
tive association between arsenic exposure and plasma
concentrations of soluble cell adhesion molecules,
markers of endothelial dysfunction for risk of cardio-
vasculardisease.69 Future studies in healthy individuals
with preclinical phenotypes for vascular inflammation
and endothelial dysfunction relevant for cardio-
vascular disease are needed to clarify the underlying
mechanisms.

BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.comStrengths and limitations
Unique features of the present study include the avail-
ability of data on arsenic exposure measured in both
urine and water, the use of repeat measurements of
total urinary arsenicto measure internal doseof arsenic
exposure and to track changes in exposure levels over
time, and the information on cigarette smoking. In a
random 10% of participants, inorganic arsenic (AsV
and AsIII) and its metabolites monomethylarsonate
and dimethylarsinate accounted for 96% of total urin-
ary arsenic, whereas arsenobetaine and arsenocholine,
derived mainly from dietary intakes of certain marine
fish, together accounted for 3%.70 Thus well arsenic,
which has a correlation of 0.70, 0.61, and 0.57 with
total urinary arsenic, urinary dimethylarsinate, and
urinary
monomethylarsonate
concentration,
respectively,70 was clearly the main source of arsenic
in the urine.
Several potential limitations, however, should also
be noted. Firstly, we did not consider individual meta-
bolites of arsenic in urine or blood and therefore could
not assess susceptibility from arsenic methylation
capacity. We are currently assessing the role of arsenic
metabolites in modifying the risk of disease in a case-
cohort study. Secondly, the study results might not be
generalisable to other populations with a different pro-
file of risk factors for cardiovascular disease that might
interact with arsenic exposure in risk. In particular, the
study population consisted of married men and
women, who were mostly lean, with a mean BMI of
18.9. The choice of recruiting married men and
women, however, helped the retention of the partici-
pants in follow-up and should enhance internal validity
of the findings. Future studies are needed to evaluate
potential effect modifications by specific nutritional
factors that are related to arsenic metabolism, such as
folate and selenium. Lastly, our study is an observa-
tional study and might be susceptible to unmeasured
confounding. Individuals’ choice of well was largely
based on geographical convenience, however, and
well arsenic concentration was not well known
among the study population before recruitment.24 25 38
Though we did not collect information on hyperlipi-
daemia, available literature does not suggest a positive
association between arsenic exposures and cholesterol
profile.62 71 Adjustment for other established risk fac-
tors for cardiovascular disease did not change results
appreciably. We would therefore expect the impact of
residual confounding to be relatively minor.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in this prospective cohort analysis, we
found a dose-response relation between arsenic expo-
sure and mortality from cardiovascular disease, espe-
cially heart disease, at a much lower level of arsenic
exposure than previously reported. There was a syner-
gistic effect between cigarette smoking and arsenic
exposure at moderate or high levels on mortality
from ischaemic heart disease and other heart disease.
These findings suggest the cardiovascular effects of
arsenic exposure at moderate levels, which is further
potentiated by smoking.

Abstract
Objectives To estimate the short term effect of particulate air pollution
(particle diameter <10 μm, or PM10) on mortality and explore the
heterogeneity of particulate air pollution effects in major cities in China.
Design Generalised linear models with different lag structures using
time series data.
Setting 38 of the largest cities in 27 provinces of China (combined
population >200 million).
Participants 350 638 deaths (200 912 in males, 149 726 in females)
recorded in 38 city districts by the Disease Surveillance Point System
of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 1 January
2010 to 29 June 2013.
Main outcome measure Daily numbers of deaths from all causes,
cardiorespiratory diseases, and non-cardiorespiratory diseases and
among different demographic groups were used to estimate the
associations between particulate air pollution and mortality.
Results A 10 µg/m
3 change in concurrent day PM10 concentrations was
associated with a 0.44% (95% confidence interval 0.30% to 0.58%)
increase in daily number of deaths. Previous day and two day lagged
PM10 levels decreased in magnitude by one third and two thirds but
remained statistically significantly associated with increased mortality.
The estimate for the effect of PM10 on deaths from cardiorespiratory
diseases was 0.62% (0.43% to 0.81%) per 10 µg/m
3 compared with
0.26% (0.09% to 0.42%) for other cause mortality. Exposure to PM10
had a greater impact on females than on males. Adults aged 60 and
over were more vulnerable to particulate air pollution at high levels than
those aged less than 60. The PM10 effect varied across different cities
and marginally decreased in cities with higher PM10 concentrations.
Conclusion Particulate air pollution has a greater impact on deaths
from cardiorespiratory diseases than it does on other cause mortality.
People aged 60 or more have a higher risk of death from particulate air
pollution than people aged less than 60. The estimates of the effect
varied across cities and covered a wide range of domain.
Introduction
Air pollution and its negative consequences are major public
health concerns in China.1-3 According to the Global Burden of
Disease Study, a loss of 25 million healthy years and more than
1.2 million premature deaths in China were attributed to outdoor
air pollution in 2010.4 In 2012 the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development estimated that by 2050 as many
as 3.6 million people worldwide could die prematurely from air
pollution each year. Most of the deaths were estimated to occur
in China and India.5
Many time series studies conducted in Chinese cities have
consistently found that temporarily higher air pollution levels
were associated with increased mortality.6 7 A common limitation
in these studies was that the data were often from one city or
just a few cities. Most of the studies focused on heavily polluted

BMJ: first published ascities where air pollution levels were several orders of magnitude
greater than those in cities with less air pollution. Therefore,
the estimates from previous studies might be inadequate for
contributing to environmental and public health policies at the
national level. If air pollution effects are greater in more polluted
cities and national pollution control policies are set based on
estimates from these cities, the government might over-regulate
pollution, which would hinder local economic growth in cities
with less air pollution. Alternatively, if air pollution effects are
smaller in more polluted cities, the government might
underestimate the health risks and under-regulate pollution.
Most multi-city studies have focused on developed countries
where data on both health and air pollution are readily
available.8-10 Estimates from these studies have had profound
implications for developing environmental regulations designed
to protect public health in the Western world. The data from the
studies cannot be extrapolated to the Chinese population because
of considerable differences in air pollution levels, composition
of the particles, and population characteristics. In Europe and
the United States the daily PM10 (particulate matter <10 μm
diameter) concentrations range from 20 to 80 μg/m3. In China
the daily PM10 concentrations regularly exceed 500 μg/m3.
Owing to the lack of multi-city studies in China, researchers
have resorted to meta-analysis to combine estimates from
different studies.6-13 Meta-analyses based on published papers
often suffer from publication bias, and their validity has been
questioned owing to incomparability across different studies.
Firstly, positive results are more likely to be published than
negative results, leading to the censoring of studies with
statistically non-significant results.14 Secondly, heterogeneity
in study samples (eg, the difference in age structure, ICD
(international classification of diseases) codes, and study
periods) leads to different interpretations of the coefficients in
differing studies. Thirdly, the differences in study designs and
statistical methods would affect the estimated sizes of air
pollution effects, which make comparisons across different
studies difficult or even impossible.
In this study, we assembled the most recent and comprehensive
data on daily mortality and particulate matter air pollution for
38 large cities in China. For each city we then used flexible
modelling strategies to estimate the relation between PM10 and
mortality. We controlled for potential confounding factors, such
as temperature, dew point, day of the week, public holidays,
and year effects in a set of generalised linear models. Under this
research design, we were able to provide estimates of air
pollution effects for each city and to compare the estimates
across cities with different levels of PM10 concentrations,
estimate the national particulate air pollution effects using the
random effects meta-analysis, and explore the heterogeneity of
particulate air pollution effects.
Methods
Study area
We collected data on particulate matter air pollution, mortality,
and weather conditions from the 38 most populated cities in
China (see separate supplementary figure) daily from 1 January
2010 to 29 June 2013. The cities are located in 27 of the 31
provinces of China. The sampled population totals more than
200 million.
Air pollution data
Data on daily air quality were collected from the Ministry of
Environmental Protection. The ministry reported the daily air
pollution index and the primary pollutant in all the major
Chinese cities during the study period. The air pollution index
is based on the concentrations of three major air pollutants
(particles <10 μm diameter (PM10), sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen
dioxide) and provides an overall measure of ambient air quality
for each city. Supplementary material 1 in the web appendix
explains how the air pollution index is constructed and how we
were able to calculate the PM10.
Mortality data
Daily mortality data are provided by the Disease Surveillance
Point System (see supplementary material 2 in the web
appendix) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. This surveillance system collects mortality data
from certain districts in each city it covers. Mortality data
include basic demographic characteristics of the decedent and
the causes of death. The causes of death are coded according to
ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)
codes. Mortality data are classified by causes of death:
cardiovascular (I00-99) and respiratory (J00-99) diseases, and
all other diseases. For this study we had the daily numbers of
death by age, sex, and cause of death for all of the districts
covered by the surveillance system in the 38 cities.
Weather conditions data
We obtained data on daily weather conditions, such as
temperature and dew point, from local weather stations for all
38 cities in the study.
Model
We estimated the associations between PM10 and daily mortality
using a set of generalised linear models. For each city, we
estimated the associations from the equation in figure 1⇓using
daily time series data.
Meteorological factors Zi were modeled in the regressions
through a set of natural spline functions Si. The spline functions
allow flexible relations between meteorological factors and the
outcomes. We chose the degrees of freedom for each
meteorological factor (dfZi) based on its best prediction for air
pollution levels. Using degrees of freedom that best predict air
pollution levels is advantageous because they produce unbiased
or asymptotically unbiased estimates of the pollution log-relative
risk.15 The optimal degree of freedom for each natural spline
was obtained using a generalised cross validation method that
best predicts PM10 concentrations.16 After controlling for these
potential confounding factors, the data on high frequency PM10
concentrations should provide a plausible source of external
variation.
Since air pollution might affect mortality in a lagged fashion,
we examined the air pollution effects separately for different
lag structures (lag of one day, two days, etc). We also explored
heterogeneous air pollution effects by examining both sexes
and different age groups.
To estimate national air pollution effects, we conducted a
heterogeneity test and used random effects meta-analysis to
produce estimates of air pollution effects for each city. In the
meta-analysis we used the coefficients of PM10 and its standard
errors estimated from figure 2 for each city. In a random effects
meta-analysis, the true air pollution effects (βk) are assumed to
vary across different cities and to follow a normal distribution.
Such heterogeneity in air pollution effects may be caused by
differences in city populations, local socioeconomic conditions,
and baseline population health. Specifically, we assumed the
true air pollution effects were randomly and normally distributed

the variance between cities using the DerSimonian and Laird
method17 and modified the weights used to calculate the
summary estimate accordingly (fig 2⇓).
Using a set of linear regressions, we conducted exploratory
analysis on the patterns of heterogeneous air pollution effects
across the 38 cities. We investigated whether estimated air
pollution effects are associated with a city’s mean PM10
concentrations, geographical location (north or south), gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita, and several demographic
factors.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or
the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing
plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study.
No patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writing
up of results. There are no plans to disseminate the results of

community.
Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1⇓shows the daily mean PM10 concentrations, daily
number of all cause deaths, and deaths from cardiorespiratory
diseases for each city in our sample. Over the sample period (1
January 2010 to 29 June 2013), the daily mean of PM10
concentrations across all locations was 92.9 µg/m3 (SD 46.3
µg/m3). The most polluted city in our sample was Urumqi in
Xinjiang Province, with an average daily mean PM10
concentration of 136.0 µg/m3. The least polluted city was
Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province, with an average daily mean
PM10 concentration of 66.9 µg/m3. The lowest daily PM10
concentration observed in our sample was 11 µg/m3 in Changsha
on 23 September 2010, whereas the highest was 420 µg/m3 in
Nanning on 3 February 2011. On average, there were 8.6 deaths
each day in the sampled city districts, including 4.4 from
cardiorespiratory diseases. Table SM2 in the web appendix
provides more information about these cities covered by the
Disease Surveillance Point System).
Mortality and PM10 associations
We estimated the air pollution effects of concurrent day and
lagged (up to six days) PM10 concentrations on all cause deaths
by fitting the model in figure 1 to the time series data for each
city separately. Figure 3⇓is a plot of the concurrent day PM10
estimates and their 95% confidence intervals for each city. The
estimates of the effects ranged from 1.8% (95% confidence
interval 0.60% to 3.00%) per 10 µg/m3 in Yuxi to −0.98%
(−2.45% to 0.48%) per 10 µg/m3 in Panzhihua. Column 1 of
table SM3 in the web appendix presents the coefficients and
95% confidence intervals.
Although the majority of estimates were positive (87% of 38
cities), heterogeneity was obvious across the cities. The I2
statistics showed that 59% of heterogeneity between cities was
attributable to variability in the true treatment effect, rather than
to variation in sampling. Since we used the same model and
data period for all cities, heterogeneity was smaller than that in
meta-analysis using different studies. When we rejected the
hypothesis of homogeneity, we took into account the variation
identified between the cities and fitted a DerSimonian and Laird
random effects model.17 Overall, we found that a 10 µg/m3
increase in PM10 concentrations was associated with a 0.44%
(0.30% to 0.58%) increase in total mortality.
We then used different lags (one to six days) of PM10 as the
primary explanatory variable in the equation in figure 2⇓. The
forest plots of the estimates for individual cities and combined
effects are summarised in figures SM1 to SM6 in the web
appendix. Table SM4 in the web appendix reported the
coefficients and 95% confidence intervals using the order of
cities in figure 3⇓for comparison. In general, the estimates for
individual cities became smaller and the heterogeneity across
cities decreased as the lag time became longer. The combined
effects also converged to zero as the lag time became longer.
For example, for a PM10 pollution with a lag of one day, the
combined random effects estimate was 0.26% excess mortality
(0.15% to 0.37%) per 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10. The overall
effect decreased to 0.13% (0.03% to 0.23%) per 10 µg/m3
increase in lag two days PM10 pollution. The combined effects
became statistically insignificant and close to zero for PM10
lagged more than two days. Given these results, we also
estimated the air pollution effect using the three day moving
average (lags zero, one, and two). The estimates and their 95%
confidence intervals are plotted in figure SM7 in the web
appendix. The combined random effects estimate was 0.45%
excess mortality (0.28% to 0.62%) per 10 µg/m3 increase in
PM10. These estimates were quantitatively similar to those using
concurrent day PM10.
Heterogeneity by cause of death, sex, and
age group
Figures 4 and 5 show the plots for the PM10 effects for deaths
due to cardiorespiratory diseases and due to other diseases,
respectively. Columns 2 and 3 of table SM3 of the web appendix
shows the coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. We used
concurrent day PM10 concentrations for analysis of specific
diseases because the analysis for overall mortality showed that
the estimates for concurrent day pollution were similar to those
for the three day moving average. For both cardiorespiratory
diseases and non-cardiorespiratory diseases, the pollution effect
showed statistically significant heterogeneity across the different
cities. For most cities, the PM10 effect for deaths due to
cardiorespiratory diseases was more likely to be positive and
greater than deaths due to non-cardiorespiratory diseases. The
combined effect for deaths due to cardiorespiratory diseases
was more than double that for deaths due to
non-cardiorespiratory diseases. For the former, the combined
effect for all cities was 0.6% (0.43% to 0.81%) per 10 µg/m3
PM10. For the latter, the combined estimate on the effects of
PM10 was less than half (0.3% (0.09% to 0.42%) per 10 µg/m3
PM10). The I2 value for figure 4⇓was virtually the same as that
for figure 3⇓(59%), whereas that for figure 5⇓was considerably
smaller (38%). Therefore, the cities were more homogeneous
for deaths due to non-cardiorespiratory diseases than for deaths
due to cardiorespiratory diseases.
We then explored the sex and age specific effects of PM10 by
including a sex or age indicator and its interaction with PM10 in
the equation in figure 1. Figure SM8 in the web appendix plots
the estimates and 95% confidence intervals for males and
females, and their differences separately for each city. The
majority of all estimates were positive for both sexes. The
combined effect for males was 0.3% (0.16% to 0.50%) and for
females was 0.58% (0.42% to 0.74%) per 10 µg/m3. The overall
difference between males and females was 0.24% (0.10% to
0.38%). Therefore, females were more susceptible to particulate
air pollution shocks.

For people aged less than 60, the combined effect was −0.02%
(−0.19 to 0.14) per 10 µg/m3 and statistically insignificant. For
people aged 60 or more, the combined effect was 0.57% (0.40%

level. The overall difference between people aged 60 or more
and those aged less than 60 was 0.57% (0.36% to 0.78%).
Therefore, air pollution mainly affected older people in the short
term.
Air pollution effects and city specific
characteristics
We explored the relation between the estimated air pollution
effects and several characteristics specific to each city. Firstly,
we examined the association between estimated air pollution
effects and city mean PM10 concentrations. We found that the
marginal air pollution effect was smaller in more polluted cities
(figure SM10 in the web appendix). The regression result in
column 1 of table 2⇓shows that the estimated air pollution effect
would decrease by −0.13% (−0.26% to −0.01%) if mean PM10
concentrations increased by 10 µg/m3.
The estimated air pollution effects (PM10 coefficients) in figure
3 are regressedon mean PM10 concentrations (in 10 µg/m3), a
north indicator, GDP per capita (¥10 000), share of workers in
construction industry, females in population (%), share of older
population. GDP per capita obtained from city statistical
yearbooks. Demographic variables are from 2005 micro census
data. *P<0.05.
Northern China burns a lot of coal during the winter season to
provide central heating, and its weather patterns are different
from southern China. We therefore checked whether air
pollution effects differed between the north and south in our
data. Our division of the north and south followed the Huai
River line (typically the demarcation used in the literature).18
We examined the difference in PM10 between the north and
south by adding a north indicator and its interaction with PM10.
These results are presented in column 2 of table 2⇓. Figure
SM11 in the web appendix compares the relation for northern
cities with that for southern cities. We found that the marginal
effect of PM10 decreased rapidly as pollution levels increased
in southern cities. In comparison, the marginal effect of PM10
in the northern cities (sum of PM10 coefficient and the interaction
coefficient) was almost constant at different particulate air
pollution levels.
Finally, we examined the relation between the estimated air
pollution effects and several socioeconomic factors: gross
domestic product (GDP) per capita, the percentage of workers
in the construction industry, the percentage of female population,
and the percentage of people aged 60 or more. Per capita GDP
measured relative socioeconomic status across different cities.
The percentage of workers in the construction industry was used
as an alternative to pollution exposure, because construction
workers worked outside for long hours and were among those
exposed to the highest concentrations of air pollution. We
included the percentage of female population and the percentage
of people aged 60 or more because estimates revealed that air
pollution effects varied across the sexes and different age groups
for each city.
The regression result in column 3 of table 2⇓shows a positive
and statistically significant association between pollution effects
and the percentage of workers in the construction industry
(6.67%, 1.14% to 12.20%). This relation is plotted in figure
SM12 of the web appendix. We found no correlation between
GDP per capita, percentage of females, and percentage of people
aged 60 or more and particulate air pollution effects, largely
consistent with the time series findings. We conducted similar
analyses by excluding an outlier city, Urumqi, which had
particularly high PM10 concentrations, and re-estimated all the
regressions. The results were qualitatively similar to those in
table 2⇓and are reported in table SM5 in the web appendix.
Discussion
Acquiring internally coherent estimates of air pollution effects
for each city in rapidly developing countries such as China is
valuable to the cost-benefit analysis of pollution abatement
strategies and for setting standards for air quality. In this study
we estimated the associations between PM10 concentrations and
daily mortality from all causes, cardiorespiratory diseases, and
non-cardiorespiratory diseases for 38 large cities in China. We
employed a set of flexible generalised linear models to obtain
the estimates of air pollution effects. The specification of the
statistical model required a series of analytical choices, including
the specification of lag structure of the air pollution variable
and how to adjust flexibly for weather conditions.
Principal findings
Our analysis showed positive associations between daily
mortality and exposure to PM10 in most sampled cities.
Compared with a lag of one or more days for PM10 pollution,
concurrent day PM10 pollution had the largest impact on
mortality. Meta-analyses suggested that on average a 10 µg/m3
increase in concurrent day PM10, one day lagged PM10, and two
day lagged PM10, was associated with 0.44%, 0.26%, and 0.13%
increase in the daily number of deaths, respectively. We failed
to find similar positive and statistically significant effects for
air pollution lagged longer than two days. In other words,
lagging of particulate pollution had a relatively short acute effect
on mortality.
The PM10 mortality associations were substantially
heterogeneous across different cities. According to our estimates,
the effect estimates covered a wide range and included both
negative and positive domains, and PM10 concentrations were
not statistically significantly associated with mortality for half
of all cities. These findings showed the limitation of past studies
that focused on a particular city or a few large cities and were
often biased towards positive results.14 Air pollution effects were
affected by many local factors specific to each city. Results
from one city or a few cities could not be extrapolated to all
cities.
On a closer examination of heterogeneity in the PM10 effects on
mortality, we found that air pollution had a much greater impact
on deaths due to cardiorespiratory diseases than it did on deaths
due to non-cardiorespiratory diseases. Our finding was consistent
with the previous literature that patients with cardiorespiratory
diseases were more sensitive to short term deterioration in air
quality than those with other diseases. In the subgroup analysis,
we found that PM10 pollution had a greater impact on females
than on males; and that air pollution primarily affected people
aged 60 years or more.
Interestingly, the average PM10 effects from the meta-analyses
in our study were comparable to those found in several large
meta-analyses. For example, summarising 33 time series and
case crossover studies, Shang et al reported that a 10 µg/m3
increase in PM10 concentration was associated with a 0.32%
(95% confidence interval 0.28% to 0.35%) increase in deaths
not due to accidents, a 0.44% (0.33% to 0.54%) increase in

BMJ: first published asmortality due to cardiovascular diseases, and a 0.32% (0.23%
to 0.40%) increase in mortality due to respiratory diseases.7
China is a vast country with more than 1.3 billion people.
According to the World Bank, the annual total number of deaths
in China was around 9.46 million in 2010 (with a death rate of
7.11 per 1000 and total population of 1.33 billion). In our data,
the mean daily PM10 concentration across all cities was 92.9
µg/m3. A back-of-envelope calculation reveals that bringing
China’s PM10 level to the WHO standard—20 µg/m3—would
save 0.3 million premature deaths each year. This number is
likely to be a lower bound estimate of the total number of deaths
related to air pollution because the air pollution effect can be
larger in rural areas and PM10 is more detrimental to human
health in the long run. Our findings suggest that adopting and
enforcing tighter air quality standards in China will bring about
tremendous public health benefits.
Explanation of heterogeneity
The pattern of the associations between air pollution effects and
baseline PM10 level and city specific characteristics is
enlightening. Firstly, the marginal effect of particulate air
pollution was smaller in cities with more air pollution. This
could be because of the saturation effect, in which underlying
biochemical and cellular processes became saturated when
exposed to a high level of a toxic component.19 20 It is also
possible that in cities with higher air pollution, people adopted
more defensive measures, such as reducing outdoor activities,
wearing face masks, or installing air filters. As a result, despite
living in cities with more air pollution, avoidance behaviours
may have reduced people’s actual exposure. Secondly, the
particulate air pollution effects were more homogenous in
northern cities than in southern cities. This result might also
relate to avoidance behaviours. A recent study showed that
people living in northern China were more likely to buy air
filters than those living in southern China.21 Thirdly, if a city
had a larger percentage of workers in the construction industry,
then the particulate air pollution effects would be greater. A
possible explanation for the result may be that construction
workers were more likely to be exposed to air pollution. Much
of this discussion is, however, conjectural because the sample
size in this analysis was small (38 data points).
Limitations of this study
This study was limited by the air pollution data and study area.
Firstly, we were unable to examine the pollution effects of other
air pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, and
ozone owing to limitations with data. Quantification of the
health effect of other air pollutants is also important for setting
appropriate air quality standards. Secondly, we only focused on
cities, so the estimates of air pollution effects cannot be
generalised to rural areas. Air pollution, including indoor air
pollution, might have a greater impact on rural residents3.
Conclusions
This study estimated the associations between PM10 and
mortality using daily time series data from 38 Chinese cities.
Our analysis showed that PM10 was robustly associated with
worse health outcomes in most cities. We documented important
heterogeneity in the PM10 effect: PM10 had a larger impact on
people with cardiorespiratory diseases, the old population, and
the female population. The PM10effect also depended on
demographic, socioeconomic conditions in different cities.

BMJ: first published asWhat is already known on this topic
Many studies have shown a positive association between daily mortality and particulate air pollution
The air pollution effects in developed countries cannot be extrapolated to China because of differences in air pollution levels, compositions
of particles, and population characteristics
Despite immense interest in the effect of air pollution on a national scale in China, multi city analysis is rare
What this study adds
The short term effects of particulate air pollution are city specific, therefore estimates obtained from one city should not be generalised
to all cities
In China the effects of particulate air pollution are smaller in cities with more air pollution and are more homogenous in northern cities
than in southern cities

Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are widely 
used in agriculture, and several are registered 
for home garden use [U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) 2006]. In 2010, 
32 OP pesticides were registered in the United 
States (U.S. EPA 2010). In 2007, 15 mil-
lion kilograms of OP pesticides were used 
in the United States, representing 36% of 
all insecticides used (Grube et al. 2011). In 
California, 1.6 million kilograms of OP pes-
ticides were used in agriculture in 2008; the 
top five active ingredients were chlorpyrifos, 
malathion, phosmet, ethephon, and dime-
thoate [California Department of Pesticide 
Regulation (CDPR) 2010].
OP pesticides have well-known neuro-
toxic properties, with the primary mechanism 
of action involving inhibition of acetylcho-
linesterase at high doses (Sultatos 1994). At 
doses lower than those needed to inhibit ace-
tylcholinesterase, certain OP pesticides affect 
different neurochemical targets, including 
growth factors, several neurotransmitter sys-
tems, and second-messenger systems (Slotkin 
and Seidler 2007; Verma et al. 2009).
Most human studies showing adverse 
health effects of OP pesticides have been 
carried out in occupational settings with high 
exposure levels (Kamel et al. 2007). Children 
may experience chronic, low-level exposure 
due to historical home use, living near an agri-
cultural field, and residues in food (Bradman 
et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2004). Children are 
at higher risk for pesticide toxicity than are 
adults because the developing brain is more 
susceptible to neurotoxicants and the dose 
of pesticides per body weight is likely to be 
higher in children (Weiss 2000). Children 
also have lower activity and levels of enzymes 
that detoxify activated forms of certain OP 
pesticides (Holland et al. 2006).
Epidemiologic studies suggest that pre-
natal exposure to OP pesticides is associated 
with poorer neurobehavioral development in 
infants (Engel et al. 2007; Young et al. 2005) 
and toddlers and preschoolers (Eskenazi 
et al. 2007; Handal et al. 2008; Rauh et al. 
2006). Postnatal OP exposure has also been 
associated with behavioral problems; poorer 
short-term memory, executive function, and 
motor skills; and longer reaction time in chil-
dren (Bouchard et al. 2010; Grandjean et al. 
2006; Rohlman et al. 2005; Ruckart et al. 
2004). Few studies have assessed exposure 
to OP pesticides both prenatally and during 
­childhood.
The Center for the Health Assessment 
of Mothers and Children of Salinas 
(CHAMACOS) study is a birth cohort study 
investigating pesticide and other environ-
mental exposures and the health of pregnant 
women and their children living in an agri-
cultural community. Our findings suggest 
that most maternal pesticide exposure prob-
ably occurs through the diet, as is the case for 
the general U.S. population, but with addi-
tional residential nondietary exposure most 
likely from ingress of pesticides from agri-
cultural use into homes (Harnly et al. 2009; 
McKone et al. 2007). Previous reports on the 
CHAMACOS cohort suggested that prena-
tal, but not postnatal, exposure to OP pesti-
cides was associated with increased odds of 
pervasive developmental disorder and lower 
scores of mental development at 2 years of age 
(Eskenazi et al. 2007), and with poorer atten-
tion skills as well as hyperactive behaviors at 
5 years of age (Marks et al. 2010). It remains 
unclear whether cognitive deficits associated

Context: Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are neurotoxic at high doses. Few studies have ­examined 
whether chronic exposure at lower levels could adversely affect children’s cognitive development.
Objective: We examined associations between prenatal and postnatal exposure to OP pesticides 
and cognitive abilities in school-age children.
Methods: We conducted a birth cohort study (Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and 
Children of Salinas study) among predominantly Latino farmworker families from an agricultural 
community in California. We assessed exposure to OP pesticides by measuring dialkyl phosphate 
(DAP) metabolites in urine collected during pregnancy and from children at 6 months and 1, 2, 3.5, 
and 5 years of age. We administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition, to 
329 children 7 years of age. Analyses were adjusted for maternal education and intelligence, Home 
Observation for Measurement of the Environment score, and language of cognitive assessment.
Results: Urinary DAP concentrations measured during the first and second half of pregnancy 
had similar relations to cognitive scores, so we used the average of concentrations measured during 
pregnancy in further analyses. Averaged maternal DAP concentrations were associated with poorer 
scores for Working Memory, Processing Speed, Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, and 
Full-Scale intelligence quotient (IQ). Children in the highest quintile of maternal DAP concentra-
tions had an average deficit of 7.0 IQ points compared with those in the lowest quintile. However, 
children’s urinary DAP concentrations were not consistently associated with cognitive scores.
Conclusions: Prenatal but not postnatal urinary DAP concentrations were associated with poorer 
intellectual development in 7-year-old children. Maternal urinary DAP concentrations in the present 
study were higher but nonetheless within the range of levels measured in the general U.S. population.

with prenatal exposure to OP pesticides are 
persistent, because cohort studies have not 
followed children to school age, when defi-
cits may have greater implications for school 
performance. Here, we report the association 
between prenatal and postnatal exposure to 
OP pesticides, indicated by urinary dialkyl 
phosphate (DAP) metabolite concentrations, 
and cognitive abilities of 7-year-olds.
Participants and Methods
Study setting and design. The CHAMACOS 
study is a community/university partnership. 
We conducted this longitudinal birth cohort 
study of predominantly Mexican-American 
low-income families living in the Salinas 
Valley, California. This agricultural region is 
located southeast of the San Francisco Bay 
Area. Common crops include lettuce, straw-
berries, artichokes, broccoli, and grapes. About 
235,000 kg of OP pesticides were used in this 
region in 1999–2000, when study participants 
were pregnant (CDPR 2001). Current data 
show that use of OP pesticides in California 
is decreasing overall; however, use of OP pes-
ticides in Monterey County remained steady 
between 2001 and 2008 but declined 18% 
from 2008 to 2009 (CDPR 2010).
Detailed methods for the CHAMACOS 
study have been described elsewhere (Eskenazi 
et al. 2004, 2006). Briefly, pregnant women 
were recruited in six community clinics, serv-
ing primarily farmworker families, between 
October 1999 and 2000. Eligible women 
were ≥ 18 years old, < 20 weeks of gestation, 
Spanish or English speaking, eligible for low-
income health insurance, and planning to 
deliver at the local public hospital. All study 
activities were approved by the University 
of California–Berkeley Committee for the 
Protection of Human Subjects. Written, 
informed consent was obtained from the 
mothers, and child assent was obtained at 
7 years of age.
The initial cohort included 601 women 
who delivered 526 live-born surviving sin-
gletons. For the present study, we excluded 
two children with missing prenatal DAP 
concentration measurements, four children 
with a medical condition that would affect 
assessment (autism, Down syndrome, hydro-
cephalus, deafness), children who were lost 
to follow-up and/or did not participate at 
the 7-year study visit (n = 72 moved, n = 59 
refused, n = 24 unable to trace, n = 21 unable 
to schedule, n = 2 deceased), and children 
missing the cognitive assessment at the 7-year 
visit (n = 13). Families included in this analy-
sis (n = 329) did not differ significantly from 
the original full cohort on most attributes, 
including urinary DAP concentrations during 
pregnancy, maternal measures of cognitive 
ability, maternal education, marital status, 
poverty category, and child’s birth weight. 
However, mothers of children included in the 
present study were slightly older (mean age, 
26.7 vs. 26.0 years, p = 0.07) and breast-fed 
longer (8.7 months vs. 7.2, p = 0.01) than 
those from the initial cohort.
Cognitive assessment. We used the 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 
4th edition (WISC-IV), to assess cognitive 
abilities at the 7-year study visit (Wechsler 
2003). All assessments were completed by 
a single experienced bilingual psychometri-
cian, who was trained and supervised by a 
pediatric neuropsychologist. Quality assur-
ance measures included review of videotaped 
assessments. For subtests in which a ceiling 
was not achieved (< 10%), missing values were 
imputed based on scores obtained by other 
children with similar score patterns. Scores 
for four domains were calculated based on the 
following subtests: Verbal Comprehension 
(composed of the Vocabulary and Similarities 
subtests), Perceptual Reasoning (Block Design 
and Matrix Reasoning subtests), Working 
Memory (Digit Span and Letter-Number 
Sequencing subtests), and Processing Speed 
(Coding and Symbol Search subtests). All 
subtests were administered in the dominant 
language of the child, which was determined 
through administration of the oral vocabu-
lary subtest of the Woodcock–Johnson/
Woodcock–Muñoz Tests of Cognitive Ability 
in both English and Spanish (Woodcock and 
Johnson 1990). Ultimately, 67% of children 
were tested in Spanish and 33% in English. 
WISC-IV scores are standardized against U.S. 
population–based norms for English- and 
Spanish-speaking children.
The numbers of children with available 
scores were 329 for Perceptual Reasoning and 
Verbal Comprehension and 298 for Processing 
Speed and Working Memory (because we did 
not administer letter-number sequencing and 
symbol search for the first 3 months of assess-
ments). A Full-Scale intelligence quotient (IQ) 
was available for 297 children.
Maternal interviews and assessments. 
Women were interviewed twice during preg-
nancy (median gestation, 13 and 26 weeks), 
after delivery, and when children were 
6 months and 1, 2, 3.5, 5, and 7 years of 
age. Interviews were conducted in Spanish or 
English by bilingual, bicultural interviewers. 
At the 6-month visit, mothers were admin-
istered the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test 
(PPVT) to assess verbal intelligence (Dunn 
and Dunn 1981). The Infant-Toddler HOME 
(Home Observation for Measurement of the 
Environment) inventory was completed at 
6 months and 1 and 2 years of age, and a 
short version was completed at 3.5 and 5 years 
(Caldwell and Bradley 1984). Additional 
information was obtained from prenatal and 
delivery medical records, which was abstracted 
by a registered nurse.
Urinary OP metabolite measurements. 
Urine was collected at two time points during 
pregnancy. The first urine sample was collected 
at enrollment into the study, between 5 and 
27 weeks of gestation (median, 13 weeks). The 
second urine sample was collected between 18 
and 39 weeks (median, 26 weeks). Urine was 
collected from the children at 6 months and 
1, 2, 3.5, and 5 years of age; no urine was col-
lected at the 7-year visit.
Urine specimens were aliquoted and 
stored at −80°C until shipment on dry ice 
to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA) for analy-
sis. Six nonspecific OP DAP metabolites 
were measured in maternal and child urine: 
three dimethyl (DM) phosphate metabolites 
(dimethylphosphate, dimethylthiophosphate, 
dimethyldithiophosphate) and three diethyl 
(DE) phosphate metabolites (diethylphos-
phate, diethyl­thiophosphate, and diethyl­
dithiophosphate). These six metabolites cannot 
be traced back to individual pesticides but 
together represent the breakdown products 
of about 80% of the total OP pesticides used 
in the Salinas Valley (CDC 2009). The most 
commonly used OP pesticides in the Salinas 
Valley are chlorpyrifos and diazinon (which 
devolve to DE), as well as malathion and 
oxydemeton-methyl (which devolve to DM). 
DAP metabolite concentrations were measured 
using gas chromatography/tandem mass spec-
trometry and quantified using isotope dilution 
calibration (Bravo et al. 2002). Details of urine 
collection, analysis, detection frequencies, and 
quality control procedures are described else-
where (Bradman et al. 2005). Concentrations 
below the limit of detection (LOD) were ran-
domly imputed based on a log-normal prob-
ability distribution whose parameters were 
estimated using maximum likelihood estima-
tion. This method has been shown to perform 
better than simple substitution methods such 
as LOD/2 or LOD/√–2 (Lubin et al. 2004). The 
DAP metabolite concentrations were expressed 
on a molar basis and summed to yield total 
DE, DM, and DAP concentrations.
Other environmental contaminants. We 
also considered the potential confounding 
effects of other known or suspected neuro-
toxicants: polybrominated diphenyl ethers 
(PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 
p,p´-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), 
p,p´-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), 
and lead. Lead was measured in maternal blood 
at 26 weeks of gestation, in cord blood for a 
subset of the participants by the California 
Department of Public Health (Richmond, CA, 
USA), and in children’s blood at 2 years of 
age by the Monterey County Public Health 
Laboratory (Salinas, CA, USA), using graphite 
furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. 
PBDEs, PCBs, DDT, and DDE were meas-
ured by the CDC (Atlanta, GA) in maternalPrenatal exposure to organophosphates and children’s IQ

serum samples collected at 26 weeks of gesta-
tion, on average, using gas chromatography/
isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spec-
trometry and were expressed on a serum lipid 
basis. Total lipids were determined based on 
the measurement of triglyceride and total cho-
lesterol in serum using standard enzymatic 
methods (Roche Chemicals, Indianapolis, IN) 
(Phillips et al. 1989).
Data analysis. Nonspecific total DAP, DE, 
and DM metabolites (nanomoles per liter) 
were transformed to the log10 scale. All analy-
ses were conducted on non-creatinine-adjusted 
values; models were rerun with creatinine-
adjusted values (nanomoles per gram of creati-
nine) in sensitivity analyses. We examined the 
association between urinary DAP concentra-
tions and cognitive scores using multiple linear 
regression, with point estimates representing 
the change in cognitive scores for each 10-fold 
increase in DAP concentrations. For prenatal 
exposure, we examined associations with the 
DAP concentrations measured separately for 
urine collected during the first and second 
half of pregnancy (≤ 20 vs. > 20 weeks of ges-
tation). Because we found similar relations 
between cognitive scores and DAPs measured 
earlier or later than 20 weeks of gestation, we 
averaged the two DAP measures for further 
analyses; for 20 children (6%) only one pre-
natal measure was available for the analyses. 
Because DM and DE metabolites might have 
different relationships to the outcomes, they 
were examined separately.
For postnatal exposure, we examined the 
cross-sectional association of cognitive scores 
with DAP concentrations measured in chil-
dren’s urine collected at different ages in sepa-
rate models. We also calculated the cumulative 
DAP level between 6 and 60 months using 
the area under the curve (AUC), calculated 
using the trapezoidal method. For 46 children 
with one missing DAP measurement at 1, 2, 
or 3.5 years, we imputed the mean of the two 
measures closest in time for the AUC calcula-
tion. Forty-nine children who were missing 
DAP measures at either the 6-month or 5-year 
visit, or missing more than one DAP measure 
from the three other time points, were excluded 
from the AUC analysis. For comparison with 
prenatal exposure, we calculated the mean uri-
nary DAP concentrations measured during 
childhood for children with at least three of 
five measures (taken at 6 months and 1, 2, 3.5, 
and 5 years); this excluded 20 children.
To explore possible synergistic effects 
between pre- and postnatal DAP concentra-
tions, we included an interaction term for 
mean prenatal DAP concentrations × AUC. 
However, this term was not statistically sig-
nificant (p > 0.15) and thus was not included 
in the final models.
We retained the following variables as 
covariates for all analyses: maternal intellectual 
abilities (PPVT score, continuous), mater-
nal education (three categories), and contin-
uous HOME score at 6 months. Maternal 
intellectual abilities and HOME score were 
included in models because they were associ-
ated with both DAP concentrations and IQ 
scores in univariate analyses (p < 0.2), and 
maternal education was included because it is 
an important determinant of children’s cogni-
tive develop­ment. Language of testing was also 
included in models for Verbal Comprehension 
and Full-Scale IQ because of observed lan-
guage-related differences in scores for these 
scales. We conducted additional analyses to 
evaluate the confounding effect of other fac-
tors associated with neurodevelopment in the 
literature: breast-feeding duration (in weeks, 
continuous), maternal age (continuous), birth 
order (continuous), HOME score at 1, 2, 3.5, 
and 5 years (continuous), poverty category 
(coded as in Table 1), marital status (married 
or living as married/not married), children’s 
age at WISC-IV testing (in months, continu-
ous), and maternal levels of PBDEs, PCBs, 
DDE, DDT, and lead during pregnancy. Each 
of these variables was added individually to the 
final model, but none was retained because 
none changed the magnitude of the coefficient 
for urinary DAP concentrations by > 10%. In 
separate analyses, we also investigated poten-
tial confounding and effect modification by 
variables possibly on the causal pathway (i.e., 
birth weight and gestational age, assessed 
continuously). Because most children (67%) 
were tested in Spanish, we reran the analyses 
restricted to this subset. Finally, we examined 
the interaction between sex and DAP con-
centrations, based on previous findings in this 
cohort (Marks et al. 2010).
We compared effect estimates for urinary 
DAPs measured in early versus late pregnancy 
and in the prenatal versus postnatal periods 
using seemingly unrelated estimation (Weesie 
1999); we used the mean postnatal DAP con-
centrations (as opposed to AUC) for these 
analyses in order to compare metrics with 
similar units. We used generalized additive 
models with 3-degree-of-freedom cubic splines 
to evaluate the shape of dose–response curves, 
test the linearity assumption, and investigate 
potential thresholds while controlling for cova-
riates. We did not observe evidence of depar-
ture from linearity or threshold for effect, so 
we retained the simpler models based on linear 
regression. For illustration, we grouped DAP 
concentrations into quintiles, entered this 
categorical variable in the multiple regression 
model with the same covariables described 
above, and obtained the mean IQ score for 
each quintile.
Univariate and multiple linear regression 
analyses were conducted with SPSS (ver-
sion 19.0; IBM Corp., Somers, NY), and 
generalized additive model and seemingly 
unrelated estimation (“suest” command) 
were performed with STATA (version 10.1; 
StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Most women in the present study were 
Spanish speaking, were born in Mexico, lived 
in farmworker households, did not complete 
high school, and had a family income below 
the U.S. poverty threshold (Table 1); 44% 
of mothers performed agricultural work dur-
ing their pregnancy. Additional descriptive 
characteristics on this study population can 
be found elsewhere (Eskenazi et al. 2004). 
Levels of urinary DAP metabolites during 
pregnancy (mean of the two prenatal mea-
sures) were not associated with maternal edu-
cation or intelligence, family income, or the 
language of children’s cognitive assessment 
(Table 1). However, DAP levels during preg-
nancy were higher among mothers from fami-
lies with lower HOME scores (indicative of a 
less favorable home environment) at the child’s 
6-month visit (p = 0.10).
DAP concentrations in urine collected dur-
ing the first half (median, 13th week of gesta-
tion) and second half (median, 26th week of 
gestation) of pregnancy were associated with 
lower cognitive scores on all subtests in children 
at 7 years of age but were most strongly associ-
ated for Verbal Comprehension and Full-Scale 
IQ (Table 2). The effect coefficients for DAP 
concentrations measured in the first half of 
pregnancy were not significantly different from 
those for the second half of pregnancy (similarly 
unrelated regression, p > 0.05 for all scales).
Averaging the two maternal urinary DAP 
concentrations measured during pregnancy 
yielded significant associations with poorer 
cognitive scores (Table 3). Higher prenatal 
DAP concentrations were associated with 
lower scores on all four cognitive domains, 
the strongest associations being for Verbal 
Comprehension [β for a 10-fold increase in 
concentration = –5.3; 95% confidence interval 
(CI), –8.6 to –2.0]. A 10-fold increase in DAP 
concentrations was associated with a decrease 
of 5.6 Full-Scale IQ points (95% CI, –9.0 to 
–2.2). We did not observe evidence of depar-
ture from linearity in the relation between 
DAP concentrations and Full-Scale IQ. We 
found a 7.0 Full-Scale IQ–point difference 
between children in the highest quintile of pre-
natal DAP levels and those in the lowest quin-
tile (Figure 1). Urinary DM concentrations 
averaged during pregnancy were also associ-
ated with poorer cognitive scores, although 
point estimates were slightly smaller than for 
total DAP concentrations (Table 3). Urinary 
DE concentrations were associated with 
poorer cognitive score but much less strongly 
than were total DAP and DM concentrations. 
The exception was Processing Speed scores, 
which were more strongly associated withBouchard et al.

DE concentrations (β: –4.0; 95% CI, –7.0 to 
–1.0) than with DM concentrations.
We examined the confounding and effect 
modification of potential neurotoxicants (i.e., 
PBDEs, PCBs, DDT/DDE, and lead) on 
Full-Scale IQ, and none confounded or inter-
acted with the DAP prenatal measurements. 
Adjusting for postnatal urinary DAP measures 
using AUC altered the results for prenatal 
DAPs only marginally (change in estimates 
< 10%). We found no indication of sex-related 
differential associations of cognitive scores and 
prenatal DAP, DM, and DE concentrations 
(p for interaction term > 0.3). Adjusting point 
estimates for sex only marginally altered the 
results. Point estimates for creatinine-adjusted 
DAP concentrations [Supplemental Material, 
Table 1 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1003185)] were 
similar to those obtained using non-creati-
nine-adjusted concentrations. Restricting the 
analyses to children tested in Spanish yielded 
results similar to those obtained for the entire 
group [Supplemental Material, Table  2 
(doi:10.1289/ehp.1003185)].
Postnatal urinary DAP ­concentrations 
were not consistently associated with cognitive 
scores at 7 years of age (Table 4). However, 
DAP concentrations at 1 year of age were 
associated with better scores on Verbal 
Comprehension (β = 2.9; 95% CI, 0.7–5.2) 
and Full-Scale IQ (β =: 2.7; 95% CI, 0.3–5.1). 
DAP concentrations at 6 months and 2, 3.5, 
and 5 years, and cumulated throughout child-
hood by the AUC method, were not associ-
ated with cognitive scores. Likewise, postnatal 
DM and DE concentrations were not associ-
ated with cognitive scores (data not shown). 
Adjusting for prenatal urinary DAP measure 
had a negligible effect on the postnatal DAP 
results (change in estimates < 10%).
To compare the association between 
cognitive scores and DAP concentrations 
measured pre- and postnatally, we restricted 
the sample to children with measures avail-
able for both the prenatal and postnatal 
periods [Supplemental Material, Table 3 
(doi:10.1289/ehp.1003185)]. The effect coef-
ficients associated with prenatal DAP con-
centrations (mean of two measures) were 
significantly different than those associated 
with DAP concentrations measured post-
natally (mean of five measures) for Verbal 
Comprehension (p = 0.01) and Full-Scale IQ 
(p = 0.03). We observed similar findings for 
the other cognitive scales, but the difference 
between prenatal and postnatal point esti-
mates did not reach significance (p > 0.10).
Discussion
Our findings suggest that prenatal exposure to 
OP pesticides, as measured by urinary DAP 
metabolites in women during pregnancy, is 
associated with poorer cognitive abilities in 
children at 7 years of age. Children in the 
highest quintile of maternal DAP concentra-
tions had an average deficit of 7.0 IQ points 
compared with those in the lowest quintile. 
Associations were linear, and we observed no 
threshold. However, DAP concentrations 
during childhood were not associated with 
cognitive scores in this cohort of children.
Developing fetal nervous systems may 
be more vulnerable to in utero exposure to 
OP pesticides because of the many unique 
processes occurring during this stage of 
development, such as cell division, migra-
tion, differentiation, formation of synapses, 
pruning of synapses, apoptosis, and myelina-
tion (Tau and Peterson 2010). Fetal expo-
sure to OP pesticides occurs via passage of 
the OPs through the placenta (Rauh et al. 
2006; Whyatt et al. 2009). In addition, DAP 
metabolites have been detected in amniotic 
fluid (Bradman et al. 2003).
Previous reports from this cohort have 
also shown associations of prenatal but not 
postnatal OP exposure with adverse neurobe-
havioral functioning (Eskenazi et al. 2007; 
Marks et al. 2010). Our findings are con-
sistent with those of other investigations of

adverse associations between prenatal expo-
sure to OP pesticides and cognition (Harari 
et al. 2010; Rauh et al. 2006). In contrast 
to the present findings, a few other studies 
reported that OP metabolites measured in 
children were associated with poorer cognitive 
abilities (Lizardi et al. 2008; Ruckart et al. 
2004). However, these studies differed in 
exposure and/or the outcomes found to be 
associated with OP pesticides. For instance, 
Ruckart et al. (2004) examined the relation-
ship between methyl parathion—an OP pes-
ticide rarely used in the Salinas Valley—and 
found no association with general intelligence 
in 6-year-olds but did find adverse associations 
between concurrent exposure and other spe-
cific neuropsychological domains (i.e., poorer 
memory, attention, and motor skills). In a 
study of 48 children 7 years of age, Lizardi 
et al. (2008) reported that those with detect-
able levels of DAPs had a worse performance 
on a test of executive function, but not on 
the Full-Scale IQ, compared with those with 
nondetectable levels. Studies of women who 
worked in floriculture in Ecuador found asso-
ciations with certain specific neurobehavioral 
domains in their children but did not assess

general intelligence (Grandjean et al. 2006; 
Handal et al. 2007, 2008; Harari et al. 2010).
This study has limitations, mostly related 
to the assessment of exposure to OP pesti-
cides. Assessing OP exposure is challenging 
because of their fast clearance from the body, 
with complete excretion in the urine within 
3–6 days (Bradway et al. 1977). We observed 
that prenatal exposure indicated by the aver-
age of two DAP metabolite measures taken 
during pregnancy was associated with mark-
edly poorer cognitive performances. However, 
the association of DAP metabolites measured 
at one point in time during pregnancy—­
either earlier or later during gestation—was 
not as strongly associated with cognitive 
scores. Considering the rapid metabolism of 
these compounds, it seems likely that expo-
sure assessment based on a single urinary 
DAP measure is less representative of lon-
ger-term exposure than are serial measure-
ments. In addition, DAP metabolites in urine 
may in part reflect exposure to preformed 
DAPs present in the environment or food 
(Lu et al. 2005); therefore, the proportion of 
urinary DAP metabolites that reflect exposure 
to parent pesticide compounds is unknown. 
However, these sources of exposure misclas-
sification are nondifferential and would bias 
results toward the null. Despite the limita-
tions pertaining to the use of urinary DAPs 
as exposure indicators to OP pesticides, they 
may provide the best integrated measure avail-
able at this time. Indeed, for many OP pesti-
cides, no methods currently available measure 
pesticide-specific metabolites in urine or OP 
parent compounds in blood.
Prenatal exposure to OP pesticides, pri-
marily with DM rather than DE metabolites, 
was associated with poorer cognition at 2 years 
of age in this cohort (Eskenazi et al. 2007), as 
well as in the 7-year follow-up we report here. 
The exception was that DE metabolites were 
more strongly associated than DM metabo-
lites with deficits on Processing Speed. The 
stronger associations with DM metabolites for 
most cognitive measures could be explained 
by the greater toxicity of some of these OP 
pesticides. For example, oxydemeton-methyl, 
which devolves to DM metabolites, is the 
most toxic of OP pesticides used in the study 
region and represents the greatest cumulative 
risk (Castorina et al. 2003). On the other 
hand, DE metabolites may be less stable and, 
consequently, poorer exposure biomarkers 
(Bradman et al. 2007); this would likely bias 
the effect estimates toward the null.
The present study also has considerable 
strengths, perhaps most notable among them 
being its longitudinal design. We measured 
urinary DAP concentrations during prena-
tal development and throughout childhood. 
We followed children until 7 years of age, 
when the tests of cognitive function are more 
reliable than at younger ages (Honzik 1976). 
As in any epidemiologic study, the reported 
associations could be attributable to uncon-
trolled confounders, but we were able to 
examine or adjust for numerous important 
factors over the lifetime of the child, includ-
ing exposure to other environmental agents, 
several socioeconomic indicators, maternal 
cognitive abilities, and child stimulation. 
Urinary DAP concentrations during preg-
nancy were weakly associated with measures 
of socioeconomic status, such as maternal 
intelligence and education. Furthermore, the 
study population had a homogeneous socio-
economic profile, reducing the potential for 
uncontrolled confounding.
The level of urinary DAP metabolites in 
the pregnant women in the present study was 
higher than in a representative U.S. sample 
of women of reproductive age [National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) 1999–2000] (Bradman et al. 
2005). In the present group, the median 
of total maternal DAP concentrations was 
128 nmol/L. As a comparison, NHANES lev-
els were 72 nmol/L among pregnant women 
and 90 nmol/L among nonpregnant women. 
However, > 25% of pregnant women from 
the general U.S. population had DAP levels 
exceeding the median levels measured in the 
present study. Thus, the prenatal DAP con-
centrations associated with cognitive deficits 
in offspring in the present investigation were 
within the range of concentrations found in 
the general population.
Conclusion
Prenatal but not postnatal exposure to OP 
pesticides was associated with poorer intel-
lectual development in 7-year-old children 
from an agricultural community. Maternal 
urinary DAP levels in this sample, although 
higher than general U.S. levels, were none-
theless within the range of the distribution 
levels. These findings suggest that some U.S. 
women in the general population may experi-
ence OP pesticide exposure at levels that are 
associated with poorer cognitive development 
in offspring in the present study.

Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposures and Incident Cancers among Adults 
Living Near a Chemical Plant
Vaughn Barry, Andrea Winquist, and Kyle Steenland
Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA
Background: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a synthetic chemical ubiquitous in the serum of 
U.S. residents. It causes liver, testicular, and pancreatic tumors in rats. Human studies are sparse.
Objective: We examined cancer incidence in Mid-Ohio Valley residents exposed to PFOA in 
drinking water due to chemical plant emissions.
Methods: The cohort consisted of adult community residents who resided in contaminated water 
districts or worked at a local chemical plant. Most participated in a 2005–2006 baseline survey in 
which serum PFOA was measured. We interviewed the cohort in 2008–2011 to obtain further 
medical history. Retrospective yearly PFOA serum concentrations were estimated for each par­
ticipant from 1952 through 2011. Self-reported cancers were validated through medical records and 
cancer registry review. We estimated the association between cancer and cumulative PFOA serum 
concentration using proportional hazards models.
Results: Participants (n = 32,254) reported 2,507 validated cancers (21 different cancer types). 
Estimated cumulative serum PFOA concentrations were positively associated with kidney and tes­
ticular cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.24 and HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.79, 
respectively, for 1-unit increases in ln-transformed serum PFOA]. Categorical analyses also indi­
cated positive trends with increasing exposures for both cancers: for kidney cancer HRs for increas­
ing exposure quartiles were 1.0, 1.23, 1.48, and 1.58 (linear trend test p = 0.18) and for testicular 
cancer, HRs were 1.0, 1.04, 1.91, 3.17 (linear trend test p = 0.04).
Conclusions: PFOA exposure was associated with kidney and testicular cancer in this population. 
Because this is largely a survivor cohort, findings must be interpreted with caution, especially for 
highly fatal cancers such as pancreatic and lung cancer.

Introduction
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, or C8) is a 
synthetic chemical used since the late 1940s 
in manufacturing industrial and household 
products (Steenland et al. 2010). It is persis­
tent in the environment and has a long human 
half-life (Lau et al. 2007; Olsen et al. 2007; 
Seals et al. 2011). PFOA is found at low 
­levels in the serum of most people living in 
the United States, with higher levels observed 
in occupationally exposed workers (Calafat 
et al. 2007; Lau et al. 2007). Exposure sources 
in the general population are not well estab­
lished, but likely include diet, drinking water, 
food packaging, and household products (Lau 
et al. 2007). PFOA was reported to induce 
liver, testes, and pancreatic tumors in male 
rats over a 2-year period (Biegel et al. 2001). 
However, no evidence was found of hepatocel­
lular, testicular, or pancreatic tumors in male 
monkeys exposed to PFOA for 26 weeks and 
observed for 90 days after exposure (Butenhoff 
et al. 2002). Exposure levels used in the ani­
mal studies were higher than human levels 
typically seen from drinking water or occupa­
tional exposure. Because of PFOA’s potential 
for environmental persistence, long human 
half-life, and possible toxicity, there is rising 
concern about whether it might be associated 
with human cancers (U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency 2005, 2006).
The biologic mechanisms by which 
PFOA caused rat tumors, as well as the per­
tinence of the animal findings to humans, 
are unclear. PFOA activation of peroxisome 
proliferator receptors may cause liver tumors 
in rats (Kennedy et al. 2004), and also in rats, 
PFOA-induced increases in serum estradiol 
levels (Biegel et al. 2001) may have caused 
testicular tumor growth. It is not known if 
these processes are relevant to human cancer 
(DeWitt et al. 2009; Koeffler 2003; Suchanek 
et al. 2002).
Most previous human studies of the asso­
ciation between PFOA and cancer have been 
mortality studies of occupationally exposed 
workers with few cancer deaths. One study 
followed workers employed at a Minnesota 
PFOA production plant between 1947 and 
1997 (Lundin et al. 2009). These investiga­
tors reported some evidence of positive trends 
for prostate and pancreatic cancer across job 
categories with increasing PFOA exposure, 
but estimates were based on only 16 and 
13 deaths, respectively.
A second mortality study followed 
­workers who had been employed at any time 
between 1948 and 2002 at the West Virginia 
DuPont Washington Works plant consid­
ered in the present study (Leonard et al. 
2008). These authors reported that kidney 
cancer mortality was almost doubled among 
plant workers compared with other regional 
DuPont workers [standardized mortality ratio 
(SMR) = 181.0, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): = 93.5, 316.2]. Steenland and Woskie 
(2012) recently updated this study and 
reported a significant increase in kidney can­
cer mortality with increasing estimated cumu­
lative PFOA serum concentrations based on 
12 kidney cancer deaths. SMRs (95% CIs) 
by increasing exposure quartile were 1.07 
(95%  CI: 0.02,  3.62), 1.37 (95%  CI: 
0.28, 3.99), 0 (95% CI: 0, 1.42), and 2.66 
(95% CI: 1.15, 5.24) (trend test p = 0.02).
There have been two PFOA–cancer inci­
dence studies among general populations: 
Eriksen et al. (2009) and Bonefeld-Jorgensen 
et al. (2011). Eriksen et al. (2009) enrolled 
57,053 cancer-free Danish adults 50–65 years 
of age; they measured PFOA plasma con­
centrations during enrollment and followed 
participants for approximately 10 years for 
incident prostate, pancreas, liver, and blad­
der cancers. Positive associations between 
PFOA and prostate and pancreatic cancers 
were reported but were not significant, and 
no significant linear trends were seen for any 
of the four cancers. A case–control study 
of 31 breast cancer cases from the Inuit 
population (Bonefeld-Jorgensen et al. 2011) 
reported no relationship between PFOA and 
breast cancer. The unadjusted odds ratio 
(OR) was 1.07 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.31). PFOA 
­levels are typically low and widespread in 
general populations.
The DuPont chemical plant in 
Washington, West Virginia, began using 
PFOA in its manufacturing process in 1951. 
The plant released PFOA into the Ohio River

and air beginning in the 1950s, peaking in 
the 1990s, and decreasing emissions after 
2001. PFOA emitted from the plant entered 
the groundwater, which was the public drink­
ing water source.
In 2001, residents living near the plant 
filed a class action lawsuit alleging health dam­
age due to PFOA-contaminated drinking 
water. A pretrial settlement required DuPont 
to provide funding for an independent com­
munity health study called the C8 Health 
Project (C8 Health Project 2012; Frisbee et al. 
2009), and also resulted in the creation of the 
C8 Science Panel (C8 Science Panel 2012), 
which was tasked with determining whether 
there was a probable link between PFOA and 
disease in the community living near the plant.
The C8 Health Project surveyed Mid-
Ohio Valley residents in 2005–2006. The 
survey collected medical history and also 
measured serum PFOA concentrations. The 
median serum PFOA concentration in this 
population was 28 ng/mL in 2005–2006, 
compared with 4  ng/mL in the United 
States overall (Calafat et al. 2007; Steenland 
et al. 2009).
Using the C8 Health Project cohort in 
combination with a DuPont worker cohort, 
the C8 Science Panel conducted subsequent 
interviews in 2008–2011 to gather disease 
incidence data. Cancer incidence results from 
that investigation are reported here.
Methods
Data sources and study participants. The 
C8 Health Project surveyed 69,030 per­
sons between August 2005 and August 
2006. Participants were eligible if they lived, 
worked, or attended school for ≥ 1 year in one 
of six contaminated water districts near the 
plant between 1950 and 3 December 2004. 
Participants reported demographic and health 
characteristics and an extensive residential 
history. Serum was collected for PFOA mea­
surements. The estimated C8 Health Project 
participation rate was high (81% among cur­
rent residents ≥ 20 years of age) (Frisbee et al. 
2009). A detailed study description has been 
published previously (Frisbee et al. 2009).
The C8 Science Panel sought to enroll 
adult C8 Health Project participants in sub­
sequent surveys to study disease incidence, 
and 74% of the participants ≥ 20 years of 
age consented to further contact by the C8 
Science Panel. Of these, 82% participated 
in one or two surveys during 2008–2011. 
The C8 Health Project participants who com­
pleted at least one subsequent survey did not 
differ significantly from the original adult 
C8 Health Project participants with respect 
to age, sex, education, water district, or 
PFOA serum concentrations measured dur­
ing 2005–2006. They reported demographic 
information, health-related behaviors, and 
medical history. In addition, we obtained a 
list of DuPont workers who formed a cohort 
that was originally constructed for a mor­
tality study (Leonard et al. 2008; Steenland 
and Woskie 2012). This DuPont cohort was 
formed by DuPont and included 6,026 work­
ers who were employed at the Washington, 
West Virginia, plant for ≥ 1 day between 
1 January 1948 and 31 December 2002. Of 
these, we interviewed 4,391 workers, includ­
ing 1,890 who were also enrolled in the C8 
Health Project.
Figure 1 shows how the analysis cohort 
was compiled. The analysis included 32,254 
persons ≥ 20 years of age, who participated 
in at least one subsequent survey and had 
­exposure estimates.
All participants gave informed consent 
to participate, to match personal informa­
tion to state cancer registries, and to release 
medical records to study personnel. Medical 
records were protected in accordance 
with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation. The 
study was approved by the Emory University 
Institutional Review Board.
PFOA estimates. Cumulative PFOA 
serum concentration estimates were calculated 
retrospectively for each community partici­
pant for each year of life beginning in 1952 
or the participant’s birth year, whichever was 
most recent, through 2011. Estimation pro­
cedure details have been published previously 
(Shin et al. 2011a, 2011b). Estimates were 
based on historical regional data including the 
PFOA amounts emitted by the DuPont facil­
ity, wind patterns, river flow, and ground­
water flow. Exposure estimates took into 
account each participant’s reported residential 
history, drinking-­water source, tap-water con­
sumption, workplace water consumption, and 
a PFOA absorption, distribution, metabo­
lism, and excretion model.
The exposure estimates for participants 
who had ever worked at the DuPont plant 
took into account occupational exposure 
they may have received at their specific 
job. Estimated serum levels over time for 
workers in different plant jobs were based 
on over 2,000 PFOA serum measurements 
taken over time from workers (Woskie et al. 
2012). These estimates were used to create a

job–exposure matrix to estimate serum levels 
for workers across time in different jobs and 
departments. After employment ended, expo­
sure estimates decayed at a rate of 18% per 
year based on a presumed half-life of 3.5 years 
(Olsen et al. 2007). These estimates were then 
combined with estimated serum levels from 
residential exposure to contaminated drinking 
water. We estimated combined residential 
and occupational exposure for 3,713 (84%) 
of the interviewed workers.
Cancer data and confirmation process. 
Participants were asked “Have you ever been 
told by a doctor or other health professional 
that you had cancer or a malignancy of any 
kind?” Participants reported the cancer type 
and their age at diagnosis. Those reporting 
cancer were asked to allow us to review their 
medical records. For all self-reported cancers, 
we sought diagnosis validation though medi­
cal chart review or Ohio/West Virginia state 
cancer registry matching.
The Ohio state cancer registry was begun 
in 1992 and the West Virginia registry in 
1993. If a participant who self-reported a 
cancer type was found in either of the state 
cancer registries to have that cancer, we con­
firmed their cancer using the registry. We 
also sought medical records for participants 
who reported cancer and who consented for 
us to do so. Some participants who reported 
cancer were not identified in the registries 
(possibly due to living out of state or receiv­
ing a cancer diagnosis prior to 1992) and in 
these cases, we used their medical records to 
confirm self-reported cancer. Medical records 
were received from doctors the participant 
reported were relevant to the specific condi­
tion and ranged from primary care physician 
records to oncologist records. We confirmed 
cancers if there was sufficient information in 
the record. This information could include 
mention of cancer diagnosis, treatments 
received, ICD-9 [International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) (National Center for Health 
Statistics 2006)] and ICD-10 [International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related 
Health Problems, 10th Revision (World Health 
Organization 1992)] codes, or specific cancer- 
or tumor-descriptive characteristics.
Statistical analysis. Our main analyses 
were restricted to validated primary cancers. 
Participants who reported a cancer that was 
not validated were excluded from the specific 
cancer model and thus did not contribute any 
person-time to the model.
A proportional hazards regression model 
was run for each cancer type with the can­
cer as the outcome, time-varying cumulative 
PFOA serum concentration as the indepen­
dent variable, and age as the time scale. 
Participants were followed from the age of 
20 years or age in 1952 (the year after the 
first PFOA emissions), whichever was later, 
to cancer diagnosis age, last survey age, or 
death age (if deceased), whichever came first. 
Each model was adjusted for time-varying 
­smoking, time-varying alcohol consump­
tion, sex, education, and 5-year birth year 
period. We checked the proportional-hazards 
assumption for each model by including an 
exposure × age interaction, and found no vio­
lation of the proportional-hazards assumption 
(all interaction p-values > 0.05).
Our primary exposure metric was cumula­
tive PFOA serum concentration (in nanograms 
per milliliter–years), which was calculated as the 
sum of all yearly serum concentration estimates 
up to a given age. We considered models that 
included the natural log of cumulative PFOA 
serum concentration as a continuous variable 
(a test for trend), and models that included cat­
egorical variables for cumulative serum concen­
tration quartiles. The log of cumulative serum 
concentration consistently fit better than the 
linear untransformed cumulative serum con­
centration [based on the Akaike information 
criterion (AIC)], presumably because log trans­
formation diminished the influence of relatively 
sparse data with very high cumulative exposure. 
The interpretation of the log cumulative expo­
sure coefficient is that an increase of one unit 
of log cumulative exposure results in a relative 
risk (RR) of eβ compared with those with one 
unit less. We also tested for a linear trend in 
log RRs in categorical analyses by assigning the 
midpoint to each quartile and conducting a 
weighted linear regression of the log RRs on 
these midpoints.
Quartile cut points were calculated among 
the cumulative PFOA serum concentration 
estimates for the cancer-specific cases at diag­
nosis time. We also considered models that 
lagged cumulative PFOA serum concentration 
by 10 and 20 years in order to consider 
scenarios in which cancer could have been 
caused by exposure further in the past. Here 
we report the models that lagged cumulative 
PFOA serum concentration by 10 years. We 
also ran models limited to community resi­
dents who did not work at the plant in order 
to explore whether results were driven by the 
high PFOA exposure experienced by workers. 
Quartile cut points were recalculated for every 
cancer and population subgroup model.
Results
Demographic characteristics. Table 1 dis­
plays descriptive data for the 32,254 partici­
pants. Participants were, on average, 53 years 
of age at the time of their final survey, with 
male participants slightly older than female 
(54 years vs. 52 years). Most participants 
were of white race and were community 
­residents. Eleven percent had ever worked at 
the DuPont plant. Female participants were 
more likely to have some college education 
than were male participants (36% of women 
vs. 29% of men). Participants who had ever 
worked at the DuPont plant were more likely 
to be male and older at the time of interview 
compared with participants without DuPont 
work experience (80% vs. 42% and 59 vs. 
52 years of age).
Participants who had worked at the plant 
had higher PFOA serum levels in 2005–2006 
and also had higher estimated annual PFOA 
serum levels compared with participants who 
never worked at the plant (Table 2). On aver­
age, each participant contributed 33 follow-up 
years after 20 years of age but estimated serum 
levels were low prior to 1980.
Participants reported 3,589 different 
cancer diagnoses covering 21 cancer types; 
2,507 cancer diagnoses were validated (70%).

Table 3 shows the number of cancer diag­
noses reported, the number with a received 
medical record or state cancer registry entry, 
and the number validated. We obtained a 
record to review for 88% of self-reported 
cancers. Reasons for non­validation included 
living in a different state, having a cancer 
prior to the existence of the two cancer regis­
tries, or failing to consent for medical record 
review. The accuracy of self-reported cancer 
varied by cancer site. Breast, bladder, kidney, 
prostate, thyroid, colo­rectal, lung, leukemia, 
and lymphoma cancers were more likely to 
be confirmed compared with other cancer 
types. Cervical cancer had a low validation 
rate, possibly due to participants misinterpret­
ing abnormal pap smear results. Cancer was 
more often validated in DuPont worker par­
ticipants compared with community residents 
who never worked at DuPont (75% vs. 69%) 
(see Supplemental Material, Table S1).
Exposure–outcome associations. Table 4 
shows adjusted proportional hazards model 
results for each cancer type based on validated 
cases only. Thyroid, kidney, and testicular 
cancer risk increased with an increase in the 
log of estimated cumulative PFOA serum con­
centration (Table 4); this association was sta­
tistically significant only for testicular cancer 
at the p = 0.05 level. The hazard ratios (HRs) 
and 95% CIs were similar between models 
where exposure was unlagged, models where 
exposure was lagged 10 years, and models 
where exposure was lagged 20 years (results 
not shown). The models generally fit slightly 
better for unlagged exposure compared with 
10- and 20-year lagged exposures, as measured 
by AIC. Results based on all self-reported 
cancer cases were similar to estimates based 
on validated cases only (data not shown). 
The increase in testicular and kidney cancer 
risk by increasing log of estimated cumula­
tive PFOA serum concentration was stron­
ger in community residents compared with 
DuPont workers (see Supplemental Material, 
Table S2). However, the association between 
thyroid cancer risk and PFOA was positive 
and significant in DuPont workers but not 
community residents (see Supplemental 
Material, Table S2).
Table  5 reports proportional hazards 
model results for selected cancers using esti­
mated cumulative PFOA serum concentra­
tion quartiles. Estimated RRs for kidney 
cancer and testicular cancer generally increased 
monotonically across quartiles, while the pat­
tern across thyroid cancer quartiles was less 
consistent. p-Values for linear trend tests of 
log rate ratios across quartiles of unlagged 
exposures (using exposure category mid­
points, and inverse variance weighting in a 
no-­intercept linear regression model) were 
0.25, 0.18, and 0.04 for thyroid, kidney, and 
testicular cancers, respectively. The p-values 
for thyroid, kidney, and testicular cancer trend 
tests with a 10-year lag were 0.57, 0.34, and 
0.02. When stratified by occupational status, 
estimated RRs for thyroid cancer increased 
monotonically across quartiles among DuPont 
workers, but did not increase monotonically 
for kidney cancer among DuPont workers (see 
Supplemental Material, Table S3). Results for 
the worker cohort are limited by low sample 
size for cancers of interest.
Because thyroid cancer is more common 
in women, perhaps reflecting different mecha­
nisms from men, we ran separate analyses for 
men and women (24 and 74 cases, respec­
tively). Results were similar in each group 
(data not shown).
Sensitivity analyses. We conducted sev­
eral sensitivity analyses. We looked back at 
each participant’s residential history and esti­
mated the time when each participant was 
first known to have begun living or working 
in one of the six contaminated water districts, 
excluding prior time. We then considered 
survival models that started each person’s 
time on this “qualifying date,” excluding years 
before that date. These analyses resulted in 
slightly less person-time and slightly fewer 
cancer cases than original analyses; again, 
results were similar to reported results. HRs 
for a 1-unit increase in ln-transformed cumu­
lative exposure in relation to thyroid, kidney, 
and testicular cancers were 1.06 (95% CI: 
0.92, 1.23), 1.12 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.26), and 
1.37 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.90) for unlagged expo­
sures, and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.19), 1.10 
(95% CI: 0.98, 1.24), and 1.31 (95% CI: 
0.95, 1.81) for exposures lagged by 10 years.
Discussion
We estimated associations between estimated 
cumulative PFOA exposures and incident can­
cers among a group of individuals exposed to 
PFOA through drinking water or work at the 
local DuPont chemical plant. Positive associa­
tions between PFOA and cancer were found 
for kidney, testicular, and thyroid cancer.
The positive exposure–response trend for 
kidney cancer is consistent with a previous 
DuPont worker mortality analysis, which 
indicated a positive exposure–response trend

aValidated cases were limited to participants who reported the cancer and were subsequently confirmed either by 
Ohio/West Virginia cancer registry or medical record review; participants reported whether a doctor had ever told 
them they had a cancer or malignancy of any kind. bThese 3,589 cancers were self-reported by 3,292 participants; some 
­participants reported more than one cancer type. cThese 2,507 cancers are among 2,361 participants.PFOA and cancer risk among adults exposed to PFOA

for kidney cancer deaths (Steenland and 
Woskie 2012). Our findings are also in agree­
ment with an ecological study of incident 
cancer rates in relation to PFOA exposure 
levels between 1996 and 2005 in five Ohio 
and eight West Virginia counties (Vieira 
et al. 2013), which included some cancers 
diagnosed among participants in the present 
study population. They reported a significant 
positive association between kidney cancer 
and the two highest estimated PFOA serum 
exposure categories. Finally, the kidney was 
of a priori interest because studies using rats, 
mice, hamsters, rabbits, and chickens have 
shown that PFOA is distributed mainly in the 
kidneys, liver, and serum (Han et al. 2005; 
Kennedy et al. 2004; Lau et al. 2007).
Testicular cancer was of a priori interest 
because PFOA has been shown to induce tes­
ticular tumors in male rats (Biegel et al. 2001) 
and also to increase estradiol production 
in male rats, which may increase testicular 
tumor risk (Biegel et al. 2001). In the ecologi­
cal study performed by Vieira et al. (2013), 
estimated PFOA exposures were positively 
associated with testicular cancer. As noted 
above, cases included in the ecological study 
would have partly overlapped with cases diag­
nosed in our study population.
To our knowledge, there are no reports 
of an association between PFOA and thyroid 
cancer from experimental studies of animals 
or observational studies of human popula­
tions. However, there is evidence that PFOA 
is associated with incident nonmalignant thy­
roid disease in this population (Winquist and 
Steenland 2012).
We confirmed self-reported cancers 
through state cancer registry matching and 
medical record review. Our cancer valida­
tion rates for breast, prostate, lung, and mela­
noma cancers are similar to those in previous 
studies, suggesting that breast, prostate, and 
lung cancers are typically reported accu­
rately, whereas rectal cancer and melanoma 
of the skin may be reported less accurately 
(Bergmann et al. 1998; Stavrou et al. 2011). 
We tried to avoid these problems by group­
ing self-reported cases of “colon” and “rectal” 
cancer as “colo­rectal” cancer cases. Similarly, 
we did not evaluate non-melanoma skin 
cancer as an outcome and limited melanoma 
cases to participants confirmed for melanoma.
Community cohort participants 
(n = 30,431) had to be alive in 2004–2005 to 
participate in the C8 Health Project, and thus 
to be eligible for inclusion in our commu­
nity cohort. Worker cohort participants who 
were not in the C8 Health Project (1,823) 
did not have to be alive in 2004–2005 to be 
included in the study. Nevertheless, because 
of difficulties in obtaining proxy respondents 
for deceased target cohort members at time 
of interview in 2008–2011, most of the 
participants from both cohorts were alive at 
the time of their interview in 2008–2011. 
It is possible that some potentially eligible 
kidney cancer cases would not have been 
enrolled or interviewed because they died 
before 2005, given that the 5-year survival 
rate for kidney cancer based on 2002–2008 
SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and 
End Results) data was only 70% (National 
Cancer Institute 2012). In contrast, cancers 
with low fatality rates, such as thyroid and 
testicular cancer, would not be expected to 
be missing from the study cohort. If cancer 
cases with higher exposure were more likely 
to die before they could be enrolled in our 
cohort, associations with PFOA may be 
biased toward the null, particularly for highly 
fatal cancers like pancreatic cancer and lung 
cancer; consequently our results must be 
interpreted with caution. On the other hand, 
associations could be biased away from the 
null if a disproportionate number of highly 
exposed cancer cases participated in the study.
This study has several other limitations. 
PFOA was estimated individually for each 
year of each participant’s life based on their 
self-reported residential history, DuPont 
PFOA emission patterns, and a PFOA absorp­
tion, distribution, metabolism, and excre­
tion model. There is likely misclassification

aQuartiles were defined by the estimated cumulative PFOA serum concentration among the thyroid, kidney, or testicular 
cancer cases at the time of cancer diagnosis. bA proportional hazards regression model was run for each cancer;

in exposure estimates, although we did find 
good agreement between model-predicted and 
measured serum levels in 2005–2006 among 
the C8 Health Project participants who had 
never worked at the DuPont plant (r = 0.67) 
(Shin et al. 2011b). Misclassification could 
cause bias if it was differential according to 
the outcomes evaluated. Nondifferential mis­
classification is more likely to result in bias 
toward the null than away from the null, but 
not always (Armstrong 1998; Steenland et al. 
2000). Also, the cancer validation process was 
implemented only for those who self-reported 
a cancer. There could have been participants 
who had a history of cancer but did not report 
it. However, potential misclassification of 
cases as noncases would have a smaller impact 
on the analysis than misclassification of non­
cases as cases because the number of cases mis­
classified as noncases is likely small relative to 
the total number of noncases.
Conclusion
Previous research on PFOA and cancer has 
been primarily restricted to animal experi­
ments, mortality studies of male workers 
with occupational exposure, and community 
studies of populations with low exposure lev­
els and human studies have been limited by 
small numbers of cancer cases. The present 
study estimated RRs of incident cancers in 
association with cumulative PFOA exposure 
in a large community with a range of expo­
sure levels. More than 2,500 validated can­
cers covering 21 different cancer types were 
included in the analysis, making it one of the 
largest cohorts ever used to examine PFOA 
and cancer. Our findings indicate that PFOA 
exposure was positively associated with kidney 
and testicular cancer in this Mid-Ohio Valley 
population. Because this is largely a survivor 
cohort, results for highly fatal cancers must be 
interpreted with caution.

The preponderance of experimental and
human data indicates that there are persistent
and deleterious effects of blood lead levels
> 10 µg/dL on brain function, including low-
ered intelligence, behavioral problems, and
diminished school performance (Baghurst
et al. 1992; Bellinger et al. 1992; Cory-Slechta
1997; Dietrich et al. 1993; Ernhart et al. 1989;
National Research Council 1993; Needleman
and Gatsonis 1990; Pocock et al. 1994; Rice
1993; Wasserman et al. 1997; Yule et al.
1981). Lead toxicity, deﬁned as whole blood
lead ≥10 µg/dL, was based on numerous
cross-sectional and prospective studies
[Bellinger et al. 1987; Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) 1991; World
Health Organization (WHO) 1995]. These
studies generally, but not always, found
adverse consequences of childhood lead expo-
sure (CDC 1991; WHO 1995). Still, most of
the children in those studies had blood lead
levels > 10 µg/dL. The WHO and the CDC
recognized that there was no discernable
threshold for the adverse effects of lead expo-
sure, but too few studies had examined chil-
dren with blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL to
support any firm conclusions (CDC 1991;
WHO 1995).
There is emerging evidence that lead-
associated intellectual deﬁcits occur at blood
lead levels < 10 µg/dL. In the Rochester
Longitudinal Study, there was an estimated
reduction of 7.4 IQ points associated with an
increase in lifetime mean blood lead from
1 to 10 µg/dL (Canfield et al. 2003). In a
reanalysis of a Boston, Massachusetts, cohort,
a similar finding was observed among chil-
dren whose maximal blood lead level was
< 10 µg/dL (Bellinger and Needleman 2003).
Questions about an effect of lead at blood
lead levels < 10 µg/dL persist, however,
because of the relatively small numbers of
children with maximal blood lead levels
< 10 µg/dL in the Rochester Longitudinal
Study (Rogan and Ware 2003). Other studies
were limited because they involved children
whose blood lead levels may have exceeded
10 µg/dL at some point in their lifetime or
because important covariates, such as maternal
IQ scores, were not always available (Fulton
et al. 1987; Lanphear et al. 2000; Schwartz
1994; Schwartz and Otto 1991; Walkowiak
et al. 1998). Because of the policy implica-
tions of this research, it is critical to estimate
with greater precision the exposure–response
relationship at blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL.
The primary objective of this pooled analy-
sis was to estimate the quantitative relationship
between children’s performance on IQ tests
and selected measures of blood lead concentra-
tion among children followed prospectively,
from infancy through 5–10 years of age in
seven prospective cohort studies. We also
sought to test whether the lead-associated IQ
deﬁcit was greater for a given change in expo-
sure among children who had maximal blood
lead levels < 10 µg/dL compared with children
who had higher blood lead concentrations.

Lead is a conﬁrmed neurotoxin, but questions remain about lead-associated intellectual deﬁcits at
blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL and whether lower exposures are, for a given change in exposure, asso-
ciated with greater deﬁcits. The objective of this study was to examine the association of intelli-
gence test scores and blood lead concentration, especially for children who had maximal measured
blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL. We examined data collected from 1,333 children who participated in
seven international population-based longitudinal cohort studies, followed from birth or infancy
until 5–10 years of age. The full-scale IQ score was the primary outcome measure. The geometric
mean blood lead concentration of the children peaked at 17.8 µg/dL and declined to 9.4 µg/dL by
5–7 years of age; 244 (18%) children had a maximal blood lead concentration < 10 µg/dL, and
103 (8%) had a maximal blood lead concentration < 7.5 µg/dL. After adjustment for covariates,
we found an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and IQ score. Using a log-
linear model, we found a 6.9 IQ point decrement [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 4.2–9.4] associ-
ated with an increase in concurrent blood lead levels from 2.4 to 30 µg/dL. The estimated IQ
point decrements associated with an increase in blood lead from 2.4 to 10 µg/dL, 10 to 20 µg/dL,
and 20 to 30 µg/dL were 3.9 (95% CI, 2.4–5.3), 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2–2.6), and 1.1 (95% CI,
0.7–1.5), respectively. For a given increase in blood lead, the lead-associated intellectual decre-
ment for children with a maximal blood lead level < 7.5 µg/dL was signiﬁcantly greater than that
observed for those with a maximal blood lead level ≥7.5 µg/dL (p = 0.015). We conclude that
environmental lead exposure in children who have maximal blood lead levels < 7.5 µg/dL is asso-
ciated with intellectual deficits. Key words: blood lead concentration, children, environment,

and Yugoslavia (Wasserman et al. 1997). The
Sydney, Australia, study was not included
because we were unable to contact the investi-
gators (Cooney et al. 1989). The data for the
Rochester Longitudinal Study and for Mexico
City, collected when the children were about
6 years of age, have not been published else-
where. The eligibility criteria and methods for
each of the cohorts are described elsewhere
(Baghurst et al. 1992; Bellinger et al. 1992;
Canfield et al. 2003; Dietrich et al. 1993;
Ernhart et al. 1989; Schnaas et al. 2000;
Wasserman et al. 1997). All studies were
approved by their respective institutional
review boards.
Outcome measures. The primary outcome
measure was the full-scale IQ, which is a com-
posite score of verbal and performance tests.
The children were administered a version of the
Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children
[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–
Revised (WISC-R; Wechsler 1974), Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children–III (WISC-III;
Wechsler 1991), Wechsler Preschool and
Primary Scales of Intelligence (WPPSI; 1967),
and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–
Spanish Version (WISC-S; Wechsler 1981)]
under uniform conditions within each study.
The IQ test was administered when the children
were between 4 years 10 months and 7 years of
age for all but one cohort. In the Boston cohort,
we used blood lead tests taken at 5 years of age
and the nearest available full-scale IQ score,
which was done at 10 years of age.
Venous or ﬁngerstick capillary blood sam-
ples were obtained using standard protocols.
Cord blood lead was collected in a subsample
of the subjects. During each child’s examina-
tion, demographic and health information
were obtained from the parent (usually the
biologic mother). IQ tests were administered
to the mother. We also obtained data on other
factors that might confound the relation of
lead exposure and IQ, including child’s sex,
birth order, birth weight, maternal education,
maternal age, marital status, prenatal alcohol
exposure, prenatal tobacco exposure, and the
Home Observation for Measurement of the
Environment (HOME) Inventory score. The
HOME Inventory is an index that reﬂects the
quality and quantity of emotional and cogni-
tive stimulation in the home environment
(Caldwell and Bradley 1984).
Measures of exposure. We examined four
measures of blood lead: concurrent blood lead
(defined as the blood lead measured closest
to the IQ test), maximum blood lead level
(defined as the peak blood lead measured at
any time before IQ test), average lifetime blood
lead (defined as the mean blood lead from
6 months to concurrent blood lead tests), and
early childhood blood lead (defined as the
mean blood lead from 6 to 24 months). The
blood sampling intervals varied across studies.
To enhance comparability across studies, we
used the following blood sampling intervals
(based on children’s age): 6, 12 (or 15), 36, 48,
and 60 months. We used mean blood lead
rather than area under the curve (AUC) to
maintain the same units of analysis for all four
lead indices. The AUC and mean provided
essentially the same information about chil-
dren’s lead exposure (r = 0.97).
Statistical methods. To estimate the quan-
titative relationship between children’s perfor-
mance on IQ tests and selected measures of
blood lead concentration, we examined the
potential confounding effects of other factors
associated with IQ scores using multiple
regression analysis. Ten factors were available
from individual sites: HOME Inventory,
child’s sex, birth weight, birth order, maternal
education, maternal IQ, maternal age, marital
status, prenatal smoking status, and prenatal
alcohol use.
The development of the regression model
involved a multistep process beginning with a
simple unadjusted model relating each blood
lead measure to IQ while controlling for site.
The first step was to test whether the linear
model of the relationship between blood lead
and IQ, applied in most of the individual
cohort analyses, provided a good ﬁt over the
wider range of blood lead levels represented in
the pooled data. First, a linear model adjusted
for the seven sites was estimated, and then
quadratic and cubic terms for blood lead were
added to test for linearity. A restricted cubic
spline function was ﬁt to the data to produce
a curve that followed the data in the absence
of any assumptions about the functional form
of the relationship.
After an initial model was chosen, we
examined each of the 10 available confounders
individually and in combination with the
other covariates to assess potential confound-
ing of the IQ–blood lead relationship. Careful
attention was paid to the stability of the para-
meter estimates as each additional term was
added. This process was halted when either no
more signiﬁcant terms (p < 0.10) entered the
model or the inclusion of additional terms
caused no substantial change (i.e., > 10%) in
the blood lead coefﬁcient.
In all models, we tested the interaction
of blood lead and site to determine whether
a summary measure of the IQ–blood lead
relationship could be used for all cohorts.
After an initial model was selected, the tests
of linearity and the restricted cubic spline
models were recomputed to ensure that our
initial model was still appropriate after adjust-
ment for covariates (Harrell 2001). We also
produced separate linear models for each of
the seven cohorts adjusted for the covariates
selected in the combined model.
After the multiple regression models
were developed, regression diagnostics were
employed to ascertain whether the lead coefﬁ-
cient was affected by collinearity or inﬂuential
observations (Belsley et al. 1980). After regres-
sion diagnostics were examined and homo-
geneity of the blood lead coefficients across
sites was evaluated, the ﬁt of all four measures
of blood lead was compared using the magni-
tude of the model R2. The blood lead measure
with the largest R 2 (adjusted for the same
covariates) was selected a priori as the preferred
blood lead index relating blood lead to IQ.
Several approaches were investigated to
evaluate the stability of the final model.
Although the seven cohorts were not randomly
sampled from a larger population of studies, an
assumption could be made that they were rep-
resentative of a larger population of children.
Accordingly, we evaluated the results of apply-
ing a random-effects model (with sites ran-
dom) rather than a ﬁxed-effects model (Littell
et al. 1996). We also examined the effect of
any one site on the overall model by calculat-
ing the blood lead coefﬁcient in seven identical
models, each omitting one of the seven cohorts
(Efron and Tibshirani 1993).
After the ﬁnal model was selected using the
full-scale IQ as the outcome variable, we fit
similar models for verbal and performance
IQ scores. We also examined interactions of
covariates with blood lead concentration (effect
modiﬁcation) and tested the effect of including
race as a confounder in the U.S. cohort studies.
Finally, we examined the relationship of prena-
tal lead exposure (cord blood) and IQ score in
the subsample for which cord blood lead tests
were available.
Results
Of the 1,581 eligible children from the seven
cohorts, data on all 10 covariates were available
for 1,308 (83%) children; 1,333 (84%) chil-
dren had data on the four major covariates that
were selected for the final model (Table 1).
Blood lead levels were highest in Yugoslavia
and lowest in Rochester and Boston for all lead
exposure indices (Table 2). The median peak
or maximal blood lead concentration was
18 µg/dL; the mean age when children’s blood
lead levels peaked was 2.5 years. By 5–7 years
of age, the median blood level had declined to
9.7 µg/dL (concurrent blood lead concentra-
tion). The lifetime average blood lead concen-
tration was 12.4 µg/dL; 244 (18%) children
had a maximal blood lead concentration
< 10 µg/dL, and 103 (8%) had a maximal
blood lead concentration < 7.5 µg/dL.
The mean IQ of all children was approxi-
mately 93. Child IQ was highest in the Boston
cohort and lowest in the Yugoslavia cohort
(Table 2). In univariate regression analyses, chil-
dren’s IQ was signiﬁcantly related to site, mater-
nal IQ, the HOME score, maternal education,

895marital status, birth weight, maternal age, birth
order, race (for U.S. cohorts only), and pre-
natal tobacco exposure. In contrast, child’s sex
and prenatal alcohol consumption were not
significantly associated with a deficit in IQ
score (Table 3).
We examined the relationship of the four
blood lead indices with IQ (Table 4). Although
all four blood lead measures were highly cor-
related (r range = 0.74–0.96), the concurrent
blood lead variable exhibited the strongest
relationship with IQ, as measured by R 2.
Although the means differed for the different
blood lead indices, the results of the regres-
sion analyses were very similar. In all subse-
quent analyses and figures, the concurrent
blood lead measure was used as the primary
lead exposure index.
The shape of the exposure–response rela-
tionship was determined to be nonlinear insofar
as the quadratic and cubic terms for concurrent
blood lead were statistically significant (p <
0.001 and p = and 0.003, respectively). Because
the restrictive cubic spline indicated that a log-
linear model provided a good ﬁt to the data, we
used the log of concurrent blood lead in all sub-
sequent analyses of the pooled data (Figure 1).
The multivariable analysis resulted in a six-
term model: log of concurrent blood lead, site,
maternal IQ, HOME Inventory, birth weight,
and maternal education, which we consider
our preferred model (Table 4). Linear models
of concurrent blood lead and IQ are shown for
each of the seven cohorts, adjusted for the
same covariates (Figure 2). The additional six
terms we considered (child’s sex, birth order,
maternal age, marital status, prenatal smoking
status, and prenatal alcohol use) contributed
very little to the overall ﬁt of the model, and
their inclusion in the model resulted in virtu-
ally no change to the coefﬁcient for blood lead
(i.e., < 5%). None of the six terms was statisti-
cally signiﬁcant (data not shown).
The shape of the log-linear model and the
spline function indicated that the steepest
declines in IQ were at blood lead levels
< 10 µg/dL (Figures 3 and 4). The log-linear
model estimated a decrement of 6.9 IQ points
[95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 4.2–9.4] for an
increase in concurrent blood lead levels from
2.4 to 30 µg/dL, representing the 5th to the
95th percentile for blood lead values in the data
set (Table 4). But the lead-associated decrement
was greatest in the lower ranges of blood lead.
The estimated IQ decrements associated with
an increase in blood lead from 2.4 to 10 µg/dL,
10 to 20 µg/dL, and 20 to 30 µg/dL were 3.9
(95% CI, 2.4–5.3), 1.9 (95% CI, 1.2–2.6), and
1.1 (95% CI, 0.7–1.5), respectively (Table 4).
To investigate further whether the lead-
associated decrement was greater at lower blood
lead concentrations, we divided the data at two
cut-points a priori (i.e., maximal blood lead
above and below 10 µg/dL, and maximal blood
lead above and below 7.5 µg/dL) (Figure 4).
We then ﬁt separate linear models to the data
in each of these ranges and compared the blood
lead coefﬁcients for the concurrent blood lead
index. The coefficient for the 103 children
with maximal blood lead levels < 7.5 µg/dL
was signiﬁcantly greater than the coefﬁcient for
the 1,230 children with a maximal blood lead

cohort, and the IQ test was done at 10 years. Test scores of children in the Yugoslavia cohort are low because of adjustments in adapting tests where no standardization existed; rather
than deriving appropriate analogues, some culturally driven items were removed, resulting in lower scores.

HOME score was standardized to preschool test. Early
childhood blood lead concentration was defined as the
mean of 6- to 24-month blood lead tests. Lifetime average
blood lead concentration was deﬁned as the mean of blood
lead tests taken from 6 months through the concurrent
blood lead test.

to –0.71) vs. –0.16 (95% CI, –2.4 to –0.08);
p = 0.015]. The coefﬁcient for the 244 children
who had a maximal blood lead < 10 µg/dL was
not signiﬁcantly greater than the coefﬁcient for
the 1,089 children who had a maximal blood
lead ≥10 µg/dL [linear β = –0.80 (95% CI,
–1.74 to –0.14) vs. β = –0.13 (95% CI, –2.3 to

To assess the model stability, we employed
a random-effects model with sites assumed to
be randomly selected from a larger set of popu-
lations. Results were similar to the preferred
fixed-effects model, with the random-effects
model producing a blood lead coefﬁcient that
was 3.7% lower (–2.6 vs. –2.7). As an addi-
tional measure of model stability, we ﬁt seven
identical log-linear models with each model
omitting data from one of the sites. The range
of coefficients leaving one site out at a time
was –2.36 (Rochester) to –2.94 (Yugoslavia),
or a percent change ranging from –2.6 to
+8.9%. These analyses provide evidence of
the stability of our ﬁnal preferred ﬁxed-effects
model and indicate that the results of the
pooled analysis did not depend on the data
from any single study.
We also examined the relation of blood
lead concentration to verbal and performance
IQ scores, adjusting for the same covariates
used in the full-scale IQ model. The coefﬁcient
for the log of blood lead related to performance
IQ was similar to the coefficient for log of
blood lead in the full-scale IQ model (β =
–2.73 vs. –2.70), whereas the coefficient for
log of blood lead related to verbal IQ was
somewhat lower than the coefﬁcient for the log
of blood lead in the full-scale IQ model (β =
–2.07 vs. –2.70). The difference between the
coefﬁcient for verbal and performance IQ was
not statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.196).
We did not identify any signiﬁcant inter-
actions between the covariates and the log of
concurrent blood lead. In the U.S. sites, race
was not signiﬁcantly associated with IQ after
inclusion of the four covariates in the preferred
model, nor did it alter the estimated relation-
ship of blood lead concentration and IQ. In
unadjusted analyses involving the 696 children
who had cord blood lead levels, the log of cord
blood lead concentration was signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with child’s IQ (β = –1.69, SE = 0.60;
p = 0.005). After adjusting for the log of con-
current blood concentration, the log of cord
blood lead was no longer associated with chil-
dren’s IQ scores (p = 0.21). In contrast, the log
of concurrent blood lead was signiﬁcantly asso-
ciated with children’s IQ scores even with log
cord blood lead concentration in the model
(β = –1.73, SE = 0.74; p = 0.019). Finally, we
identiﬁed and removed 65 potentially inﬂuen-
tial observations from the data and refit the
model. The change in the coefﬁcient for log of
blood lead was 1.4%, from –2.70 to –2.74.
Discussion
Before 1970, undue lead exposure was deﬁned
by a blood lead level of 60 µg/dL or higher—a
level often associated with overt signs or symp-
toms of lead toxicity, such as abdominal colic,
anemia, encephalopathy, and death. Since
then, the blood lead concentration for deﬁning
undue lead exposure has been reduced: from
60 to 40 µg/dL in 1971, to 30 µg/dL in 1978,
and to 25 µg/dL in 1985 (CDC 1991). In
1991, the CDC, and subsequently the WHO
(1995), further reduced the blood lead value
defining undue lead exposure to 10 µg/dL
(CDC 1991). These ongoing reductions in the

aAdjusted for site, HOME score, birth weight, maternal IQ, and maternal education. The addition of child’s sex, tobacco
exposure during pregnancy, alcohol use during pregnancy, maternal age at delivery, marital status, and birth order did
not alter the estimate, and these were not included in the model. The estimates for the covariates in the concurrent blood
lead model were HOME score (β = 4.23, SE = 0.54), birth weight/100 g (β = 1.53, SE = 0.35), maternal IQ (β = 4.77, SE = 0.57),
and maternal education (β = 1.12, SE = 0.46).acceptable levels of children’s blood lead were
motivated by evidence showing that blood lead
concentrations as low as 10 µg/dL were associ-
ated with adverse effects, such as lower intelli-
gence (CDC 1991; WHO 1995).
In this pooled analysis, we found evidence
of lead-related intellectual deficits among
children who had maximal blood lead levels
< 7.5 µg/dL. Indeed, we found no evidence of
a threshold. Other studies reported a similar
ﬁnding, but questions about the relationship at
lower levels remained because they involved
smaller numbers of children with blood lead
< 10 µg/dL or they did not adjust for impor-
tant covariates (Canfield et al. 2003; Fulton
et al. 1987; Lanphear et al. 2000; Schwartz
1994; Schwartz and Otto 1991; Walkowiak
et al. 1998). In the pooled analysis, we esti-
mated the blood lead–IQ relationship with
data from the 5th to 95th percentile of the con-
current blood lead level at the time of IQ test-
ing, which tends to underestimate the adverse
effects of blood lead levels. For the entire
pooled data set, the observed decline of 6.2 IQ
points (95% CI, 3.8–8.6) for an increase in
blood lead levels from < 1 to 10 µg/dL was
comparable with the 7.4 IQ decrement for an
increase in lifetime mean blood lead levels from
< 1 to 10 µg/dL observed in the Rochester
Longitudinal Study (Canﬁeld et al. 2003).
Consistent with other studies (Bellinger
and Needleman 2003; Canfield et al. 2003;
Fulton et al. 1987; Lanphear et al. 2000;
Schwartz 1994; Schwartz and Otto 1991;
Walkowiak et al. 1998), the lead-associated
IQ deficits observed in this pooled analysis
were significantly greater at lower blood
lead concentrations. In a meta-analysis, the
observed decrement was greater in study
cohorts in which children with blood lead
levels < 15 µg/dL were more heavily repre-
sented (Schwartz 1994). In the Rochester
Longitudinal Study, there was an estimated
reduction of 7.4 IQ points for an increase in
lifetime mean blood lead from 1 to 10 µg/dL
(Canﬁeld et al. 2003). In contrast, IQ scores
declined 2.5 points for an increase in blood lead
concentration from 10 to 30 µg/dL (Canﬁeld
et al. 2003). The larger sample size of this
pooled analysis permitted us to show that the
lead-associated intellectual decrement was sig-
niﬁcantly greater for children with a maximal
blood lead of < 7.5 µg/dL than for those who
had a maximal blood lead of ≥7.5 µg/dL.
Although the difference in coefﬁcients associated
with the IQ decrement for children who had a
maximal blood lead concentration < 10 µg/dL
versus ≥10 µg/dL was not statistically signiﬁ-
cant, the results were consistent with the analysis
using 7.5 µg/dL as a cut-point.
We found that concurrent blood lead lev-
els or average lifetime estimates of lead expo-
sure were generally stronger predictors of
lead-associated intellectual deficits than was
maximal measured (peak) or early childhood
blood lead concentration. Although this ﬁnd-
ing conﬂicts with the widely held belief that
2-year (or peak) blood lead levels are the most
salient measure of lead toxicity, there is
increasing evidence that lifetime mean blood
lead and concurrent blood lead levels are
stronger predictors of IQ in older children
(Baghurst et al. 1992; Canfield et al. 2003;
Dietrich et al. 1993; Factor-Litvak et al.
1999). The stronger effects of concurrent and
lifetime measures of lead exposure may be
due to chronicity of exposure (Bellinger and
Dietrich 1994). Alternatively, the weaker
association with blood lead measured during
early childhood may be due to exposure mis-
classification from the greater within-child
variability of blood lead in younger children.
Nevertheless, because blood lead concentra-
tions taken in early childhood track closely
with subsequent blood lead levels (Baghurst
et al. 1992; Canfield et al. 2003; Dietrich
et al. 1993), we cannot entirely resolve the
question of whether children are more vulner-
able to lead exposure during the ﬁrst 2 years
of life. Still, young children do ingest more
lead during the first 2 years of life and may
absorb it more efﬁciently than do older chil-
dren and adults (Clark et al. 1985; Lanphear
et al. 2002; Ziegler et al. 1978). Thus, efforts
to prevent lead exposure must occur before
pregnancy or a child’s birth.
The speciﬁc mechanisms for lead-induced
intellectual deﬁcits have not been fully eluci-
dated. There are several plausible mechanisms
for the greater lead-associated intellectual
deﬁcits observed at blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL
(Lidsky and Schneider 2003; Markovac and
Goldstein 1988; Schneider et al. 2003), but it is
not yet possible to link any particular mecha-
nism with the deﬁcits observed in this pooled
analysis. Nevertheless, efforts can be taken to
reduce environmental lead exposure without
full elucidation of the underlying mechanism
(Wynder 1994).
The observational design of this study
limits our ability to draw causal inferences.
Instead, we must rely on the consistency of
findings from numerous epidemiologic and
experimental studies in rodents and nonhuman
primates, including evidence that environ-
mental lead exposure is associated with intellec-
tual deficits at blood lead levels < 10 µg/dL.
There are potential limitations of the tools we
used to measure important covariates. The
HOME Inventory was not conducted at the
same age for children in all of the sites, and the
HOME Inventory and IQ tests have not been
validated in all cultural or ethnic communities.
Nonetheless, because these covariates were
standardized and adjusted for study site, these
problems do not pose any limitations to the
interpretation of the pooled analysis results.

There are other predictors of neurodevelop-
mental outcomes that we did not examine in
this pooled analysis, such as maternal depres-
sion. The omission of unmeasured variables
may produce residual confounding (Pocock
et al. 1994). Still, in studies that did examine
other relevant covariates, such as breast-feeding
and iron status, the estimated effect of lead was
not altered appreciably (Canﬁeld et al. 2003;
Needleman et al. 1990; Tong and Lu 2000).
Finally, each of the cohorts has unique limita-
tions that raise questions about the validity and
generalizability of their ﬁndings. Nevertheless,
the results of these analyses indicate that the
results are robust and not dependent on the
data from any one site.
The impact of low-level environmental
lead exposure on the health of the public is
substantial. This pooled analysis focused on
intellectual deficits, but environmental lead
exposure has been linked with an increased
risk for numerous conditions and diseases that
are prevalent in industrialized society, such as
reading problems, school failure, delinquent
behavior, hearing loss, tooth decay, sponta-
neous abortions, renal disease, and cardio-
vascular disease (Borja-Aburto et al. 1999;
Dietrich et al. 2001; Factor-Litvak et al. 1999;
Lin et al. 2003; Moss et al. 1999; Nash et al.
2003; Needleman et al. 2002; Schwartz and
Otto 1991). Although only a few studies have
examined the association of these conditions
or diseases among individuals with blood
lead levels < 10 µg/dL (Borja-Aburto et al.
1999; Lanphear et al. 2000; Moss et al. 1999;
Schwartz and Otto 1991), the evidence is
growing.
In conclusion, the results of this pooled
analysis underscore the increasing importance
of primary prevention as the consequences of
lower blood lead concentrations are recognized.
Although blood lead concentrations < 10 µg/dL
in children are often considered “normal,” con-
temporary blood lead levels in children are
considerably higher than those found in pre-
industrial humans (Patterson et al. 1991).
Moreover, existing data indicate that there is no
evidence of a threshold for the adverse conse-
quences of lead exposure. Collectively, these
data provide sufficient evidence to eliminate
childhood lead exposure by banning all
nonessential uses of lead and further reducing
the allowable levels of lead in air emissions,
house dust, soil, water, and consumer products
(Lanphear 1998; Rosen and Mushak 2001).

Summary
Background Exposure to ambient air pollution increases morbidity and mortality, and is a leading contributor to 
global disease burden. We explored spatial and temporal trends in mortality and burden of disease attributable to 
ambient air pollution from 1990 to 2015 at global, regional, and country levels.
Methods We estimated global population-weighted mean concentrations of particle mass with aerodynamic 
diameter less than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) and ozone at an approximate 11 km × 11 km resolution with satellite-based 
estimates, chemical transport models, and ground-level measurements. Using integrated exposure–response 
functions for each cause of death, we estimated the relative risk of mortality from ischaemic heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and lower respiratory infections 
from epidemiological studies using non-linear exposure–response functions spanning the global range 
of exposure.
Findings Ambient PM2·5 was the fifth-ranking mortality risk factor in 2015. Exposure to PM2·5 caused 4·2 million 
(95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·7 million to 4·8 million) deaths and 103·1 million (90·8 million 115·1 million) 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2015, representing 7·6% of total global deaths and 4·2% of global DALYs, 
59% of these in east and south Asia. Deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 increased from 3·5 million (95% UI 
3·0 million to 4·0 million) in 1990 to 4·2 million (3·7 million to 4·8 million) in 2015. Exposure to ozone caused an 
additional 254 000 (95% UI 97 000–422 000) deaths and a loss of 4·1 million (1·6 million to 6·8 million) DALYs from 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2015.
Interpretation Ambient air pollution contributed substantially to the global burden of disease in 2015, which increased 
over the past 25 years, due to population ageing, changes in non-communicable disease rates, and increasing air 
pollution in low-income and middle-income countries. Modest reductions in burden will occur in the most polluted 
countries un­less PM2·5 values are decreased substantially, but there is potential for substantial health benefits from 
exposure reduction.

Introduction
Exposure to ambient air pollution increases mortality 
and morbidity and shortens life expectancy.1,2 The Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2015 (GBD 2015) estimated the burden of disease 
attributable to 79 risk factors in 195 countries from 
1990 to 2015. GBD 2015 identified air pollution as a 
leading cause of global disease burden, especially in low-
income and middle-income countries.3 In view of the 
important role of public policy in mitigating this risk and 
the potential for substantial health benefits related to 
efforts to reduce emissions of climate-forcing agents, we 
explored spatial and temporal trends in mortality and 
burden of disease attributable to ambient air pollution 
from 1990 to 2015 at global, regional, and country levels.
Methods
Overview
Attributing deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs) to ambient air pollution requires spatially and 
temporally resolved estimates of population-weighted 
exposure, specification of a theoretical minimum risk 
exposure level (TMREL), estimation of relative risks across 
the exposure distribution, and estimates of the deaths and 
DALYs for diseases linked causally to air pollution. We 
combined estimates of exposure and relative risk to 
estimate the population-attributable fraction (PAF), the 
proportion of deaths and DALYs attributable to exposure 
above the TMREL. The numbers of deaths and DALYs for 
specific diseases were multiplied by the PAF to estimate 
the burden attributable to exposure. A more general

description of the methods used to estimate the PAF and 
attributable burdens in GBD 2015 has been reported 
previously;3 here, we present details specific to air pollution.
GBD 2015 extended the methods and datasets used in 
GBD 2013 to estimate the burden of disease attributable to 
ambient air pollution for 1990–2015.4,5 Estimates of 
exposure to ambient air pollution were updated with 
additional air pollution measurements and improved 
estimation methods,3,6 relative risk estimates were updated 
using more recent epidemiological studies and refined 
statistical estimation techniques,3 and new methods were 
developed and applied to identify key drivers of global 
trends in the burden of disease attributable to ambient air 
pollution. The GBD 2015 estimates update the entire time 
series beginning in 1990, so the changes in methodology 
affect the estimates for each year in the 1990–2015 interval 
and supersede estimates previously released.
Estimation of exposure
Air pollution is a complex mixture of gases and particles 
whose sources and composition vary spatially and 
temporally. Population-weighted annual mean concen­
trations of particle mass with aerodynamic diameter less 
than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) and tropospheric ozone are the 
two indicators used to quantify exposure to air pollution. 
PM2·5 is the most consistent and robust predictor of 
mortality in studies of long-term exposure.7,8 Ozone, a 
gas produced via atmospheric reactions of precursor 
emissions, is associated with respiratory disease 
independent of PM2·5 exposure.9,10 We estimated exposure 
to PM2·5 and ozone for the global population at spatial 
scales relevant to human exposure (appendix pp 2–4).3,6 
Global annual mean exposure to PM2·5 was estimated 
in 5-year intervals from 1990 to 2015, at 0·1 × 0·1° 
(~11 km × 11 km at the equator) resolution using estimates 
from satellites combined with a chemical transport 
model, surface measure­ments, and geographical data. 
We aggregated gridded exposure concentrations to 
national-level population-weighted means using the 
corresponding grid cell population value.11 National-level 
population-weighted mean concentrations and the 
95% uncertainty interval (95% UI) around this mean 
were estimated by sampling 1000 draws of each grid cell 
value and its uncertainty distribution.
As in previous assessments,4,5 we used a chemical 
transport model to calculate a running 3-month mean 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Literature reviews done by the US Environmental Protection 
Agency, WHO, and others have shown that long-term exposure 
to ambient air pollution increases mortality and morbidity from 
cardiovascular and respiratory disease and lung cancer and 
shortens life expectancy. Based on this evidence, the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 
estimated the burden of disease attributable to 79 risk factors, 
including ambient air pollution, in 195 countries and territories 
from 1990 to 2015. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study 2015 identified air pollution as a leading 
cause of global disease burden, especially in low-income and 
middle-income countries.
Added value of this study
In this Article, we show the crucial part played by broad 
demographic and epidemiological trends. We estimated that 
long-term exposure to ambient fine particle air pollution (PM2·5) 
caused 4·2 million deaths and 103·1 million lost years of healthy 
life in 2015, representing 7·6% of total global mortality, making it 
the fifth-ranked global risk factor in 2015. Exposure to ozone was 
responsible for an additional 254 000 deaths. Although global 
rates of mortality due to PM2·5 exposure decreased from 1990 to 
2015, the absolute numbers of attributable deaths and 
disability-adjusted life-years increased because of rising levels of 
pollution and increasing numbers of deaths from 
non-communicable diseases in the largest low-income and 
middle-income countries in east and south Asia, where 
populations are growing and ageing. This research places the 
burden of disease as a result of ambient air pollution within the 
context of other common potentially modifiable risk factors at a 
national level, helping to prioritise air pollution from a population 
health perspective. In the analysis of trends in the burden of 
disease caused by ambient air pollution, we show where, and the 
extent to which, ambient air pollution is changing as a contributor 
to disease burden, and the extent to which the trends in the 
attributable burden reflect progress, or absence of it, in reducing 
exposure versus changes in demographic factors. In so doing, we 
were able to elucidate the challenges that must be overcome to 
reduce the public health effects of exposure to air pollution.
Implications of all the available evidence
Ambient air pollution was a leading risk factor for the global 
burden of disease in 2015 and has remained stable, and its 
contribution to the global burden of disease has remained 
relatively stable, from 1990 to 2015. Trends in attributable 
deaths reflect both demographic and epidemiological trends 
and increasing levels of air pollution in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Should these trends continue, they 
will lead to increasing burdens if major reductions are not made 
in pollution levels. Non-linear exposure–response functions 
suggest modest reductions in burden in the most polluted 
countries unless PM2·5 levels markedly decline. As a result, the 
challenges for future reductions in the burden of disease 
attributable to air pollution are substantial. International 
experience has shown that exposure to ambient air pollution 
and its associated burden of disease can be lowered for entire 
populations via policy action at the national and subnational 
levels via aggressive air quality management programmes, 
focused on major sources of air pollution.

(of daily 1 h maximum values) ozone concentration for each 
grid cell over 1 year, from which we selected the maximum 
of these values, consistent with epidemio­logical studies 
that use a seasonal (summer) mean, while accounting for 
global variation in the timing of the ozone (summer) 
season. We estimated population-weighted mean ozone 
concentrations and 95% UIs for each country as described 
for PM2·5, assuming a normal distribution with a 95% UI 
within 6% either side of the estimated mean concentration.
Theoretical minimum risk exposure level
TMREL was assigned a uniform distribution of 
2·4–5·9 µg/m³ for PM2·5 and 33·3–41·9 parts per billion 
for ozone, bounded by the minimum and fifth percentiles 
of exposure distributions from outdoor air pollution 
cohort studies (appendix pp 7, 11–14). The uniform 
distribution represents the uncertainty regarding adverse 
effects of low-level exposure.3,12,13
Risk estimation
We estimated the burden attributable to PM2·5 for 
ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease 
(ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke), lung cancer, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 
lower respiratory infections (LRI), and the burden 
attributable to ozone for COPD.3,14 Evidence linking these 
diseases with exposure to ambient air pollution was 
judged to be consistent with a causal relationship on 
the basis of criteria specified for GBD risk factors.3
We developed integrated exposure–response functions 
(IERs) for each cause of death to estimate the relative risk 
of mortality over the entire global range of ambient 
annual mean PM2·5 concentrations using risk estimates 
from studies of ambient air pollution, household air 
pollution, and second-hand smoke exposure and active 
smoking (appendix pp 8–14).12,14 IERs assign con­
centrations of PM2·5 to each type of exposure on an 
equivalent µg/m³ basis assuming that risk is determined 
by the 24-h PM2·5 inhaled dose regardless of the exposure 
source, consistent with previous findings.15,16 We updated 
IERs from those used in GBD 2013 by adding additional 
risk estimates for air pollution (appendix pp 11–14) 
and active smoking.17 An alternative method to estimate 
exposure to second-hand smoke was used that incor­
porated estimates of PM2·5 attributable to exposure per 
cigarette, breathing rate, and number of cigarettes 
smoked in the country where each study was done. 
Further details are provided in the appendix (pp 8–14).

Curves show the central estimate of the integrated exposure–response (solid lines) and their 95% uncertainty intervals (shaded areas). The relative risk equals 1 for 
PM2·5 concentrations of 0–2·4 µg/m³ (ie, lower bound of the theoretical minimum risk exposure level uncertainty distribution). Additional details are provided in the

The IER has the mathematical form: 
where z is the level of PM2·5 and zcf is the TMREL, below 
which no additional risk is assumed, with
if z is greater than zcf and zero otherwise. Here, 1 + α is 
the maximum risk, β is the ratio of the IER at low to high 
concentrations, and γ is the power of PM2·5 concentration.
Epidemiological evidence suggests that the relative risks 
for IHD and stroke decline with age.18 We modified the 
particulate matter source-specific relative risk for both 
IHD and stroke mortality as described by Burnett and 
colleagues12 and applied this age modification to the relative 
risks, fitting the IER model for each age group separately. 
Observed relative risks were related to the IER within a 
Bayesian framework using the STAN fitting algorithm, 
as described in the appendix (pp 15–17). Given the true 
values of the four parameters (α, β, γ, zcf), we assumed 
that the logarithm of each study’s observed relative risk 
was normally distributed, with mean defined by the IER 
and variance given by the square of the observed SE of 
the study-specific log-relative risk estimate plus an 
additional variance term for each of the four sources on 
PM2·5 exposure (outdoor air pollution, second-hand 
smoke, household air pollution, and active smoking). 
Details regarding model fitting and code are provided in 
the appendix (pp 15–17).
We calculated 1000 predicted values of the IER for each 
PM2·5 concentration based on the posterior distributions 
of (α, β, γ) and the prespecified uniform distribution of 
TMREL to characterise uncertainty in the estimates of 
the IER. The mean of the 1000 IER predictions at each 
concentration was used as the central estimate, with 
uncertainty defined by 95% UIs.
We estimated the relative risk of COPD mortality from 
ozone exposure using a linear exposure–response function 
for respiratory mortality from Jerrett and colleagues.10 
Additional details are provided in the appendix (p 14).
Estimation of PAF and burden
We calculated DALYs and deaths attributable to ambient 
air pollution by applying the year-specific, location-
specific, age-specific, and sex-specific PAF to the 
numbers of DALYs and deaths, as described in detail 
elsewhere.19,20 PAF estimation methods are summarised 
in the appendix (pp 20–21).

higher values. We fit age-specific functions for IHD 
and cerebrovascular disease, and estimated decreasing 
relative risks as age increased from 25 years to 80 years.
Global population-weighted PM2·5 increased by 11·2% 
from 1990 (39·7 µg/m³) to 2015 (44·2 µg/m³), increasing 
most rapidly from 2010 to 2015 (figure 2). Among the 
world’s ten most populous countries, exposures since 2010 
increased in Bangladesh and India and were stable but 
remained high in Pakistan and China. Exposures decreased 
substantially in Nigeria and were low and slightly decreased 
in the USA, Brazil, and Russia. Population-weighted 
concentrations were low and stable in Japan and Indonesia.
The highest estimated population-weighted mean con­
centrations in 2015 were for Qatar (107·3 µg/m³), 
Saudi Arabia (106·2 µg/m³), and Egypt (104·7 µg/m³), 
followed by Bangladesh (89·4 µg/m³), Mauritania 
(85·1 µg/m³), Libya (79·2 µg/m³), Nepal (75·0 µg/m³), 
and India (74·3 µg/m³). The population-weighted mean 
PM2·5 in China was 58·4 µg/m³, with provincial 
population-weighted means ranging from 19·1 µg/m³ to 
79·3 µg/m³. The lowest estimated population-weighted 
means were in several Pacific island nations and 
territories (Kiribati, American Samoa, Samoa, Tonga, 
Solomon Islands, Fiji, and Guam), Brunei, Sweden, 
Greenland, New Zealand, Australia, Finland, Iceland, 
Liberia, and Canada (all ≤8·0 µg/m³).
Population-weighted ozone levels increased by 7·2% 
globally from 1990 (56·8 parts per billion [ppb]) to 2015 
(60·9 ppb). Within the world’s ten most populous 
countries, increases of 14–25% were noted in China, 
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Brazil, with smaller 
increases in Japan and negligible changes in Russia and 
Nigeria (data not shown). Decreases in population-
weighted concentrations were noted in the USA (5·2%; 
from 70·2 ppb to 66·5 ppb) and Indonesia (12·9%; from 
50·2 ppb to 43·7 ppb).
Long-term exposure to PM2·5 contributed to 4·2 million 
(95% UI 3·7 million to 4·8 million) deaths and to a loss 
of 103·1 million (90·8 million to 115·1 million) DALYs in 
2015, representing 7·6% of total global deaths and 4·2% 
of global DALYs, which is an increase from 1990. In 2015, 
ambient PM2·5 was the fifth-ranked risk factor for global 
deaths and sixth-ranked risk factor for DALYs among the 
risk factors included in GBD 2015 (figure 3). DALYs 
attributable to long-term exposure to PM2·5 consisted of 
99·2 million (95% UI 87·7 million to 111·0 million) years 
of life lost and 3·9 million (2·6 million to 5·2 million) 
years lived with disability in 2015.
Household air pollution from solid fuel use was

106·1 million) DALYs in 2015. Together, ambient and 
household air pollution were estimated to have caused 
6·4 million (5·7 million to 7·3 million) deaths in 2015. 
Mortality from cardiovascular disease (IHD and 
cerebrovascular disease) accounted for most deaths and 
DALYs attributable to ambient PM2·5 air pollution 
(figure 4; table 1). Ambient PM2·5 air pollution contributed 
to 17·1% of IHD, 14·2% of cerebrovascular disease, 
16·5% of lung cancer, 24·7% of LRI, and 27·1% of COPD 
mortality in 2015 according to GBD compare.21 
Age-standardised death and DALY rates due to 
exposure to PM2·5 were higher in males than females 
(table 1), as a result of higher all-cause mortality rates in 
males (1018·6 per 100 000 males vs 703·4 per 
100 000 females21). They were also higher in elderly 
people (age >70 years) than in children (age <5 years; 
table 1), mainly because of age-related differences in 
mortality from non-communicable diseases (41·4 per 
100 000 children aged 1–5 years vs 2914·4 per 
100 000 adults aged 70–74 years21). Ambient PM2·5 
contributed to 202 000 (95% UI 152 700–254 600) deaths 
and 17·4 million (13·1 million to 21·9 million) DALYs 
from LRI in children younger than 5 years. 
Deaths attributable to long-term exposure to PM2·5 in 
2015 varied substantially among countries (figure 5). 
South and east Asia contributed 59% of the 4·2 million 
global deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 in 2015 
(1·36 million deaths [95% UI 1·19 million to 1·56 million] 
in south Asia and 1·14 million deaths [0·97 million to 
1·31 million] in east Asia). In World Bank high-income 
countries, exposure to ambient PM2·5 contributed to 4·3% 
of total deaths in 2015 versus 9·0% in upper-middle-
income, 8·7% in lower-middle-income, and 4·9% in low-
income countries. These differences in attributable 
mortality mostly reflect the fraction of total deaths from 
cardiovascular disease among countries.3 The highest 
age-standardised rates of death due to PM2·5 exposure 
were in southern Asia (133·4 per 100 000 population, 
95% 
UI 
114·2–152·6), 
central 
Asia 
(85·2 
per 
100 000 population, 72·0–98·9), and eastern Asia 
(83·2 per 100 000 population, 70·4–95·6). Rates in high-
income North American (USA, Canada, and Greenland; 
17·8 per 100 000 people [95% UI 13·6–22·9]), Asian 
(18·7 per 100 000 people [14·6–23·7]), and western 
European countries (19·9 per 100 000 [15·9–24·8]) were 
four to eight times lower (appendix pp 26–1078).

attributable deaths and DALYs: 52% and 50% of the 
respective global totals. Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh 
had the highest age-adjusted mortality rates, more than 
seven times higher than those of Japan and the USA 
(table 2; appendix pp 26–1078).
Global mortality due to ambient PM2·5 increased from 
1990 to 2015. Attributable deaths rose from 3·5 million 
(95% UI 3·0 million to 4·0 million) in 1990 to 3·8 million 
(3·3 million to 4·3 million) in 2000, and 4·2 million 
(3·7 million to 4·8 million) in 2015 (figure 4). However, 
age-standardised PM2·5 mortality rates decreased from 
65·6 per 100 000 people (95% UI 56·9–74·9) in 1990 to 
57·5 per 100 000 people (50·2–64·8) in 2015.
Trends in PM2·5-attributable mortality among countries 
largely reflect changes in PM2·5-attributable mortality from 
cardiovascular disease (appendix pp 24, 26–559). In World 
Bank high-income countries, the all-age proportion of 
PM2·5-attributable cardiovascular disease deaths decreased 
from 10·0% to 8·1% as a result of reductions in 
cardiovascular mortality and decreasing levels of PM2·5. By 
contrast, in World Bank low-income countries, it increased 
from 13·1% to 13·2%, and in lower-middle-income 
countries from 15·9% to 16·5%, between 1990 and 2015.
Trends in PM2·5-attributable mortality at the global and 
national levels reflect the influence not only of changing 
air quality, but also of demography and underlying 
mortality rates. We calculated the contribution of changes 
in each of four factors—population growth, population 
ageing, age-standardised rates of mortality (IHD, 
cerebrovascular disease, COPD, lung cancer, and LRI), 
and exposure to ambient PM2·5—to the net change in 
mortality attributable to ambient PM2·5 between 1990 and 
2015 globally and for the ten most populous countries 
(appendix pp 22–23). Figure 6 shows the changes in 
mortality attributable to ambient PM2·5 from 1990 to 2015 
according to the contributions of these four factors. Age-
standardised mortality decreased in all ten countries, with 
Nigeria, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the USA 
also experiencing decreases in exposure. These decreases 
were offset by increases in population growth and 
population ageing in most countries. Consequently, net 
increases in attributable mortality were noted in all 
countries except Nigeria and the USA. In China, India, 
Bangladesh, and Japan, increases in exposure combined 
with increases in population growth and ageing resulted 
in net increases in attributable mortality. In Brazil, 
Russia, Indonesia, and Pakistan, despite decreasing 
exposure, population growth (except in the case of Russia) 
and the ageing of the population led to a net increase in 
attributable mortality. In the USA, reductions in exposure 
offset increases in population and ageing, leading to a net 
decrease in attributable burden.

rates at the subnational level for China, the USA, and

several other countries. When these data were combined 
with PM2·5 exposures estimated globally at fine (0·1 × 0·1°) 
resolution, we were able to estimate subnational burden 
attributable to PM2·5 exposure. In China, where ambient 
PM2·5 contributed to 1·1 million (95% UI 1·0 million 
to 1·8 million) deaths in 2015, the provincial-level 
PM2·5-attributable age-standardised rates varied by more 
than three times, from 132·1 deaths per 100 000 people 
(95% UI 97·6–172·0) in Qinghai to 40·6 deaths per 
100 000 people (30·2–50·4) in Hong Kong. In the USA, 
where ambient PM2·5 contributed to 88 400 (95% UI 
66 800–115 000) deaths in 2015, state-level PM2·5-attributable 
age-standardised death rates also varied by about three 
times, from 27·1 deaths per 100 000 (95% UI 21·2–34·1) 
in Mississippi to 8·1 deaths per 100 000 (5·1–11·7) 
in Hawaii.
Exposure to ozone contributed to 254 000 (95% UI 
97 000–422 000) deaths globally and a loss of 4·1 million 
(1·6 million to 6·8 million) DALYs from COPD in 2015. 
In 2015, ambient ozone was the 34th-ranked risk factor 
for global deaths and 42nd-ranked risk factor for DALYs 
among the 79 risk factors assessed in GBD 2015. 
Exposure to ozone contributed to an estimated 8·0% 
(95% UI 3·0–13.3) of global COPD mortality in 2015, 
with China, India, and the USA experiencing some of the 
highest mortality rates (figure 7A; appendix pp 1079–1362). 
The ozone-attributable COPD mortality rate increased in 
many countries from 1990 to 2015. Global deaths and 
DALYs attributable to ozone exposure increased from 
1990 to 2015, as a result of increases in both levels of 
ozone and COPD mortality (figure 7B; appendix 
pp 1079–1362).
Discussion
In this Article, we present, to our knowledge, the most 
comprehensive assessment so far of the global status 
and trends in the burden of disease attributable to 
ambient air pollution, highlighting the crucial part 
played by broad demographic and epidemiological 
trends. Estimation of spatially resolved trends over a 
25-year period and assessment of the contributions of 
exposure and epidemiological and demographic factors 
to the attributable disease burden provides important 
insights for the development of policies to reduce the 
health effects of air pollution. These estimates are made 
in the context of assessment of burden attributable to 
other risk factors, allowing for direct comparisons and 
priority setting.
We estimated that long-term exposure to ambient 
PM2·5 caused 4·2 million deaths and 103·1 million lost 
years of healthy life in 2015, and exposure to ozone 
caused an additional 254 000 deaths. PM2·5 caused an 
estimated 7·6% of total global mortality in 2015 and was 
the fifth-ranking global mortality risk factor. Although 
global rates of mortality due to PM2·5 exposure decreased

from 1990 to 2015 as a result of improved air quality in 
high-income countries and declining mortality rates for 
cardiovascular diseases, the absolute numbers of 
attributable deaths and DALYs increased as a result of 
increases in pollution and the absolute numbers 
of deaths from non-communicable diseases, especially 
in China and India, where populations are both growing 
and ageing. Household air pollution from the burning 
of solid fuels is also a major cause of mortality in low-
income and middle-income countries, and together 
with ambient air pollution poses a substantial public 
health challenge. 
Absolute numbers of attributable deaths and DALYs 
were higher in GBD 20153 than estimated in GBD 2013.4 
These differences are mainly a result of changes in the 
underlying disease burden estimates3 and to updates to 
the IER (appendix pp 8–14), which estimated higher 
relative risks in 2015 than in 2013 for IHD, 
cerebrovascular disease, LRI, COPD, and lung cancer. 
National-level population-weighted exposure estimates 
also increased between GBD 2013 and GBD 2015 
(appendix pp 2–6). Because of the updated data and 
methods described earlier, we consider the current 
estimates to be more accurate.
Our results assume that the toxicity of ambient PM2·5 
depends only on the magnitude of concentration, but 
not on the source, such as coal burning or vehicular 
emissions, or chemical composition, which vary among 
and within countries.22,23 However, despite substantial 
effort, neither epidemiological nor toxicological research 
has identified particular sources or components that 
uniquely determine the toxicity of the PM2·5 mixture, 
and therefore the evidence does not support the 
development and application of source-specific relative 
risk functions for burden estimation.15,16 This issue 
remains an active area of research and is a source of 
uncertainty in our estimates.
In the past few years, other researchers have estimated 
the burden of disease due to air pollution using different 
data and methods. Recent estimates from WHO24 of 
3·0 million deaths in 2012 used the same exposure 
estimates as presented here, but an earlier (GBD 2013) 
version of the IER and somewhat different baseline 
disease burden estimates. Lelieveld and colleagues25 
analysed source sector contributions to air pollution and 
the resulting disease burden in 2010 and estimated the 
burden in 2050. These estimates used an older (GBD 2010) 
IER. 
Furthermore, 
the 
coarse 
spatial 
resolution 
(~100 × 100 km) of the exposure estimates introduced 
errors via spatial misalignment between exposure and 
population density compared with our estimates.
As in any assessment of this scope, this study has 
limitations. Since the GBD will be regularly updated, we 
anticipate enhancements to the methodology in the 
future to address them. First, we have probably 
underestimated the complete burden of disease 
attributable to air pollution. Although the causes of 
mortality we included make up four of the five leading 
global causes of death in 2015,3 findings from systematic 
reviews in the past 10 years have shown that PM2·5 
exposure is also associated with low birthweight and 
preterm birth,26 asthma,9 and type 2 diabetes.27 Future 
updates of GBD estimates will consider these other 
causes of mortality and morbidity should they meet GBD 
inclusion criteria.
Second, our estimate of the importance of ambient 
PM2·5 assumes that exposure does not affect the 
prevalence of other mortality risk factors. However, if 
long-term exposure to PM2·5 causes high blood pressure, 
then some amount of the PM2·5 burden would be 
mediated by its effect on high blood pressure. Mediation 
analysis was used in GBD 2015 to more accurately 
apportion the burden attributable to other risk factors 
such as diet and high blood pressure, but an absence of 
longitudinal studies precludes such analyses for 
ambient PM2·5.3
Third, because large-scale cohort studies of PM2·5 and 
mortality are absent in the most polluted countries, the 
IERs were developed to estimate the effects of exposure 
at levels above those observed in air pollution cohort 
studies done in the USA, Canada, and western Europe, 
but the magnitude of the excess relative risk from PM2·5 
exposure at high levels of PM2·5 remains uncertain. In 
Chinese cohort studies from the past 5 years, other 
metrics were used, such as total suspended particles 
and PM10,28,29 and findings from a few analyses that 
converted these metrics to PM2·5 suggest that the IERs 
provide reasonable estimates of effects at high levels of 
ambient pollution.12,30
Fourth, although we included estimates of the effect of 
seasonal ozone exposure on COPD mortality, less 
evidence is available for this relationship than that 
linking PM2·5 with COPD or the other causes of mortality. 
However, a causal link between increased COPD 
mortality and long-term exposure to ozone is, in our 
view, supported by a large body of evidence linking ozone 
exposure mortality to adverse effects on the respiratory 
system, including chronic changes in lung structure and 
function in human beings and non-human primates, 
and increased morbidity and mortality from COPD due 
to short-term and long-term exposure, especially in the 
warmer seasons.10,31,32
In conclusion, ambient air pollution contributes 
substantially to the global burden of disease, which 
has increased over the past 25 years, as a result of 
both demographic and epidemiological trends and 
increasing levels of air pollution in low-income and 
middle-income countries. Should these trends continue, 
major reductions in pollution levels will be needed to 
avoid increases in disease burden. Moreover, the non-
linear IERs imply modest reductions in burden in the 
most polluted countries unless PM2·5 concentrations 
decline markedly.3,33,34 As a result, the challenges for 
future reductions in the burden of disease attributable toArticles

air pollution are substantial. For example, using earlier 
attributable burden estimates and future mortality 
predictions, Apte and colleagues33 estimated that air 
pollution levels in 2030 in China would need to decline 
by 29%, and those in India by 20%, to maintain 
per-person mortality at 2010 levels, although the 
economic35 and public health benefits of even 
incremental reductions would probably be substantial in 
view of the large populations affected.34 Exposure to 
ambient air pollution and its associated burden of 
disease can potentially be lowered for entire populations 
via policy action at the national and subnational levels. 
As the experience in the USA suggests,36 changes in 
ambient PM2·5 associated with aggressive air quality 
management programmes, focused on major sources23 
of air pollution including coal combustion, household 
burning of solid fuels, and road transport, can lead to 
increased life expectancy over short timeframes.

Abstract
Outdoor air pollution is a major contributor to the burden of disease worldwide. Most of the global 
population resides in places where air pollution levels, due to emissions from industry, power 
generation, transportation and domestic burning, considerably exceed the World Health 
Organization’s health-based air quality guidelines. Outdoor air pollution poses an urgent 
worldwide public health challenge because it is ubiquitous and has numerous serious adverse 
human health effects including cancer. Currently, there is substantial evidence from studies of 
humans and experimental animals, as well as mechanistic evidence to support a causal link 
between outdoor (ambient) air pollution, and especially particulate matter (PM) in outdoor air,

Introduction
Outdoor air pollution is a major contributor to the burden of disease worldwide.1 Most of the 
global population currently resides in places where air pollution levels, due to emissions 
from major sources such as industry, power generation, transportation and domestic burning, 
considerably exceed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) health-based air quality 
guidelines. This report presents an overview of outdoor air pollutants, sources and global 
levels, as well as a description of epidemiological evidence linking outdoor ambient air 
pollution with lung cancer incidence and mortality, followed by studies of other types of 
cancers in adults as well as childhood cancers, and biological mechanisms of air pollution-
derived carcinogenesis. This report concludes by summarizing public health/policy 
recommendations, including multi-level interventions aimed at the individual, community, 
and regional scales. The specific role for the medical and healthcare community regarding 
prevention and advocacy, and recommendations for further research are also described.
Sources and Levels of Outdoor Air Pollution
Exposure to outdoor air pollution poses an urgent public health challenge worldwide 
because it is ubiquitous, affecting everyone, and has numerous serious adverse human health 
effects including cancer.2 Major primary air pollutants, those emitted directly into the 
environment largely as a result of combustion of fossil and biomass fuels, include gaseous 
pollutants (such as sulfur dioxide: SO2, nitrogen dioxide: NO2, carbon monoxide: CO, and 
volatile organic compounds: VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) (including carbonaceous 
aerosol particles, such as black soot). While CO is often low outdoors in the developed 
world today (due to the use of emissions controls such as catalytic converters on 
automobiles), high levels can be experienced near biomass burning sources, including 
wildfires.3 In addition, secondary air pollutants are formed in the atmosphere from primary 
pollutants, and include gaseous ozone (O3), a major component of photochemical smog, 
formed in the atmosphere when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbons such as VOCs

and nitrate (e.g., ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3)) aerosols are commonly created in the 
atmosphere from SO2 and NOx, respectively. Primary combustion particles and secondary 
particles are small in diameter, and are often referred to as fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 
(particles ≤ 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter). Submicron combustion-related PM2.5 are of 
particular health concern because they contain numerous toxic compounds (e.g., acids and 
heavy metals) and can penetrate deeper into the lung than the larger PM generated by natural 
processes, such as most windblown soil particle mass.4
Air pollutants are emitted and/or formed both outdoors and indoors, resulting in personal 
pollutant exposure levels that can differ from levels measured by routine ambient air 
pollution measurements at centrally located air monitoring stations. The most common 
health-related air pollutants of greatest concern are summarized in Table 1 and are 
categorized into three classes: 1) pollutants primarily emitted into the outdoor environment; 
2) pollutants primarily emitted into the indoor environment; and, 3) pollutants emitted into 
both outdoor and indoor environments. These pollutants and their typical sources are noted, 
including: PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO. Subsequent discussions herein will focus on 
outdoor air pollutants that are associated with cancer, especially PM and its constituents.
PM represents a broad class of chemically and physically diverse aerosols comprised of 
solid particles or liquid droplets suspended in the air. Such aerosols can be characterized by 
their size (discussed below), formation mechanism, origin, chemical composition, 
atmospheric behavior and method of measurement. The concentration of particles in the air 
varies across space and time and reflects the source of the particles and the pollutant 
transformations that occur in the atmosphere. PM air pollution can also be viewed in two 
major components: “primary” PM, including “soot” emitted directly into the atmosphere by 
combustion pollution sources such as industry, electric power plants, diesel buses, and 
automobiles, and; “secondary” PM, formed in the atmosphere from primary gaseous 
pollutants, such as SO2 and NOx gases (discussed above). Other primary sources include 
non-exhaust traffic emissions and windblown dusts from roadways, construction sites, 
agriculture, and deserts. Desert dust clouds have been documented to be capable of 
impacting population centers by being transported long distances.5
PM is commonly characterized according to the following size fractions:
•
PM10 (PM ≤ 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter) are the largest inhalable particles. 
Particles larger than 10 μm are generally not inhaled past the trachea, and are 
caught in the nose and throat, and not deposited in the lung. PM10 also includes 
all the fractions described below;
•
PM2.5–10, also known as coarse fraction particles (PM with an aerodynamic 
diameter > 2.5 μm, but ≤ 10 μm); and
•
PM2.5, also known as fine particles (PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 
μm), can be inhaled into the deepest recesses of the lung, including to the alveoli 
sacs, where oxygen exchange to the bloodstream occurs. As such, PM2.5 has 
increasingly become a major research focus of adverse human health impacts of 
outdoor air pollution exposure over recent decades.

The smallest fraction of PM2.5 are nanoparticles, also known as ultrafine 
particles (UFPs), generally defined as particles ≤ 0.1 μm in aerodynamic 
diameter.
The mass concentration (as μg/m3) is the common metric used to evaluate and regulate PM 
pollution, though some constituents, such as lead (Pb) concentration, have been separately 
regulated. While UFPs usually make up only a small fraction of PM2.5 mass, UFPs 
commonly account for a majority of the number concentration of particles in PM2.5. It has 
been hypothesized based on toxicological studies that UFPs may be an especially toxic 
component of PM2.5 because of their small size, large numbers, and large surface area to 
mass ratio, but epidemiological evidence is currently sparse.6
PM2.5 is directly emitted from combustion sources, and is also formed from gaseous 
precursors, such as SO2 and NOx, or organic compounds (discussed above). In some areas 
and under some conditions, these secondary particles make up a substantial proportion of the 
PM2.5 mass. Secondary fine particles are commonly composed of sulfate, nitrate, chloride 
and ammonium compounds, organic carbon, and condensed metals. Combustion of fossil 
fuels, and especially coal, further results in PM2.5 that is highly enriched in multiple 
moderately volatile, and potentially toxic elements. These include the chalcophile elements 
such as zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), molybdenum (Mo), and cadmium (Cd).7 
Indeed, coal combustion has been found to account for approximately one-quarter of the 
world’s emissions of both As and mercury (Hg).8,9 PM2.5 can remain in the atmosphere for 
days to weeks, and travel through the atmosphere hundreds to thousands of kilometers;5 
conversely most coarse particles typically deposit to the earth within minutes to hours and 
travel within only tens of kilometers from the emission source.
The global population-weighted mean annual average PM2.5 concentration was 46 μg/m3 in 
2017, four-fold greater than the WHO’s health-based world air quality guideline of 10 μg/m3 
(Figure 1).10 Ninety-two percent of the global population worldwide lives in areas where 
ambient PM2.5 concentrations exceed the WHO guideline and large percentages of the 
populations of China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nigeria have exposures above the 
WHO’s highest interim target guideline of 35 μg/m3. Among the ten largest countries by 
population, population-weighted ambient PM2.5 in 2017 varied by more than 12-fold; from 7 
μg/m3 in the United States to 91 μg/m3 in India. For NO2, global population-weighted mean 
concentrations were estimated to be 1.6 ppb during 1996–2012, and were observed to have 
increased by 0.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6–1.1) per year during that time.11 Areas 
with the highest population-weighted mean concentrations were high-income Asia Pacific 
(4.9 ppb), Western Europe (4.1 ppb), and high income North America (3.7 ppb), though 
there was a decreasing trend ranging from 2.1 to 4.7% per year. Population-weighted mean 
concentrations in East Asia were 2.9 ppm and increasing at the highest rate of 6.7% per year. 
In contrast, population-weighted mean concentrations in areas of South and Southeast Asia, 
Africa, and the Caribbean were ≤ 0.5 ppb. The global population-weighted mean O3 
concentration worldwide was 57 ppb in 2017, unchanged from 1990.10

some aspect of the association of outdoor air pollution and cancer, here we sought to 
highlight key contributions including meta-analyses and large-scale original studies, with a 
focus on the most recent and informative published literature. Methodological 
considerations and research needs are also discussed.
Epidemiological Studies of Outdoor Air Pollution and Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is the leading cause of 
cancer death, with an estimated 2.1 million new cases and 1.8 million deaths occurring in 
2018, representing 11.6% of all new cancer diagnoses and 18.4% of all cancer deaths.12 In 
the United States, approximately 234,030 new lung cancer cases occurred and 154,050 
deaths were estimated in the same year.13 Lung cancer is highly fatal, with an overall 5-year 
survival rate of only 18%.13 Rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality vary substantially 
within and between countries, depending largely on historical patterns of cigarette smoking,
12 with long latency periods of up to approximately 30 years between the start of the 
smoking epidemic and the rise of lung cancer incidence. The highest incidence rates for lung 
cancer among men are currently observed in Micronesia/Polynesia, Eastern Asia, and 
Eastern Europe, and for women in North America, Northern and Western Europe, and 
Australia/New Zealand.12 In several European countries, lung cancer incidence rates are 
beginning to converge in men and women as increasing rates in women are approaching 
declining rates in men.12
Although cigarette smoking accounts for more than 80% of lung cancers, substantial 
numbers of lung cancer cases are observed among never smokers. Outdoor ambient air 
pollution and exposure to other inhalable agents, such as household burning of solid fuels, 
residential radon, second hand tobacco smoke, asbestos, certain metals and organic 
chemicals, and work in rubber manufacturing, paving, roofing, painting, or chimney 
sweeping, and other occupational exposures have also been associated with lung cancer risk.
12–14
Based on sufficient evidence in studies of humans and experimental animals, as well as 
strong mechanistic evidence, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 
2013 classified both outdoor air pollution and PM in outdoor air pollution as Group 1 human 
carcinogens for lung cancer.15 The IARC evaluation noted that general population cohort 
studies with quantitative data on long-term estimates of outdoor air pollution exposure, 
including the large-scale American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-
II) and the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE), were 
particularly informative in their evaluation with a broad range of exposures considered and 
detailed information on potential confounders, notably cigarette smoking.16–18 Because the 
possibility of residual confounding by cigarette smoking of reported air pollution effects had 
remained a concern, the analysis of thousands of never-smokers in the ACS CPS-II study, 
which observed increased lung cancer mortality associated with long-term PM2.5 exposure, 
was particularly influential.17 Interestingly, the IARC conclusion of a causal link between

Author Manuscriptoutdoor air pollution and PM in outdoor air with increased lung cancer risk was long ago 
foreshadowed, given the presence of carcinogens in ambient air. Indeed, in the introduction 
to their landmark report on the preliminary findings of their case-control study of lung 
cancer in London, Doll and Hill19 commented: “Two main causes have from time to time 
been put forward: (1) a general atmospheric pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars, from 
the surface dust of tarred roads, and from gas-works, industrial plants, and coal fires; and (2) 
the smoking of tobacco.” In the ensuing 70 years, the dominance of tobacco smoking as a 
cause of lung cancer perhaps distracted attention away from the role of outdoor air pollution 
as another avoidable cause.
IARC has also classified household burning of coal as a Group 1 human carcinogen and 
household burning of biomass fuel as a Group 2A (probably carcinogenic) for lung cancer.
20,21 Household burning of solid fuels, both coal and biomass, contribute significantly to 
high levels of outdoor air pollution and hence burden of disease in low- and middle-income 
countries.22–25
Meta-analysis of findings from 14 studies of outdoor air pollution conducted largely in 
North America and Europe reported a statistically significant 9% (95% CI 4–14%) increase 
in risk for lung cancer incidence or mortality per each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 
concentrations and in 9 studies of PM10, an 8% (95% CI 0–17%) increase in risk per 10 
μg/m3.26 Lung cancer incidence and mortality were considered together here, since due to 
the highly fatal nature of the disease, mortality is considered a valid indicator of incidence. 
Although significant heterogeneity in findings by continent was not observed, there were 
few studies conducted in Asia or other regions of the world. Findings were also generally 
similar by exposure assessment method, among studies using either fixed site monitoring or 
model-based indicators of outdoor air pollution exposure, as well as by covariate adjustment 
for cigarette smoking or other sociodemographic variables. In an even more recent updated 
meta-analysis of findings from 20 cohort studies, a somewhat larger increase in lung cancer 
incidence or mortality (i.e., 14%, 95% CI 8–21% per 10 μg/m3 PM2.5) was observed with 
similar findings again in studies from different regions (Figure 2).27 When extrapolated to 
the global population-weighted mean annual average PM2.5 concentration (46 μg/m3) 
relative to the WHO’s health-based world air quality guideline (10 μg/m3), this represents an 
approximately 60% excess risk of lung cancer mortality.
There were also significant adverse associations in meta-analyses of studies of NO2 
exposure, a marker of traffic-related air pollution, for lung cancer mortality (relative risks 
(RRs) of 1.04 to 1.05 per 10 μg/m3), although results were attenuated somewhat in studies 
that adjusted for individual-level cigarette smoking status and were no longer significant.
28,29 Additional research in Asia and in other understudied and more highly polluted regions 
is needed,27 as well as with improved data on individual and lifetime outdoor air pollution 
exposures, including time-varying estimates of outdoor air pollution exposures over long 
time periods and consideration of individual and residential mobility over time.
Results from several recent large-scale epidemiological studies also showed adverse 
findings. There was a significant adverse association of ambient PM2.5 and lung cancer 
mortality among 635,539 United States National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)

cancer deaths).30 There were suggestive adverse associations of both PM2.5 and PM10 with 
lung cancer mortality in analysis of 49,564 participants in the Danish Diet, Cancer and 
Health Cohort but no associations with black carbon, NO2, or O3.31 However, there was no 
clear association of PM2.5, PM10, or NO2 and lung cancer mortality among Dutch national 
health survey participants (n = 339,633), possibly due to the short follow-up or other 
methodological characteristics of this study.32 Among studies without individual-level 
information on cigarette smoking history, in analysis of ~4.9 million individuals in the 
Ontario Population Health and Environment Cohort (ONPHEC), there were significant 
adverse associations of both ambient PM2.5 (HR per 5.3 μg/m3 = 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.05) 
and NO2 (HR per 14 ppb = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–1.07) but not O3 or Ox (combined oxidant 
capacity of NO2 and O3) and incident lung cancer.33 In analysis of 18.9 million United 
States Medicare beneficiaries, there were significant adverse associations particularly with 
longer-term moving average PM2.5 exposure and lung cancer mortality (HR per 10 μg/m3 60 
month moving average = 1.33, 95% CI 1.24–1.40).34 There were also some significant 
adverse associations with O3 and NO2.35,36 Although analysis extended to 53 million 
Medicare beneficiaries reported no association of PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality, there 
may be confounding by cigarette smoking status in rural populations included here.37
Worldwide, ambient PM2.5 air pollution was estimated to have contributed to 265,267 lung 
cancer deaths (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 182,903–350,835) in 2017, or 14.1% (UI 9.8–
18.7) of all lung cancer deaths.1 The global proportion of lung cancer deaths attributable to 
ambient PM2.5 was second only to tobacco smoking (14.1% vs. 63.2%)1.
Mortality attributable to PM2.5 depends not only on patterns in ambient pollutant levels, but 
also on other factors including underlying population dynamics, ageing, mortality rates, 
access to health care and other racial and socioeconomic disparities38 and as such, the 
number of estimated attributable lung cancer deaths has increased by nearly 30% since 2007. 
These factors may also explain, at least in part, the wide variation in country-specific 
estimates. Age-standardized PM2.5-attributable lung cancer mortality rates and population-
attributable fractions in the United States for example were 1.6/100,000 (UI 0.65–2.91) and 
4.7% (UI 1.9–8.5) compared to 7.4/100,000 (UI 5.4–9.5) and 20.5% (UI 14.8–25.9) in China 
(Figure 3).
Despite such major advances in knowledge surrounding associations of outdoor air pollution 
and lung cancer, additional questions remain. For example, less is known regarding 
associations for specific histologic types of lung cancer, of relevance to treatment and 
prognosis, an area of active investigation with regard to tobacco smoking. The increasing 
risk of adenocarcinoma over the last four decades is considered as reflecting changes in 
cigarettes and the delivery of carcinogens.39 A mechanistic basis for a link of air pollution to 
particular histological types is uncertain though some studies have suggested stronger 
findings with adenocarcinoma. In the meta-analysis of Hamra et al.26 results for both PM2.5 
and PM10 were somewhat stronger for adenocarcinoma (RRs per 10 μg/m3 = 1.40, 95% CI 
1.07–1.83 and 1.29, 95% CI 1.02–1.63 respectively), though there were few studies. Among 
more recent work, in an analysis of 89,234 women in the Canadian National Breast 
Screening Study, there was a significant adverse association of PM2.5 and incident lung

for both small cell carcinoma (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 0.93–2.53) and adenocarcinoma (HR = 
1.44, 95% CI 1.06–1.97).40 In analysis of 80,285 participants in the Adventist Health and 
Smog Study-2, there was a significant adverse association of PM2.5 and total lung cancer 
incidence (HR per 10 ug/m3 = 1.43, 95% CI 1.11–1.84).41 There was also an adverse 
association with adenocarcinoma (HR = 1.31, 95% CI 0.87–1.97) which strengthened in 
participants reporting spending >1h/day outdoors.42 There was also an adverse association 
of ambient PM10 concentrations and total lung cancer incidence in the EAGLE study, 
consisting of 2,099 cases and 2,120 controls in the Lombardy Region of Italy (odds ratio 
(OR) per 10 μg/m3 = 1.28, 95% CI 0.95–1.72) with somewhat stronger findings for 
squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 1.44, 95% CI 0.90–2.29).43 In a large-scale South Korean 
study, including 6,567,909 participants from a National Health Insurance database, there was 
no overall association of either PM10 or NO2 concentrations and incident lung cancer but an 
adverse association of PM10 and adenocarcinoma in male smokers (HR > 60.9 vs < 50.40 
μg/m3 = 1.14; 95% CI 1.03–1.25).44 Further research on air pollution and lung cancer by 
histological type is needed.
Knowledge regarding effects of differing PM components for lung cancer is also limited.
26,45 In analysis of 669,046 ACS CPS-II participants, there was a significant adverse 
association of total PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality (HR per 10 ug/m3 = 1.09, 95% CI 1.03–
1.16), as well as with both near source (largely traffic-related) and regional PM2.5 
components.46 There were also stronger lung cancer mortality associations in the ACS CPS-
II with coal combustion-related PM2.5 as well as with Se, a coal combustion tracer, and S 
elemental components specifically.47 In an analysis of 193,300 participants in the Canadian 
Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) there were significant adverse 
associations of glutathione- but not ascorbate-related PM2.5 oxidative burden (the product of 
PM2.5 mass and oxidative potential (the ability of regional filter extracts to deplete 
antioxidants glutathione or ascorbate in a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid)) and lung 
cancer mortality.48 In an analysis of 2.6 million CanCHEC participants, associations of total 
PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality were similar by spatial climatic zone.49 The ESCAPE study 
of 245,782 participants from 14 cohorts reported elevated RRs for incident lung cancer risk 
associated with various PM2.5 or PM10 components, particularly for S (long-range transport, 
secondary combustion-related components) and nickel (Ni) (oil-burning, industry).50 IARC 
also concluded that there is sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of diesel 
engine exhaust, as well as some PM constituents (e.g., Ni, chromium (Cr), Cd, silica dust) 
for lung cancer.51,52 There was also sufficient evidence in experimental animals for the 
carcinogenicity of condensates of gasoline engine exhaust.51 Therefore while limited, the 
strongest evidence to date implicates fine PM of fossil fuel combustion origins.
There is also limited information regarding modification of outdoor air pollution 
associations by other individual or lifestyle factors. Hamra et al.26 reported that associations 
with PM2.5 were somewhat stronger among former smokers (RR = 1.44, 95% CI 1.04–2.01) 
and never smokers (RR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.00–1.39) than in current smokers (RR = 1.06, 95% 
CI 0.97–1.15). However, few studies have examined possible joint effects of air pollution 
and cigarette smoking on an additive scale, which may be most relevant for public health. In 
analysis in the ACS CPS-II, there was some evidence for an interaction between ambient

exposures greater than what was expected from the sum of the effects of both exposures 
alone.53 It was estimated that 14% (95% CI 0–25%) of lung cancer deaths in that study were 
attributable to the interaction between these two factors. The ESCAPE lung cancer study 
reported no interaction between ambient PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations and fruit 
consumption.18 Future studies with individual-level information on potential confounding 
and modifying factors, including cigarette smoking and diet, captured over time are needed.
Finally, ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with poorer lung cancer survival, 
particularly early-stage non-small cell cancers, among 352,053 California lung cancer 
patients.54 There was also an adverse association of long-term exposure to PM2.5 and first 
hospital admission for lung cancer in a cohort of 11 million Medicare beneficiaries in the 
South-Eastern United States, indicating a potential association with exacerbation of disease.
55 Further research is needed to better understand the impact of outdoor air pollution on 
patterns of morbidity and mortality following lung cancer diagnosis.
Epidemiological Studies of Outdoor Air Pollution and Other Types of 
Cancer
Epidemiological evidence for associations of outdoor air pollution with other types of cancer 
than lung is more limited, although adverse associations have been reported in an increasing 
number of studies. Previous studies are typically limited by small numbers of cancer cases, 
the use of fatal rather than incident disease endpoints (particularly relevant for cancers with 
more favorable prognoses), the use of recent as opposed to historical estimates of long-term 
outdoor air pollution concentrations, as well as some conflicting findings. Outdoor air 
pollution might cause cancer at sites other than the lung through absorption, metabolism, 
and distribution of inhaled carcinogens.
Following lung cancer, the subsequent leading causes of cancer diagnoses worldwide 
include female breast cancer (11.6%), prostate cancer (7.1%), and colorectal cancer (6.1%).
12 For mortality, cancer of the colorectum (9.2%), stomach (8.2%), and liver (8.2%) account 
for the next greatest numbers of cancer deaths.12 In addition to lung cancer, cigarette 
smoking is also considered an IARC Group 1 carcinogen for cancers of the oral cavity, nasal 
cavity, pharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colorectum, pancreas, liver/bile 
duct, kidney, renal pelvis/ureter, bladder, ovary, cervix, and myeloid leukemia with limited 
evidence for other types of cancer, such as breast cancer.21 Second hand tobacco smoke has 
also been suggestively associated with many of these types of cancer.39
Other inhalable pollutants have also been associated with multiple types of cancer. A meta-
analysis of household air pollution from burning of solid fuels also noted adverse 
associations with oral, cervical, and esophageal cancer.56 Occupational exposure to various 
agents have also been associated with cancer at different sites, including for example diesel 
and gasoline exhaust, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), inhalable dusts (metals, silica), or 
work in trucking, mining, foundries, carbon black production, or work with asphalt.

Author ManuscriptThe IARC evaluation noted that beyond lung cancer, some adverse associations with outdoor 
air pollution were observed for bladder cancer in studies using different metrics of exposure 
to outdoor air pollution, traffic, or occupation as a surrogate indicator of exposure.15 Bladder 
cancer shares several risk factors with lung cancer. However, results from more recent 
studies are mixed. In analysis of 623,048 ACS CPS-II participants, there was a significant 
adverse association of PM2.5 and bladder cancer mortality (HR per 4.4 μg/m3 = 1.13, 95% 
CI 1.03–1.23, n = 1,324) but no association with NO2 or O3.61 There was also a significant 
adverse association of PM2.5 and bladder cancer mortality in the NHIS (HR per 10 μg/m3 = 
1.48, 95% CI 1.00–2.20, n = 589).30 Although an early hospital-based study of 1,219 
incident bladder cancer cases and 1,271 controls in Spain reported an adverse association of 
living more than 40 years in a city of > 100,000 inhabitants and bladder cancer risk (OR = 
1.30, 95% CI 1.04–1.63),62 an updated analysis including estimates of ambient PM2.5 and 
NO2 at the participant residence based on European land-use regression models, showed no 
clear association.63 There was also no association of ambient PM10, PM2.5–10, PM2.5, PM2.5 
absorbance, NO2, NOx, other elemental PM components, organic carbon, or traffic density 
with bladder cancer incidence in the ESCAPE study.64
Previous studies have suggested some adverse associations of both NO2 and NOx and breast 
cancer, with fewer clear associations with PM.65 Among most recent studies, in analysis of 
47,433 women in the United States Sister Study there were adverse associations of both 
NO2 (HR per 5.8 ppb = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.11) and PM2.5 (HR per 3.6 μg/m3 = 1.05, 95% 
CI 0.99–1.11) and breast cancer incidence overall (n = 2,848).66 There were also adverse 
associations of PM2.5 concentrations characterized by low S and high sodium (Na) and NO3- 
fractions and invasive breast cancer incidence in California participants, and of PM2.5 
characterized by high fractions of silicon (Si), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), and aluminium 
(Al) among participants in the Western United States. There were also adverse associations 
of several non-metallic air toxics, including methylene chloride and breast cancer incidence 
observed.67 In analysis of 57,589 women in the Multiethnic Cohort, significant adverse 
associations of NOx, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 with breast cancer incidence were observed 
among those living within 500 m of major roads, with stronger associations for NOx and 
NO2 among African American and Japanese American women overall.68 In the Canadian 
National Breast Screening Study (n=89,247) there were adverse associations of both PM2.5 
(HR per 10 μg/m3 = 1.26, 95% CI 0.99–1.61) and NO2 (HRs per 9.7 ppb ranging from 1.13–
1.17) and risk of incident premenopausal but not postmenopausal disease.69,70 However, 
results from other recent studies have reported no clear associations with incident breast 
cancer risk.33,71,72 Further, in one case-control study of 4,059 breast cancer cases and 4,059 
matched controls nested in the French E3N cohort, there were significant inverse 
associations of ambient Cd and risk of both incident estrogen receptor (ER) - and ER-/
progesterone receptor (PR)- disease.73 In the Nurses Health studies, there was an adverse 
association of PM and all-cause mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer, as 
well as greater breast cancer specific mortality among women with stage 1 disease.74 
Results of studies of mammographic density, a breast cancer risk factor, are also mixed.75–77
For other types of cancer, there are fewer studies and results are also inconsistent. Although 
there was an adverse association of NOx and brain tumour incidence in analysis of 54,304 
participants in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort (incidence rate ratio (IRR) per 100

brain tumor risk in men (n = 94), particularly among Latino men, but not in women.82 There 
was also a significant adverse association of O3 and meningioma risk among men (n = 130). 
There was a significant adverse association of within-city ambient UFP concentration and 
malignant brain tumour incidence in analysis of 1.9 million CanCHEC participants in 
Montreal and Toronto (HR per 10,000/cm3 = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.19, n = 1,400).83
Among other cancers of the digestive organs and urinary tract, in the ACS CPS-II cohort, 
there were significant adverse associations of PM2.5 with kidney cancer mortality (HR per 
4.4 μg/m3 = 1.14, 95% CI 1.03–1.27, n = 927) and of NO2 with colorectal cancer mortality 
(HR per 6.5 ppb = 1.06, 95% CI 1.02–1.10, n = 6,475).61 The NHIS study reported 
significant adverse associations of PM2.5 and stomach (HR per 10 μg/m3 = 1.87, 95% CI 
1.20–2.92, n = 525) and colorectal (HR per 10 μg/m3 = 1.29, 95% CI 1.05–1.59, n = 2,572) 
cancer mortality.30 There were also some suggestive adverse associations in analysis of both 
kidney (n=697) and liver (n= 279) cancer incidence in ESCAPE, though there were small 
numbers of cancer cases.84,85 Total PM2.5 and PM2.5 S were also associated with incident 
gastric cancer risk.86,87 A Hong Kong cohort of 66,820 participants reported significant 
adverse associations of PM2.5 with both upper digestive tract (HR per 10 μg/m3 = 1.42, 95% 
CI 1.06–1.89, n = 323) and accessory organ (HR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.06–1.71, n = 676) cancer 
mortality.88 A Taiwan cohort including 23,820 participants and 464 incident hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) cases, accounting for 85–90% of primary liver cancer cases, reported 
adverse associations with PM2.5 mediated by alanine transaminase levels, an indicator of 
chronic liver inflammation.89 In a study including 56,245 HCC cases in the United States 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, there was a significant 
adverse association with PM2.5 (IRR per 10 μg/m3 = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.47).90 PM2.5 was 
also related with reduced HCC survival.91
Results of studies of hematopoietic cancers, leukemias and lymphomas, are also limited and 
mixed, with few studies having power to consider specific hematopoietic cancer subtypes. In 
the ACS CPS-II, there were no clear associations of ambient air pollutant exposure and non-
Hodgkinʼs lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkinʼs lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma, or leukemia 
mortality.61 However, in a more recent analysis among 115,996 ACS CPS-II Nutrition 
cohort participants including 2,595 incident hematologic cancer cases, there were significant 
adverse associations of outdoor benzene exposure and incident myelodysplastic syndromes 
and T-cell lymphoma overall, and follicular lymphoma among men.92 The NHIS study 
reported significant adverse PM2.5 associations with HL (HR per 10 μg/m3 = 4.18, 95% CI

Epidemiological Studies of Outdoor Air Pollution and Childhood Cancer
The incidence of childhood cancers is increasing, based on a recent report of data from 68 
countries and over 100 population-based registries.97 An average of 215,000 children aged 
younger than 15 years, and 85,000 children aged 15–19 years were diagnosed with cancer 
each year from 1990–2017, which is likely an underestimate due to a lack of data in low 
income countries. In children, leukemia and lymphoma account for almost half of all 
cancers, followed by central nervous system (CNS) tumors and tumors originating in 
embryonic tissues, such as neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and nephroblastoma.
The literature on outdoor air pollution and childhood cancers is limited. Most studies have 
examined leukemias, CNS tumors, or all childhood cancers combined, and few had 
sufficient sample sizes to stratify by more specific cancer subtypes. Most studies considered 
outdoor ambient air pollution exposure at birth or during childhood, while fewer examined 
prenatal exposure. Most early studies relied on metrics of traffic density, and were unable to 
examine concentrations of specific air pollutants. For example, a nationwide cohort in 
Switzerland observed that the risk of leukemia in children who lived < 100 m from a 
highway was 1.43 (95% CI 0.79–2.61) times greater than that of children who lived ≥ 500 m 
away, particularly for children aged younger than 5 years.98
Despite these limitations, there is some suggestive evidence for an adverse association of 
traffic-related air pollution and acute childhood leukemia.15,99–103 IARC noted that a weak 
adverse association with childhood leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL), could not be ruled out, but noted that results were inconsistent with evidence of 
potential publication bias.15 In a meta-analysis of 12 studies of traffic-related benzene 
exposure there was a nearly 1.5-fold higher risk of ALL and a 2-fold higher risk of AML.100 
In an even more recent meta-analysis of 29 studies, benzene exposure was adversely and 
linearly associated with risk of childhood leukemia, particularly AML, and most consistently 
among children < 6 years.102 There was also no association observed of NO2 and leukemia 
risk, except at the highest exposure levels, as well as no association with traffic density or 
PM2.5, though there were some possible associations with ALL.
Few studies have examined the relationship between air pollution and childhood CNS 
tumors.104–107 One difficulty is the potential for etiologic heterogeneity among phenotypes 
(e.g., astrocytomas and medulloblastomas), as few studies have data to examine these rare 
CNS subtypes. Danysh et al.104 in a study of 1,949 children diagnosed with a CNS tumor in 
Texas, reported significant adverse associations of both medium and medium-high 1,3-
butadiene concentrations and medium diesel particulate matter (DPM) concentrations with 
astrocytomas (IRRs = 1.46; 95% CI 1.05–2.01; 1.69; 95% CI 1.22–2.33; and 1.42; 95% CI 
1.05–1.94 respectively), as well as of medium DPM concentrations and medulloblastoma

clear associations of traffic-related air pollution and childhood CNS tumors.105–107
Among studies of prenatal outdoor air pollution exposure, studies of child cancer in 
California have observed significant adverse associations of exposure to traffic pollution 
during gestation and risk of ALL, germ-cell tumors and retinoblastoma.106 In another 
California study, each 25 ppb increase in average maternal exposure to NO, NO2, and NOx 
during pregnancy increased the risk of ALL in offspring by 9, 23, and 8% respectively.105 
Bilateral retinoblastoma was also associated with second and third trimesters exposures. 
Prenatal exposure to acetaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, and toluene were adversely 
associated with central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) and PAHs 
with medulloblastoma.108 A Texas study reported an adverse association of embryonal 
tumors in children whose mothers lived < 500 m from a major road during pregnancy 
compared with 500 m or more (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.00–1.54), with the strongest findings 
observed for unilateral retinoblastoma (OR = 1.67; 95% CI 0.96–2.93).109 In a study of 
more than two million Canadian children followed-up from birth to 4 years, PM2.5 exposure 
during the first trimester was associated with a significant adverse association of 
astrocytoma (HR per 4.0 μg/m3 = 1.40; 95% CI 1.05–1.86, n = 94) and first trimester NO2 
with ALL (HR per 13.3 ppb =1.20; 95% CI 1.02–1.41, n = 302).110
Lastly, a Utah study reported significant adverse PM2.5 - cancer mortality associations 
among pediatric patients with lymphoma and CNS tumors as well as among adolescent and 
young adult patients with CNS tumors, carcinomas, melanomas, breast, and colorectal 
cancers.111 Further research of mortality in childhood cancer patients is needed.
Biological Mechanisms of Air Pollution-Derived Carcinogenesis
The biological mechanisms behind air pollution-related carcinogenesis remain to be 
elucidated. Still, extensive evidence from indirect models show how outdoor air pollution 
contributes to abnormal cell proliferation and cancer.112 Post-inhalation, air pollutants may 
generate effects along the respiratory tract, in locations such as the extra-thoracic, 
tracheobronchial, or alveolar airways. Retained particles and gas can have significant 
consequences on both the local and systemic level, generating low-grade and long-term 
inflammation and oxidative stress.113 Air pollution contains several mutagens and 
carcinogens, including PAHs (e.g., benzo(a)pyrene and polar compounds),114 dioxins,115 
sulfur-containing compounds (SO3, H2SO4),116 and 3-nitrobenzanthrone.117 PAHs are a 
class of compounds associated with human cancer risk due to their ability to generate DNA 
adducts.118 One meta-analysis has confirmed the nonlinear dose-response relationship 
between air pollution PAH and DNA adducts,119 and several studies have indicated that 
carcinogen-DNA adducts are closely associated with cancer risk.120–122 However, an 
individual’s repair capacity may determine if DNA adducts are eliminated by the repair 
machinery, potentially inducing DNA mutations.123
Gene mutations and gene silencing are particularly relevant during carcinogenic processes 
when they can affect tumor suppressor genes (TSGs).124 Several studies have shown that 
there are fractions of outdoor air that contain mutagenic particulate and volatile matter.125

Author ManuscriptAlso, mice exposed to industrial ambient air pollution showed higher heritable mutation at 
tandem-repeat DNA loci.126 TP53 is a TSG involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and 
damage repair, and its mutation/inactivation contributes to the pathogenesis of lung cancer.
127 Studies have shown that low‐dose PM2.5 may induce epigenetic silencing of TP53 in 
human alveolar epithelial cells.128 Remarkably, studies from Yu et al.129 showed that the 
number of mutations was three times higher in air pollution-related lung cancers than in lung 
cancers from low-exposed regions. These mutations were seen across hundreds of genes, 
including TP53.
Outdoor air pollution has also been linked to several epigenetic modifications,130 including 
changes to post-translational modifications of histones,131 5-hydroxymethylation,130 and 
most notably DNA methylation (DNAm). DNAm is a biochemical change that occurs in 
cytosines, particularly at the CpG context, and modifies gene expression as well as several 
other functions. As mentioned for TP53, hypermethylation contributes to gene silencing,132 
but DNA hypomethylation contributes to chromosome instability133 and activation of 
retrotransposon sequences and repetitive elements such as LINE-1134 and Alu.135 DNA 
hypomethylation also affects critical chromosome regions such as the subtelomeric and 
pericentromeric regions.136 Exposure to ambient air pollution, whether short-term or long-
term, is associated with abnormal DNA methylation.137–139 Other studies have also shown 
that human epithelial cells exposed to PM2.5 are more susceptible to hypomethylation and 
transcriptional activation of several genes and also microRNAs (miRNAs), modifying 
cancer-related signaling pathways.140 PM2.5 is also able to induce changes in long non-
coding RNAs (lncRNA) such as loc146880 via reactive oxygen species (ROS), promoting 
autophagy and malignancy of lung cells.141
Transcriptional changes in miRNAs have also been described in human bronchial cells 
exposed to ambient PM2.5, including downregulation of miR-182 and miR-185, potentially 
deregulating oncogenes (SLC30A1, SERPINB2, and AKR1C1) and facilitating neoplastic 
transformation.142 Other studies have found that dysregulation of actin cytoskeleton and 
down-regulation of miR-802 expression is present in the A549 cell line after particulate 
matter exposure.143 Human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to various concentrations of 
PM2.5 also show transcription changes in hundreds of genes, affecting some involved in 
inflammatory and immune response, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, as well as 
decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner.144 Several other studies have found that 
air pollution compounds induce the release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including IL‐6, 
TNF‐α and granulocyte‐macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM‐CSF), resulting in low-
grade, chronic inflammation in the airway and throughout the body.145–147 Another critical 
driver of carcinogenesis associated with air pollution is oxidative stress (OS).148 OS is 
characterized by the increase in free radicals (reactive oxygen species [ROS] and reactive 
nitrogen species [RNS]). The most-studied air pollutants concerning the intracellular 
formation of free radicals are ozone (O3),149 nitrogen oxides (NO and NO2), and metals.150 
Early studies demonstrated that mouse fibroblasts exposed to ROS could lead to 
carcinogenic transformation of cells.151 ROS are considered pro-neoplastic factors, they 
stimulate cell proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and inhibit apoptosis.

initiation, promotion, and progression (Figure 4).153 Although not completely understood, 
individual and time-dependent dose influences the mechanisms by which environmental air 
pollutants result in cancer cell transformation. The impact of air pollution particular 
carcinogens and their mixtures disrupt several molecular processes via direct or indirect 
(inflammation and OS) damage, inducing TSG inactivation and the activation of oncogenes,
154 cell cycle alterations dependent on TP53 activation,155 activation of energetic 
dysregulation,156 chromosome instability,157–158 the inhibition of apoptosis,159 and the 
induction of cell proliferation in somatic cells.160 Further research will clarify which 
mechanisms are most relevant and can be used as early biomarkers of air pollution-related 
cancer.
Public Health/Policy Recommendations
Few cancers have been as well characterized as lung cancer from the perspective of etiology, 
leading to the well-documented predominant role of environmental factors in causing this 
highly fatal malignancy. As mentioned above, outdoor air pollution and specifically PM was 
classified by IARC as a causal agent (Group 1 carcinogen) for lung cancer.15 Despite this, 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in its most recent review of the 
evidence on PM, the Integrated Science Assessment, found the weight-of-evidence to 
indicate that PM2.5 is only “likely to be causal”.161 Nonetheless, when the IARC conclusion 
was published,162 its policy implications figured prominently in media reports.
From a public health policy perspective, the addition of outdoor air pollution to the list of 
causes of lung cancer, and potentially also to a growing list of cancers at other sites, offers 
another imperative for air quality management. Given widespread recognition that lung 
cancer is highly fatal, the IARC conclusion may prove a more powerful motivator than other 
less well understood, adverse effects of air pollution.
Implementing measures to reduce cancer due to outdoor air pollution is challenging, as there 
are typically numerous combustion sources with emissions including both specific 
carcinogens and other agents that may increase cancer risk. Based on understanding of 
carcinogenesis and considering the agents known to be in air pollution, a linear non-
threshold relationship between exposure and risk can be reasonably assumed.26,163,164 From 
a regulatory perspective, this implies that any exposure conveys some risk and that lowering 
exposure to the maximum extent feasible should be the goal.
The definition of “acceptable risk” by Lowrance165 is a useful starting point for considering 
management of cancer risk caused by air pollution: “A thing is safe if its risks are judged to 
be acceptable.” For lung cancer, using PM as the indicator of exposure, risks have been 
quantified with sufficient certainty for carrying out a risk assessment, but any consensus 
societal judgment as to the acceptability of lung cancer risk from air pollution is lacking. 
Estimates of the burden of lung cancer attributable to air pollution have been made at the 
population level (above). The global proportion of lung cancer deaths attributable to ambient 
PM2.5 is second only to tobacco smoking.

Author ManuscriptInterventions to reduce air pollution exposure may be considered at various scales including 
the individual, community, industrial, and broader regional scales.166 In the United States, 
the Clean Air Act calls on the Administrator of the EPA to set National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) that protect public health “with an adequate margin of safety.” For PM, 
that goal cannot be absolutely achieved as adverse effects of air pollution have been 
demonstrated at levels well below current NAAQS and for some adverse effects, including 
lung cancer, non-threshold risk relationships are biologically plausible. Acknowledging that 
risk cannot be fully avoided through regulatory action, the EPA uses risk assessment 
methods and scenarios of exposure reduction under different changes to the NAAQS. The 
adverse health effects considered have been those for which the agency has found the 
relationship to be causal. Thus, in the current revision of the PM NAAQS, lung cancer will 
likely not be an element of the risk assessment considered. Nonetheless, the many 
organizations concerned with lung cancer, should use the mounting evidence and IARC 
finding to advocate for accurate air pollution monitoring and tighter air quality management 
and for specific consideration of sources that most prominently contribute to the dose of 
inhaled carcinogens, including controlling fine PM from combustion, especially from fossil 
fuel sources.
Multiple interventions occurring over long time scales have led to improvements in outdoor 
air quality in many higher-income and some middle-income countries and improvements in 
health.23,24,167–170 Further research to evaluate the effectiveness of specific interventions in 
low- and middle- income countries, where air quality continues to worsen, is needed.167 
Reductions in biomass burning, which can contribute to high levels of air pollution outdoors, 
as well as improvements in cooking stoves and indoor ventilation are important air quality 
improvement strategies worldwide.171,172 Impacts in terms of reduction of lung cancer 
incidence, as noted above, requires long-term and sustained intervention over multiple years 
and decades. Although potential impacts on cancer survival post-diagnosis have also been 
suggested, further research is required to evaluate impacts of reducing patient-level outdoor 
air pollution exposure on survival.54
Available research regarding interventions to reduce outdoor air pollution levels has resulted 
in subsequent calls for cities to pursue more compact and mixed-use urban designs with a 
transport modal shift from private vehicles to active transport.173 Specific interventions may 
relate to destination accessibility, employment distribution, residential density, availability 
and cost of parking, and enhancement of active travel networks.174 Interventions related 
with road-traffic emissions have also included planning and development management, car-
free policies, clean air zones, vehicle technologies and reducing emissions from public 
sector transport services, smooth driving and speed reduction, public transportation 
provision, and raising public awareness of the adverse human health impacts of outdoor air 
pollution.169,175 The key role of the medical and healthcare community in raising public and 
patient awareness, including of monitoring of local air quality indices and guidelines,172 
motivating action on air quality management, and involvement in the policy process has 
been described.171,173,175,176 The support of the medical and healthcare community in the 
further conduct of relevant etiological and innovative intervention studies is also needed.173 
There is also increasing interest in the use of green spaces and green infrastructure in air 
pollution mitigation, though further research in terms of specific infrastructure deployment

Author Manuscriptis needed to optimize health benefits, reduce unintended consequences, and develop 
evidence-based guidelines for implementation.177
Individual-level interventions have also been described including the use of personal 
respirators, though impacts on exposure and health are difficult to evaluate in the general 
population.171,178 Reductions in exposure to PM2.5 and other particle pollutants have been 
reported in some studies,179 though the overall evidence remains inadequate.178 The use of 
personal respirators in combination with avoidance behaviour, such as route selection for 
example, has been recommended.178 Reductions in indoor levels of PM2.5 have been 
observed with the use of some household filtration systems.180,181 In terms of commuting 
mode, in a review of studies of travel microenvironments in Europe, pedestrians experienced 
the lowest exposure to air pollution and car users the highest, though results may not be 
applicable to other areas.182 Personal mobile monitoring technologies, including mobile 
phones, may support avoidance behaviours in the future.183
Lastly, the suggestion of possible greater-than-additive joint effects of cigarette smoking and 
PM2.5 concentrations for lung cancer mortality may also imply that public health efforts in 
tobacco control and air quality management may result in greater than expected reductions 
in lung cancer rates due to the reduction of cases attributable to the interaction of both 
factors.53
Conclusion
In conclusion, there is clear and substantial evidence of a link between outdoor ambient air 
pollution, and particularly PM in outdoor air, with lung cancer incidence and mortality 
causing hundreds of thousands of lung cancer deaths annually worldwide. This burden 
represents an urgent worldwide public health challenge requiring multiple multi-level public 
health and policy interventions for cancer prevention. Epidemiological evidence on outdoor 
air pollution and other types of cancer is more limited. Further research on cancer incidence 
and survival at other cancer sites is needed, as well as on the effectiveness of specific 
interventions for cancer prevention, particularly in low- and middle- income countries.

Abstract
Context—Associations have been found between day-to-day particulate air pollution and
increased risk of various adverse health outcomes, including cardiopulmonary mortality. However,
studies of health effects of long-term particulate air pollution have been less conclusive.
Objective—To assess the relationship between long-term exposure to fine particulate air
pollution and all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Vital status and cause of death data were collected by the
American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention II study, an ongoing prospective
mortality study, which enrolled approximately 1.2 million adults in 1982. Participants completed a
questionnaire detailing individual risk factor data (age, sex, race, weight, height, smoking history,
education, marital status, diet, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposures). The risk factor
data for approximately 500000 adults were linked with air pollution data for metropolitan areas
throughout the United States and combined with vital status and cause of death data through
December 31, 1998.
Main Outcome Measure—All-cause, lung cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality.
Results—Fine particulate and sulfur oxide–related pollution were associated with all-cause, lung
cancer, and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each 10-μg/m3 elevation in fine particulate air pollution
was associated with approximately a 4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause,
cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, respectively. Measures of coarse particle fraction and
total suspended particles were not consistently associated with mortality.

NIH-PA Author ManuscriptConclusion—Long-term exposure to combustion-related fine particulate air pollution is an
important environmental risk factor for cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality.
Based on several severe air pollution events,1-3 a temporal correlation between extremely
high concentrations of particulate and sulfur oxide air pollution and acute increases in
mortality was well established by the 1970s. Subsequently, epidemiological studies
published between 1989 and 1996 reported health effects at unexpectedly low
concentrations of particulate air pollution.4 The convergence of data from these studies,
while controversial,5 prompted serious reconsideration of standards and health
guidelines6-10 and led to a long-term research program designed to analyze health-related
effects due to particulate pollution.11-13 In 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency
adopted new ambient air quality standards that would impose regulatory limits on fine
particles measuring less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5). These new standards were
challenged by industry groups, blocked by a federal appeals court, but ultimately upheld by
the US Supreme Court.14
Although most of the recent epidemiological research has focused on effects of short-term
exposures, several studies suggest that long-term exposure may be more important in terms
of overall public health.4 The new standards for long-term exposure to PM2.5 were
originally based primarily on 2 prospective cohort studies,15,16 which evaluated the effects
of long-term pollution exposure on mortality. Both of these studies have been subjected to
much scrutiny,5 including an extensive independent audit and reanalysis of the original
data.17 The larger of these 2 studies linked individual risk factor and vital status data with
national ambient air pollution data.16 Our analysis uses data from the larger study and (1)
doubles the follow-up time to more than 16 years and triples the number of deaths; (2)
substantially expands exposure data, including gaseous copollutant data and new PM2.5 data,
which have been collected since the promulgation of the new air quality standards; (3)
improves control of occupational exposures; (4) incorporates dietary variables that account
for total fat consumption, and consumption of vegetables, citrus, and high-fiber grains; and
(5) uses recent advances in statistical modeling, including the incorporation of random
effects and nonpara-metric spatial smoothing components in the Cox proportional hazards
model.
METHODS
Study Population
The analysis is based on data collected by the American Cancer Society (ACS) as part of the
Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), an ongoing prospective mortality study of
approximately 1.2 million adults.18,19 Individual participants were enrolled by ACS
volunteers in the fall of 1982. Participants resided in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and Puerto Rico, and were generally friends, neighbors, or acquaintances of ACS volunteers.
Enrollment was restricted to persons who were aged 30 years or older and who were
members of households with at least 1 individual aged 45 years or older. Participants
completed a confidential questionnaire, which included questions about age, sex, weight,
height, smoking history, alcohol use, occupational exposures, diet, education, marital status,
and other characteristics.

NIH-PA Author ManuscriptVital status of study participants was ascertained by ACS volunteers in September of the
following years: 1984, 1986, and 1988. Reported deaths were verified with death
certificates. Subsequently, through December 31, 1998, vital status was ascertained through
automated linkage of the CPS-II study population with the National Death Index.19
Ascertainment of deaths was more than 98% complete for the period of 1982-1988 and 93%
complete after 1988.19 Death certificates or codes for cause of death were obtained for more
than 98% of all known deaths. Cause of death was coded according to the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Although the CPS-II cohort included
approximately 1.2 million participants with adequate questionnaire and cause-of-death data,
our analysis was restricted to those participants who resided in US metropolitan areas with
available pollution data. The actual size of the analytic cohort varied depending on the
number of metropolitan areas for which pollution data were available. TABLE 1 provides
the number of metropolitan areas and participants available for each source of pollution
data.
Air Pollution Exposure Estimates
Each participant was assigned a metropolitan area of residence based on address at time of
enrollment and 3-digit ZIP code area.20 Mean (SD) concentrations of air pollution for the
metropolitan areas were compiled from various primary data sources (Table 1). Many of the
particulate pollution indices, including PM2.5, were available from data from the Inhalable
Particle Monitoring Network for 1979-1983 and data from the National Aerometric
Database for 1980-1981, periods just prior to or at the beginning of the follow-up period. An
additional data source was the Environmental Protection Agency Aerometric Information
Retrieval System (AIRS). The mean concentration of each pollutant from all available
monitoring sites was calculated for each metropolitan area during the 1 to 2 years prior to
enrollment.17
Additional information on ambient pollution during the follow-up period was extracted from
the AIRS database as quarterly mean values for each routinely monitored pollutant for 1982
through 1998. All quarterly averages met summary criteria imposed by the Environmental
Protection Agency and were based on observations made on at least 50% of the scheduled
sampling days at each site. The quarterly mean values for all stations in each metro politan
area were calculated across the study years using daily average values for each pollutant
except ozone. For ozone, daily 1-hour maximums were used and were calculated for the full
year and for the third quarter only (ie, July, August, September). While gaseous pollutants
generally had recorded data throughout the entire follow-up period of interest, the particulate
matter monitoring protocol changed in the late 1980s from total suspended particles to
particles measuring less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10), resulting in the majority of total
suspended particle data being available in the early to mid-1980s and PM10 data being
mostly available in the early to mid-1990s.
As a consequence of the new PM2.5 standard, a large number of sites began collecting PM2.5
data in 1999. Daily PM2.5 data were extracted from the AIRS database for 1999 and the first
3 quarters of 2000. For each site, quarterly averages for each of the 2 years were computed.
The 4 quarters were averaged when at least 1 of the 2 corresponding quarters for each year

NIH-PA Author Manuscripthad at least 50% of the sixth-day samples and at least 45 total sampling days available.
Measurements were averaged first by site and then by metropolitan area. Although no
network of PM2.5 monitoring existed in the United States between the early 1980s and the
late 1990s, the integrated average of PM2.5 concentrations during the period was estimated
by averaging the PM2.5 concentration for early and later periods.
Mean sulfate concentrations for 1980-1981 were available for many cities based on data
from the Inhalable Particle Monitoring Network and the National Aerometric Database.
Recognizing that sulfate was artifactually overestimated due to glass fiber filters used at that
time, season and region-specific adjustments were made.17 Since few states analyzed
particulate samples for sulfates after the early 1980s, individual states were directly
contacted for data regarding filter use. Ion chromatography was used to analyze PM10 filters
and this data could be obtained from metropolitan areas across the United States. Filters
were collected for a single reference year (1990) in the middle of the 1982-1998 study
period. The use of quartz filters virtually eliminated the historical overestimation of sulfate.
Mean sulfate concentrations for 1990 were estimated using sulfate from AIRS, data reported
directly from individual states, and analysis of archived filters.
Statistical Analysis
The basic statistical approach used in this analysis is an extension of the standard Cox
proportional hazards survival model,21 which has been used for risk estimates of pollution-
related mortality in previous longitudinal cohort studies.15,16 The standard Cox model
implicitly assumes that observations are statistically independent after controlling for
available risk factors, resulting in 2 concerns with regard to risk estimates of pollution-
related mortality.22 First, if the assumption of statistical independence is not valid, the
uncertainty in the risk estimates of pollution-related mortality may be misstated. Second,
even after controlling for available risk factors, survival times of par ticipants living in
communities closer together may be more similar than participants living in communities
farther apart, which results in spatial autocorrelation. If this spatial autocorrelation is due to
missing or systematically mismeasured risk factors that are spatially correlated with air
pollution, then the risk estimates of pollution-related mortality may be biased due to
inadequate control of these factors. Therefore, in this analysis, the Cox proportional hazards
model was extended by incorporating a spatial random-effects component, which provided
accurate estimates of the uncertainty of effect estimates. The model also evaluated spatial
autocorrelation and incorporated a nonparametric spatial smooth component (to account for
unexplained spatial structure). A more detailed description of this modeling approach is
provided elsewhere.22
The baseline analysis in this study estimated adjusted relative risk (RR) ratios for mortality
by using a Cox proportional hazards model with inclusion of a metropolitan-based random-
effects component. Model fitting involved a 2-stage process. In the first stage, survival data
were modeled using the standard Cox proportional hazards model, including individual level
covariates and indicator variables for each metropolitan area (without pollution variables).
Output from stage 1 provided estimates of the metropolitan-specific logarithm of the RRs of
mortality (relative to an arbitrary reference community), which were adjusted for individual

reference community, was then removed.23 In the second stage, the estimates of adjusted
metropolitan-specific health responses were related to fine particulate air pollution using a
linear random-effects regression model.24 The time variable used in the models was survival
time from the date of enrollment. Survival times of participants who did not die were
censored at the end of the study period. To control for age, sex, and race, all of the models
were stratified by 1-year age categories, sex, and race (white vs other), which allowed each
category to have its own baseline hazard. Models were estimated for all-cause mortality and
for 3 separate mortality categories: cardiopulmonary (ICD-9 401-440 and 460-519), lung
cancer (ICD-9 162), and all others.
Models were estimated separately for each of the 3 fine particle variables, PM2.5
(1979-1983), PM2.5 (1999-2000), and PM2.5 (average). Individual level covariates were
included in the models to adjust for various important individual risk factors. All of these
variables were classified as either indicator (ie, yes/no, binary, dummy) variables or
continuous variables. Variables used to control for tobacco smoke, for example, included
both indicator and continuous variables. The smoking indicator variables included: current
cigarette smoker, former cigarette smoker, and a pipe or cigar smoker only (all vs never
smoking) along with indicator variables for starting smoking before or after age 18 years.
The continuous smoking variables included: current smoker's years of smoking, current
smoker's years of smoking squared, current smoker's cigarettes per day, current smoker's
cigarettes per day squared, former smoker's years of smoking, former smoker's years of
smoking squared, former smoker's cigarettes per day, former smoker's cigarettes per day
squared, and the number of hours per day exposed to passive cigarette smoke.
To control for education, 2 indicator variables, which indicated completion of high school or
education beyond high school, were included. Marital status variables included indicator
variables for single and other vs married. Both body mass index (BMI) values and BMI
values squared were included as continuous variables. Indicator variables for beer, liquor,
and wine drinkers and nonresponders vs non-drinkers were included to adjust for alcohol
consumption. Occupational exposure was controlled for using various indicator variables:
regular occupational exposure to asbestos, chemicals/ acids/solvents, coal or stone dusts,
coal tar/pitch/asphalt, diesel engine exhaust, or formaldehyde, and additional indicator
variables that indicated 9 different rankings of an occupational dirtiness index that has been
developed and described elsewhere.17,25 Two diet indices that accounted for fat
consumption and consumption of vegetables, citrus, and high-fiber grains were derived
based on information given in the enrollment questionnaire.18 Quintile indicator variables
for each of these diet indices were also included in the models.18
In addition to the baseline analysis, several additional sets of analysis were conducted. First,
to more fully evaluate the shape of the concentration-response function, a robust locally
weighted regression smoother26 (within the generalized additive model framework27) was
used to estimate the relationship between particulate air pollution and mortality in the
second stage of model fitting. Second, the sensitivity of the fine particle mortality risk
estimates compared with alternative modeling approaches and assumptions was evaluated.
Standard Cox proportional hazards models were fit to the data including particulate air

stepwise process) groups of variables to control for smoking, education, marital status, BMI,
alcohol consumption, occupational exposures, and diet.
In addition, to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated pollution effect while more
aggressively controlling for spatial differences in mortality, a 2-dimensional term to account
for spatial trends was added to the models and was estimated using a locally weighted
regression smoother. The “span” parameter, which controls the complexity of the surface
smooth, was set at 3 different settings to allow for increasingly aggressive fitting of the
spatial structure. These included a default span of 50%, the span that resulted in the lowest
unexplained variance in mortality rate between metropolitan areas, and the span that resulted
in the strongest evidence (highest P value) to suggest no residual spatial structure. The risk
estimates and SEs (and thus the confidence intervals) were estimated using generalized
additive modeling27 with S-Plus statistical software,28 which provides unbiased effect
estimates, but may underestimate SEs if there is significant spatial autocorrelation and
significant correlations between air pollution and the smoothed surface of mortality.
Therefore, evidence of spatial autocorrelation was carefully evaluated and tested using the
Bartlett test.29 The correlations of residual mortality with distance between metropolitan
areas were graphically examined.
Analyses were also conducted of effect modification by age, sex, smoking status,
occupational exposure, and education. Finally, models were fit using a variety of alternative
pollution indices, including gaseous pollutants. Specifically, models were estimated
separately for each of the pollution variables listed in Table 1, while also including all of the
other risk factor variables.
RESULTS
Fine particulate air pollution generally declined in the United States during the follow-up
period of this study. FIGURE 1 plots mean PM2.5 concentrations for 1999-2000 over mean
PM2.5 concentrations for 1979-1983 for the 51 cities in which paired data were available.
The concentrations of PM2.5 were lower in 1999-2000 than in 1979-1983 for most cities,
with the largest reduction observed in the cities with the highest concentrations of pollution
during 1979-1983. Mean PM2.5 levels in the 2 periods were highly correlated (r=0.78). The
rank ordering of cities by relative pollution levels remained nearly the same. Therefore, the
relative levels of fine particle concentrations were similar whether based on measurements
at the beginning of the study period, shortly following the study period, or an average of the
2.
As reported in TABLE 2, all 3 indices of fine particulate air pollution were associated with
all-cause, cardiopulmo-nary, and lung cancer mortality, but not mortality from all other
causes combined. FIGURE 2 presents the nonpara-metric smoothed exposure response
relationships between cause-specific mortality and PM2.5 (average). The log RRs for all-
cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality increased across the gradient of fine
particulate matter. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that the associations were not significantly
different from linear associations (P>.20).

NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe fine particle mortality RR ratios from various alternative modeling approaches and
assumptions are presented in FIGURE 3. After controlling for smoking, education, and
marital status, the controlled forward stepwise inclusion of additional covariates had little
influence on the estimated associations with fine particulate air pollution on
cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality. As expected, cigarette smoking was highly
significantly associated with el evated risk of all-cause, cardiopulmo-nary, and lung cancer
mortality (P<.001). Estimated RRs for an average current smoker (men and women
combined, 22 cigarettes/day for 33.5 years, with initiation before age 18 years) were equal to
2.58, 2.89, and 14.80 for all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality,
respectively. Statistically significant, but substantially smaller and less robust associations,
were also observed for education, marital status, BMI, alcohol consumption, occupational
exposure, and diet variables. Although many of these covariates were also statistically
associated with mortality, the risk estimates of pollution-related mortality were not highly
sensitive to the inclusion of these additional covariates.
Figure 3 also demonstrates that the introduction of the random-effects component to the
model resulted in larger SEs of the estimates and, therefore, somewhat wider 95%
confidence intervals. There was no evidence of statistically significant spatial
autocorrelation in the survival data based on the Bartlett test (P[H11022].20) after
controlling for fine particulate air pollution and the various individual risk factors.
Furthermore, graphical examination of the correlations of the residual mortality with
distance between metropolitan areas did not reveal significant spatial autocorrelation (results
not shown). Nevertheless, the incorporation of spatial smoothing was included to further
investigate the robustness of the estimated particulate pollution effect. Effect estimates were
not highly sensitive to the incorporation of spatial smoothing to account for regional
clustering or other spatial patterns in the data.
FIGURE 4 presents fine particle air pollution–related mortality RR ratios after stratifying
by age, sex, education, and smoking status, and adjusting for all other risk factors. The
differences across age and sex strata were not generally consistent or statistically significant.
However, a consistent pattern emerged from this stratified analysis: the association with
particulate pollution was stronger for both cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality for
participants with less education. Also, for both cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality,
the RR estimates were higher for nonsmokers.
FIGURE 5 summarizes the associations between mortality risk and air pollutant
concentrations listed in Table 1. Statistically significant and relatively consistent mortality
associations existed for all measures of fine particulate exposure, including PM2.5 and
sulfate particles. Weaker less consistent mortality associations were observed with PM10 and
PM15. Measures of the coarse particle fraction (PM15-2.5) and total suspended particles were
not consistently associated with mortality. Of the gaseous pollutants, only sulfur dioxide was
associated with elevated mortality risk. Interestingly, measures of PM2.5 were associated
with all-cause cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality, but not with all other mortality.
However, sulfur oxide pollution (as measured by sulfate particles and/or sulfur dioxide) was
significantly associated with mortality from all other causes in addition to all-cause,
cardiopulmo-nary, and lung cancer mortality.

Thisstudydemonstratedassociationsbetween ambient fine particulate air pollution and
elevated risks of both cardio-pulmonary and lung cancer mortality. Each 10-μg/m3 elevation
in long-term average PM2.5 ambient concentrations was associated with approximately a
4%, 6%, and 8% increased risk of all-cause, cardiopulmonary, and lung cancer mortality,
respectively, although the magnitude of the effect somewhat depended on the time frame of
pollution monitoring. In addition, this analysis addresses many of the important questions
concerning the earlier, more limited analysis of the large CPS-II cohort, including the
following issues.
First, does the apparent association between pollution and mortality persist with longer
follow-up and as the cohort ages and dies? The present analysis more than doubled the
follow-up time to more than 16 years, resulting in approximately triple the number of
deaths, yet the associations between pollution and mortality persisted.
Second, can the association between fine particulate air pollution and increased
cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality be due to inadequate control of important
individual risk factors? After aggressively controlling for smoking, the estimated fine
particulate pollution effect on mortality was remarkably robust. When the analysis was
stratified by smoking status, the estimated pollution effect on both cardio-pulmonary and
lung cancer mortality was strongest for never smokers vs former or current smokers. This
analysis also controlled for education, marital status, BMI, and alcohol consumption. This
analysis used improved variables to control for occupational exposures and incorporated diet
variables that accounted for total fat consumption, as well as for consumption of vegetables,
citrus, and high-fiber grains. The mortality associations with fine particulate air pollution
were largely unaffected by the inclusion of these indi vidualriskfactorsinthemodels.Thedata
on smoking and other individual risk factors, however, were obtained directly by
questionnaire at time of enrollment and do not reflect changes that may have occurred
following enrollment. The lack of risk factor follow-up data results in some
misclassificationofexposure,reducesthe precision of control for risk factors, and constrains
our ability to differentiate time dependency.
Third, are the associations between fine particulate air pollution and mortality due to
regional or other spatial differences that are not adequately controlled for in the analysis? If
there are unmeasured or inadequately modeled risk factors that are different across locations,
then spatial clustering will occur. If this clustering is independent or random across
metropolitan areas, then the spatial clustering can be modeled by adding a random-effects
component to the Cox proportional hazards model as was done in our analysis. The
clustering may not be independent or random across metropolitan areas due to inadequately
measured or modeled risk factors (either individual or ecological). If these inadequately
measured or modeled risk factors are also spatially correlated with air pollution, then biased
pollution effects estimates may occur due to confounding. However, in this analysis,
significant spatial autocorrelation was not observed after controlling for fine particulate air
pollution and the various individual risk factors. Furthermore, to minimize any potential
confounding bias, sensitivity analyses, which directly modeled spatial trends using
Pope et al.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscriptnonparametric smoothing techniques, were conducted. A contribution of this analysis is that
it included the incorporation of both random effects and nonparametric spatial smoothing
components to the Cox proportional hazards model. Even after accounting for random
effects across metropolitan areas and aggressively modeling a spatial structure that accounts
for regional differences, the association between fine particulate air pollution and
cardiopulmonary and lung cancer mortality persists.
Fourth, is mortality associated primarily with fine particulate air pollution or is mortality
also associated with other measures of particulate air pollution, such as PM10, total
suspended particles, or with various gaseous pollutants? Elevated mortality risks were
associated primarily with measures of fine particulate and sulfur oxide pollution. Coarse
particles and gaseous pollutants, except for sulfur dioxide, were generally not significantly
associated with elevated mortality risk.
Fifth, what is the shape of the concentration-responsefunction?Withinthe range of pollution
observed in this analysis, the concentration-response function appears to be monotonic and
nearly linear. However, this does not preclude a leveling off (or even steepening) at much
higher levels of air pollution.
Sixth, how large is the estimated mortality effect of exposure to fine particulate air pollution
relative to other risk factors? A detailed description and
interpretationofthemanyindividualrisk factors that are controlled for in the analysis goes well
beyond the scope of this report. However, the mortality risk associated with cigarette
smoking has been well documented using the CPS-II cohort.16 The risk imposed by
exposure to fine particulate air pollution is obviously much smaller than the risk of cigarette
smoking. Another risk factor that has been well documented using the CPS-II cohort data is
body mass as measured by BMI.30 The Word Health Organization has categorized BMI
values between 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 as normal; 25- 29.9 kg/m2, grade 1 overweight; 30- 39.9
kg/m2, grade 2 overweight; and 40 kg/m2 or higher, grade 3 overweight.31 In the present
analysis, BMI values and BMI values squared were included in the proportional hazards
models. Consistent with previous ACS analysis,30 BMI was significantly associated with
mortality, optimal BMI was between approximately 23.5 and 24.9 kg/m2, and the RR of
mortality for different BMI values relative to the optimal were dependent on sex and
smoking status. For example, the RRs associated with BMI values between 30.0 and 31.9
kg/m2 (vs optimal) would be up to approxi mately 1.33 for never smokers. Based on these
calculations, mortality risks associated with fine particulate air pollution at levels found in
more polluted US metropolitan areas are less than those associated with substantial obesity
(grade 3 overweight), but comparable with the estimated effect of being moderately
overweight (grade 1 to 2).
In conclusion, the findings of this study provide the strongest evidence to date that long-term
exposure to fine particulate air pollution common to many metropolitan areas is an
important risk factor for cardiopulmonary mortality. In addition, the large cohort and
extended follow-up have provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate associations
between air pollution and lung cancer mortality. Elevated fine particulate air pollution
exposures were associated with significant increases in lung cancer mortality. Although

associations between fine particulate air pollution and lung cancer mortality, as well as
cardiopulmonary mortality, are observed even after controlling for cigarette smoking, BMI,
diet, occupational exposure, other individual risk factors, and after controlling for regional
and other spatial differences.

Abstract
BACKGROUND—Although many studies have linked elevations in tropospheric ozone to
adverse health outcomes, the effect of long-term exposure to ozone on air pollution–related
mortality remains uncertain. We examined the potential contribution of exposure to ozone to the
risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes and specifically to death from respiratory causes.
METHODS—Data from the study cohort of the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention
Study II were correlated with air-pollution data from 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United
States. Data were analyzed from 448,850 subjects, with 118,777 deaths in an 18-year follow-up
period. Data on daily maximum ozone concentrations were obtained from April 1 to September 30
for the years 1977 through 2000. Data on concentrations of fine particulate matter (particles that
are ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) were obtained for the years 1999 and 2000.
Associations between ozone concentrations and the risk of death were evaluated with the use of
standard and multilevel Cox regression models.
RESULTS—In single-pollutant models, increased concentrations of either PM2.5 or ozone were
significantly associated with an increased risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In two-
pollutant models, PM2.5 was associated with the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, whereas
ozone was associated with the risk of death from respiratory causes. The estimated relative risk of
death from respiratory causes that was associated with an increment in ozone concentration of 10
ppb was 1.040 (95% confidence interval, 1.010 to 1.067). The association of ozone with the risk of
death from respiratory causes was insensitive to adjustment for confounders and to the type of
statistical model used.
CONCLUSIONS—In this large study, we were not able to detect an effect of ozone on the risk of
death from cardiovascular causes when the concentration of PM2.5 was taken into account. We
did, however, demonstrate a significant increase in the risk of death from respiratory causes in
association with an increase in ozone concentration.

NIH-PA Author ManuscriptStudies conducted over the past 15 years have provided substantial evidence that long-term
exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for cardiopulmonary disease and death.1–5 Recent
reviews of this literature suggest that fine particulate matter (particles that are ≤2.5 μm in
aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5]) has a primary role in these adverse health effects.6,7 The
particulate-matter component of air pollution includes complex mixtures of metals, black
carbon, sulfates, nitrates, and other direct and indirect byproducts of incomplete combustion
and high-temperature industrial processes.
Ozone is a single, well-defined pollutant, yet the effect of exposure to ozone on air
pollution–related mortality remains inconclusive. Several studies have evaluated this issue,
but they have been short-term studies,8–10 have failed to show a statistically significant
effect,1,3 or have been based on limited mortality data.11 Recent reviews by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)12 and the National Research Council13 have
questioned the overall consistency of the available data correlating exposure to ozone and
mortality. Similar conclusions about the evidence base for the long-term effects of ozone on
mortality were drawn by a panel of experts in the United Kingdom.14
Nonetheless, previous studies have suggested that a measurable effect of ozone may exist,
particularly with respect to the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes. In one of the
larger studies, ozone was significantly associated with death from cardiopulmonary causes15
but not with death from ischemic heart disease. However, the estimated effect of ozone on
the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes in this study was attenuated when PM2.5 was
added to the analysis in copollutant models. On the basis of suggested effects of ozone on
the risk of death from cardiopulmonary causes (which includes death from respiratory
causes) but an absence of evidence for effects of ozone on the risk of death from ischemic
heart disease, we hypothesized that ozone might have a primary effect on the risk of death
from respiratory causes.
METHODS
HEALTH, MORTALITY, AND CONFOUNDING DATA
Our study used data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II)
cohort.16 The CPS II cohort consists of more than 1.2 million participants who were enrolled
by American Cancer Society volunteers between September 1982 and February 1983 in all
50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Enrollment was restricted to persons
who were at least 30 years of age living in households with at least one person 45 years of
age or older. After providing written informed consent, the participants completed a
confidential questionnaire that included questions on demographic characteristics, smoking
history, alcohol use, diet, and education.17 Deaths were ascertained until August 1988 by
personal inquiries of family members by the volunteers and thereafter by linkage with the
National Death Index. Through 1995, death certificates were obtained and coded for cause
of death. Beginning in 1996, codes for cause of death were provided by the National Death
Index.18
The study population for our analysis included only those participants in CPS II who resided
in U.S. metropolitan statistical areas within the 48 contiguous states or the District of

available from at least one pollution monitor within their metropolitan area. The study was
approved by the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethics Board, Canada.
Data on “ecologic” risk factors at the level of the metropolitan area representing social
variables (educational level, percentage of homes with air conditioning, percentage of the
population who were nonwhite), economic variables (household income, unemployment,
income disparity), access to medical care (number of physicians and hospital beds per
capita), and meteorologic variables were obtained from the 1980 U.S. Census and other
secondary sources (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this
article at NEJM.org). These ecologic risk factors, as well as the individual risk factors
collected in the CPS II questionnaire, were assessed as potential confounders of the effects
of ozone.3,5,19,20
ESTIMATES OF EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION
Ozone data were obtained from 1977 (5 years before the identification of the CPS II cohort)
through 2000 for all air-pollution monitors in the study metropolitan areas from the EPA’s
Aerometric Information Retrieval System. Ozone data at each monitoring site were collected
on an hourly basis, and the daily maximum value for the site was determined. All available
daily maximum values for the monitoring site were averaged over each quarter year. The
quarterly average values were reported for each monitor only when at least 75% of daily
observations for that quarter were available.
The averages of the second (April through June) and third (July through September) quarters
were calculated for each monitor if both quarterly averages were available. The period from
April through September was selected because ozone concentrations tend to be elevated
during the warmer seasons and because fewer data were available for the cooler seasons.
The average of the second and third quarterly averages for each year was then computed for
all the monitors within each metropolitan area to form a single annual time series of air-
pollution measurements for each metropolitan area for the period from 1977 to 2000. In
addition, a summary measure of long-term exposure to ambient warm-season ozone was
defined as the average of annual time-series measurements during the entire period from
1977 to 2000. Individual measures of exposure to ozone were then defined by assigning the
average for the metropolitan area to each cohort member residing in that area.
Data on exposure to PM2.5 were also obtained from the Aerometric Information Retrieval
System database for the 2-year period from 1999 to 2000 (data on PM2.5 were not available
before 1999 for most metropolitan areas).5 The average concentrations of PM2.5 were
included in our analyses to distinguish the effect of particulates from that of ozone on
outcomes.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Standard and multilevel random-effects Cox proportional-hazard models were used to assess
the risk of death in relation to exposures to pollution. The subjects were matched according
to age (in years), sex, and race. A total of 20 variables with 44 terms were used to control for

NIH-PA Author Manuscriptindividual characteristics that might confound or modify the association between air
pollution and death. These variables, which were considered to be of potential importance
on the basis of previous studies, included individual risk factors for which data had been
collected in the CPS II questionnaire. Seven ecologic covariates obtained from the 1980
U.S. Census (median household income, the proportion of persons living in households with
an income below 125% of the poverty line, the percentage of persons over the age of 16
years who were unemployed, the percentage of adults with less than a high-school [12th-
grade] education, the percentage of homes with air conditioning, the Gini coefficient of
income inequality [ranging from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating an equal distribution of income
and 1 indicating that one person has all the income and everyone else has no income20], and
the percentage of persons who were white) were also included. These variables were
included at two levels: as the average for the metropolitan statistical area and as the
difference between the average for the ZIP Code of residence and the average for the
metropolitan statistical area. Additional sensitivity analyses were undertaken for ecologic
variables that were available for only a subgroup of the 96 metropolitan statistical areas (see
the Supplementary Appendix). Models were estimated for either ozone or PM2.5. In
addition, models with both PM2.5 and ozone were estimated.
In additional analyses, our basic Cox models were modified by incorporating an adjustment
for community-level random effects, which allowed us to take into account residual
variation in mortality among communities.21 The baseline hazard function was modulated
by a community-specific random variable representing the residual risk of death for subjects
in that community after individual and ecologic risk factors had been controlled for (see the
Supplementary Appendix).
A formal analysis was conducted to assess whether a threshold existed for the association
between exposure to ozone and the risk of death (see the Supplementary Appendix). A
standard threshold model was postulated in which there was no association between
exposure to ozone and the risk of death below a specified threshold concentration and a
linear association (on the logarithmic scale of the proportional-hazards model) above the
threshold.
The question of whether specific time windows were associated with the health effects was
investigated by subdividing the follow-up interval into four periods (1982 to 1988, 1989 to
1992, 1993 to 1996, and 1997 to 2000). Exposures were matched for each of these periods
and also tested for a 10-year average on the basis of the 5-year follow-up period and the 5
years before the follow-up period (see the Supplementary Appendix).
RESULTS
The analytic cohort included 448,850 subjects residing in 96 metropolitan statistical areas
(Fig. 1). In 1980, the populations of these 96 areas ranged from 94,436 to 8,295,900. Data
were available on the concentration of ambient ozone from all 96 areas and on the
concentration of PM2.5 from 86 areas. The average number of air-pollution monitors per
metropolitan area was 11 (range, 1 to 57), and more than 80% of the areas had 6 or more
monitors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author ManuscriptThe average ozone concentration for each metropolitan area during the interval from 1977 to
2000 ranged from 33.3 ppb to 104.0 ppb (Fig. 1). The highest regional concentrations were
in Southern California and the lowest in the Pacific Northwest and parts of the Great Plains.
Moderately elevated concentrations were present in many areas of the East, Midwest, South,
and Southwest.
The baseline characteristics of the study population, overall and as a function of exposure to
ozone, are presented in Table 1. The mean age of the cohort was 56.6 years, 43.4% were
men, 93.7% were white, 22.4% were current smokers, and 30.5% were former smokers. On
the basis of estimates from 1980 Census data, 62.3% of homes had air conditioning at the
time of initial data collection.
During the 18-year follow-up period (from initial CPS II data collection in 1982 through the
end of follow-up in 2000), there were 118,777 deaths in the study cohort (Table 2). Of these,
58,775 were from cardiopulmonary causes, including 48,884 from cardiovascular causes (of
which 27,642 were due to ischemic heart disease) and 9891 from respiratory causes.
In the single-pollutant models, exposure to ozone was not associated with the overall risk of
death (relative risk, 1.001; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.996 to 1.007) (Table 3).
However, it was significantly correlated with an increase in the risk of death from
cardiopulmonary causes. A 10-ppb increment in exposure to ozone elevated the relative risk
of death from the following causes: cardiopulmonary causes (relative risk, 1.014; 95% CI,
1.007 to 1.022), cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 1.011; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.023),
ischemic heart disease (relative risk, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.026), and respiratory causes
(relative risk, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.010 to 1.048).
Inclusion of the concentration of PM2.5 measured in 1999 and 2000 as a copollutant (Table
3) attenuated the association with exposure to ozone for all the end points except death from
respiratory causes, for which a significant correlation persisted (relative risk, 1.040; 95% CI,
1.013 to 1.067). The concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 were positively correlated (r = 0.64
at the subject level and r = 0.56 at the metropolitan-area level), resulting in unstable risk
estimates for both pollutants. The concentration of PM2.5 remained significantly associated
with death from cardiopulmonary causes, cardiovascular causes, and ischemic heart disease
when ozone was included in the model. The association of ozone concentrations with death
from respiratory causes remained significant after adjustment for PM2.5.
Risk estimates for ozone-related death from respiratory causes were insensitive to the use of
a random-effects survival model allowing for spatial clustering within the metropolitan area
and state of residence (Table 1S in the Supplementary Appendix). The association between
increased ozone concentrations and increased risk of death from respiratory causes was also
insensitive to adjustment for several ecologic variables considered individually (Table 2S in
the Supplementary Appendix).
Subgroup analyses showed that environmental temperature and region of the country, but
not sex, age at enrollment, body-mass index, education, or concentration of PM2.5,
significantly modified the effects of ozone on the risk of death from respiratory causes
(Table 4).

NIH-PA Author ManuscriptFigure 2 illustrates the shape of the relation between exposure to ozone and death from
respiratory causes. There was limited evidence that a threshold model specification
improved model fit as compared with a nonthreshold linear model (P = 0.06) (Table 3S in
the Supplementary Appendix).
Because air-pollution data from 1977 to 2000 were averaged, exposure values for persons
who died during this period are based partly on data that were obtained after death had
occurred. Further investigation by dividing this interval into specific time windows of
exposure revealed no significant difference between the effects of earlier and later time
windows within the period of follow-up. Allowing for a 10-year period of exposure to ozone
(5 years of follow-up and 5 years before the follow-up period) did not appreciably alter the
risk estimates (Table 4S in the Supplementary Appendix). Thus, when exposure values were
matched more closely to the follow-up period and when exposure values were based on data
obtained before the deaths, there was little change in the results.
DISCUSSION
Our principal finding is that ozone and PM2.5 contributed independently to increased annual
mortality rates in this large, U.S. cohort study in analyses that controlled for many individual
and ecologic risk factors. In two-pollutant models that included ozone and PM2.5, ozone was
significantly associated only with death from respiratory causes.
For every 10-ppb increase in exposure to ozone, we observed an increase in the risk of death
from respiratory causes of about 2.9% in single-pollutant models and 4% in two-pollutant
models. Although this increase may appear moderate, the risk of dying from a respiratory
cause is more than three times as great in the metropolitan areas with the highest ozone
concentrations as in those with the lowest ozone concentrations. The effects of ozone on the
risk of death from respiratory causes were insensitive to adjustment for individual,
neighborhood, and metropolitan-area confounders or to differences in multilevel-model
specifications.
There is biologic plausibility for a respiratory effect of ozone. In laboratory studies, ozone
can increase airway inflammation24 and can worsen pulmonary function and gas
exchange.25 In addition, exposure to elevated concentrations of tropospheric ozone has been
associated with numerous adverse health effects, including the induction26 and
exacerbation27,28 of asthma, pulmonary dysfunction,29,30 and hospitalization for respiratory
causes.31
Despite these observations, previous studies linking long-term exposure to ozone with death
have been inconclusive. One cohort study conducted in the Midwest and eastern United
States reported an inverse but nonsignificant association between ozone concentrations and
mortality.1 Subsequent reanalyses of this study replicated these findings but also suggested a
positive association with exposure to ozone during warm seasons.3 A study of
approximately 6000 non-smoking Seventh-Day Adventists living in Southern California
showed elevated risks among men after long-term exposure to ozone,11 but this finding was
based on limited mortality data.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author ManuscriptPrevious studies using the CPS II cohort have also produced mixed results for ozone. An
earlier examination based on a large sample of more than 500,000 people from 117
metropolitan areas and 8 years of follow-up indicated nonsignificant results for the relation
between ozone and death from any cause and a significant inverse association between
ozone and death from lung cancer. A positive association between death from
cardiopulmonary causes and summertime exposure to ozone was observed in single-
pollutant models, but the association with ozone was nonsignificant in two-pollutant
models.3 Further analyses based on 16 years of follow-up in 134 cities produced similarly
elevated but nonsignificant associations that were suggestive of effects of summertime (July
to September) exposure to ozone on death from cardiopulmonary causes.5
The increase in deaths from respiratory causes with increasing exposure to ozone may
represent a combination of short-term effects of ozone on susceptible subjects who have
influenza or pneumonia and long-term effects on the respiratory system caused by airway
inflammation,24 with subsequent loss of lung function in childhood,32 young adulthood,33,34
and possibly later life.35 If exposure to ozone accelerates the natural loss of adult lung
function with age, those exposed to higher concentrations of ozone would be at greater risk
of dying from a respiratory-related syndrome.
In our two-pollutant models, the adjusted estimates of relative risk for the effect of ozone on
the risk of death from cardiovascular causes were significantly less than 1.0, seemingly
suggesting a protective effect. Such a beneficial influence of ozone, however, is unlikely
from a biologic standpoint. The association of ozone with cardiovascular end points was
sensitive to adjustment for exposure to PM2.5, making it difficult to determine precisely the
independent contributions of these copollutants to the risk of death. There was notable
collinearity between the concentrations of ozone and PM2.5.
Furthermore, measurement at central monitors probably represents population exposure to
PM2.5 more accurately than it represents exposure to ozone. Ozone concentration tends to
vary spatially within cities more than does PM2.5 concentration, because of scavenging of
ozone by nitrogen oxide near roadways.36 In the presence of a high density of local traffic,
the measurement error is probably higher for exposure to ozone than for exposure to PM2.5.
The effects of ozone could therefore be confounded by the presence of PM2.5 because of
collinearity between the measurements of the two pollutants and the higher precision of
measurements of PM2.5.37
Measurements of PM2.5 were available only for the end of the study follow-up period (1999
and 2000). Widespread collection of these data began only after the EPA adopted regulatory
limits on such particulates in 1997. Since particulate air pollution has probably decreased in
most metropolitan areas during the follow-up interval of our study, it is likely that we have
underestimated the effect of PM2.5 in our analysis.
A limitation of our study is that we were not able to account for the geographic mobility of
the population during the follow-up period. We had information on home addresses for the
CPS II cohort only at the time of initial enrollment in 1982 and 1983. Census data indicate
that during the interval between 1982 and 2000, approximately 2 to 3% of the population

NIH-PA Author Manuscriptmoved from one state to another annually (with the highest rates in an age group younger
than that of our study population).38 However, any bias due to a failure to account for
geographic mobility is likely to have attenuated, rather than exaggerated, the effects of
ozone on mortality.
In summary, we investigated the effect of tropospheric ozone on the risk of death from any
cause and cause-specific death in a large cohort, using data from 96 metropolitan statistical
areas across the United States and controlling for the effect of particulate air pollutants. We
were unable to detect a significant effect of exposure to ozone on the risk of death from
cardiovascular causes when particulates were taken into account, but we did demonstrate a
significant effect of exposure to ozone on the risk of death from respiratory causes.

† The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
‡ Occupational exposure to particulate matter increases with increasing index number. The index was calculated by assigning a relative level of exposure to PM2.5 associated with a cohort member’s job
and industry. These assignments were performed by industrial hygienists on the basis of their knowledge of typical exposure patterns for each occupation and specific job.22
§ Dietary-fat consumption increases with increasing index number. Dietary information from cohort members was used to define the level of fat consumption according to five ordered categories.20
¶ Dietary-fiber consumption increases with increasing index number. Dietary information from cohort members was used to define the level of fiber consumption according to five ordered categories.23
|| For the ecologic variables, the model included terms for influences at the level of the average for the metropolitan statistical area and at the level of the difference between the value for the ZIP Code of
residence and the average for the metropolitan statistical area to represent between- and within-metropolitan area confounding influence. Some values for ecologic variables and individual variables differ,
although they appear to measure the same risk factor. For example, for the entire cohort, the percentage of whites as listed under individual variables is 93.7, whereas the percentage of nonwhites as listed
under ecologic variables is 11.6±16.8. This apparent contradiction is explained by the fact that the former is an exact figure based on the individual reports of the study participants in the CPS II
questionnaire, whereas the latter is a mean (±SD) for the population based on Census estimates for each metropolitan statistical area.
**The Gini coefficient is a statistical dispersion measure used to calculate income inequality. The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating an equal distribution of income and 1 indicating that one
person has all the income and everyone else has no income.20 A coefficient of 0.37 indicates that on average there is a measurable inequality in the distribution of income among the different income
groups within the MSAs.
†† Average household incomes for the cohort and for each quartile of ozone concentration were calculated from the median household income for the metropolitan statistical area.

*MSA denotes metropolitan statistical area, and PM2.5 fine particulate matter consisting of particles that are 2.5 μm or less in aerodynamic diameter. Ozone concentrations were measured from April to
September during the years from 1977 to 2000, with follow-up from 1982 to 2000; changes in the concentration of PM2.5 of 10 μg per cubic meter were recorded for members of the cohort in 1999 and
2000. These models are adjusted for all the individual and ecologic risk factors listed in Table 1. For the ecologic variables, the model included terms for influences at the level of the average for the
metropolitan statistical area and at the level of the difference between the value for the ZIP Code of residence and the average for the metropolitan statistical area to represent between- and within-

"Ambient Air Pollution and Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review
of Epidemiologic Research

Departments of Epidemiology and Environmental Health Sciences, University of Michigan, School
of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI, U.S.A
Abstract
Recent experimental and epidemiologic studies have suggested air pollution as a new risk factor
for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic
studies on the association of air pollution with T2DM and related outcomes published by
December 2013. We identified 22 studies: 6 prospective studies on incident T2DM; 2 prospective
study on diabetes mortality; 4 cross-sectional studies on prevalent T2DM; 7 ecological studies on
mortality or morbidity from diabetes; and 3 studies on glucose or insulin levels. The evidence of
the association between long-term exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) and the risk of T2DM is
suggestive. The summary hazard ratio of the association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and
incident T2DM was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03–1.19) for a 10 μg/m3 increase. The evidence on the
association between long-term traffic-related exposure (measured by nitrogen dioxide or nitrogen
oxides) and the risk of T2DM was also suggestive although most studies were conducted in
women. For short-term effects of air pollution on diabetes mortality or hospital/emergency
admissions, we conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to infer a causal relationship. Because
most studies were conducted in North America or in Europe where exposure levels are relatively
low, more studies are needed in recently urbanized areas in Asia and Latin America where air
pollution levels are much higher and T2DM is an emerging public health concern.

NIH-PA Author Manuscriptcurrently 347 million people with diabetes around the world and T2DM consists of
approximately 90% of people with diabetes [2]. High fasting blood glucose was ranked as
the 7th risk factor for global disease burden and accounted for 3.4 million deaths and 3.6%
of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 [3]. While recent genome-wide
association studies have uncovered genetic variants associated with T2DM risk [4, 5], these
variants collectively account for only a small proportion of T2DM risk, suggesting a
substantial role of modifiable risk factors in the development of T2DM. Although diet and
physical activity are well established risk factors for T2DM [6], there is growing evidence
that environmental pollutants also play an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM [7].
Air pollution has been suggested as a risk factor for T2DM. Recent reviews based on animal
studies summarized potential biological mechanisms of air pollution-induced insulin
resistance and T2DM [8, 9] including particle-mediated alterations in glucose homeostasis,
inflammation in visceral adipose tissue, endoplasmic reticulum stress in liver and lung,
mitochondrial dysfunction and brown adipose tissue dysfunction, inflammation mediated
through toll-like receptors and nucleotide oligomerization domain receptors, and
inflammatory signaling in key regions of the hypothalamus. Epidemiologic studies of air
pollution and T2DM have provided mixed results [10–29]. Some studies have reported
significant positive associations, but others found no associations. To summarize
epidemiologic findings, we conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies on
the association between ambient air pollution and T2DM. We searched for studies on
incidence and prevalence of T2DM, diabetes mortality and glucose homeostatic measures
such as fasting glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-
IR), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Because of small numbers of studies identified in each
outcome and heterogeneity in air pollutants, we conducted a meta-analysis only for long-
term exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) and incident T2DM to compute a summary measure
of association. For other outcomes, we summarized each study findings descriptively.
METHODS
Search Strategy and Data Extraction
We conducted a literature search in PubMed and Web of Science on January 7, 2014 using
the following key words: (air pollution OR particulate matter OR PM10 OR PM2.5 OR
nitrogen oxides OR nitrogen dioxide OR fine particles OR coarse particles OR ozone OR
traffic particle OR traffic exhaust NOT nitric oxide) AND (type 2 diabetes OR diabetes
mellitus OR insulin OR glucose). We searched publications between January 1990 and
December 2013 given that epidemiologic studies of air pollution and type 2 diabetes
received attention just recently. In the Web of Science, we restricted articles from the
following categories: Environmental sciences; Pharmacology pharmacy; Toxicology;
Endocrinology metabolism; Public environmental occupational health; Cardiac
cardiovascular system; Medicine general internal; Multidisciplinary science. A total of 933
articles from PubMed and 481 from Web of Science were identified and the abstracts were
reviewed. Only human studies that included original data were considered. We also
excluded studies conducted in children or pregnant women (gestational diabetes), studies
with no air pollution data, studies with no effect estimate in relation to air pollution

were included in this review. We extracted the following information from each study and
summarized by study design: first author, year of publication, study population, sample size,
study (follow-up) period, age, percent of female subjects, exposure distribution (median
(interquartile range (IQR)), mean±standard deviation (SD), or range), number of cases,
covariates adjusted, and measures of association. We only considered exposure measures
from ambient concentrations of air pollutants (i.e. studies on indoor air pollution were
excluded) and did not include exposure measures from emission inventory.
Statistical Analysis
To make the reported measures of association (e.g., hazard ratio (HR), odds ratio (OR),
percent change) across studies comparable, we rescaled the effect estimates for an
interquartile range (IQR) increase and for a 10 unit (μg/m3 or ppb) increase. We conducted a
meta-analysis of the association between PM2.5 and incident T2DM with the identified 4
cohort studies [13, 15, 26]. We used a random-effects model to compute a summary HR.
Two studies reported HRs from a multi-pollutant model [15, 26]. We extracted all reported
HRs but considered the HRs from a single pollutant model in the meta-analysis. Because the
number of studies for the meta-analysis was small, we did not perform a test for publication
bias. R version 3.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, http://www.w-project.org)
with the package metafor was used.
RESULTS
We included 6 prospective cohort studies on incident T2DM; 2 prospective cohort study on
diabetes mortality; 4 cross-sectional studies on prevalence of T2DM or impaired glucose
metabolism (IGM: fasting glucose≥100 mg/dL or physician-diagnosis); 3 studies on
continuous measures of glucose homeostasis; 4 ecological studies on mortality from
diabetes; and 3 ecological studies on hospital/emergency admissions for diabetes.
Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes
We identified 6 cohort studies of incident T2DM (Table 1) [10, 13, 15, 23, 26]. Two
independent cohort studies (the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the Health Professional
Follow-up Study (HPFS)) were examined in a study by Puett and colleagues [26]. Three
studies were performed in the U.S. and one each in Germany, Denmark and Canada. Three
cohort studies (SALIA (Study on the Influence of Air Pollution on Lung, Inflammation and
Aging), BWHS (Black Women’s Health Study), and NHS) included only women and the
HPFS included only men. Incidence rates ranged from 402 per 100,000 subjects in HPFS to
1,302 per 100,000 in the Ontario residents’ study. Four studies examined either PM2.5
(annual mean ranged from 10.6 μg/m3 to 21.1 μg/m3) or PM10 (26.9 μg/m3 to 46.9 μg/m3);
three studies examined either NOx (41.6 ppb) or NO2 (15.4 to 34.5 μg/m3). For PM, all four
studies found weak positive associations and only the Ontario residents’ study reported a
statistically significant association (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.06 (95% confidence
interval (CI), 1.01, 1.11) for an IQR increase in PM2.5 (5.4 μg/m3); HR=1.11 (95% CI, 1.02,
1.21) for a 10 μg/m3 increase) [13]. The random-effect summary HR for a 10 μg/m3 increase
in PM2.5 was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.03, 1.19), with no evidence of heterogeneity among the three

NIH-PA Author Manuscriptstudies with PM2.5 measures available (test for heterogeneity: Qdf=3 = 1.08, p-value=0.78)
(Figure 1). For NO2 or NOx (traffic-related particles), two studies conducted in women’s
cohorts reported significant positive associations (HR=1.42 (95% CI, 1.16, 1.73) for NO2
(IQR=15 μg/m3) in SALIA; HR=1.25 (95% CI, 1.07, 1.46) for NOx (IQR=12.4 ppb) in
BWHS), whereas the Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health (DCH) study found no association
when all cases of T2DM were examined but found a weak marginal association when only
confirmed T2DM cases were considered (HR=1.04 (95% CI, 1.00, 1.08) for NO2 (IQR=4.9
μg/m3)).
Two studies examined long-term exposure to air pollution and incident diabetes mortality
[30, 27]. In a study conducted in Denmark (the DHC cohort study followed from 1993 to
2009, N=52,061, 122 cases), an IQR increase in NO2 (IQR=4.9 μg/m3) averaged from 1971
to the follow-up period was associated with a HR for diabetes equal to 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99,
1.32) [27]. A large national follow-up study conducted in Canada (The 1991 Canadian
census mortality follow-up from 1991 to 2001, N=2,145,400, 5,200 cases) found a
significant positive association between average concentrations of PM2.5 for the period from
2001 to 2006 and diabetes mortality (HR=1.28 (95% CI, 1.22, 1.35) for an IQR increase in
PM2.5 (6.2 μg/m3) [30].
Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes
Four studies (three observational and one ecological) reported cross-sectional associations
between long-term air pollution and prevalence of T2DM or IGM (Table 1). Two
observational cross-sectional studies performed in Canada and The Netherlands examined
annual NO2 concentrations as the exposure measure, whereas the SALIA study (Germany)
examined various air pollution measures including PM2.5, PM10–2.5, PM10, NO2 and NOx.
The ecological study conducted in the U.S. was based on county-levels of diabetes
prevalence and PM2.5 annual concentrations in 2004 and 2005 (n=2,754 counties). In
patients from a respiratory disease clinic from Hamilton (N=5,228, prevalence of
T2DM=15%) and Toronto (N=2,406, prevalence of T2DM=17%), Canada, an IQR increase
in NO2 was positively associated with T2DM among women (OR=1.08 (95% CI, 0.94, 1.26)
in Hamilton; OR=1.23 (95% CI, 1.00, 1.50) in Toronto) but not men (OR=1.03 (95% CI,
0.85, 1.20) in Hamilton; OR=0.92 (95% CI, 0.74, 1.09) in Toronto) [11]. In a study of 8,018
residents (prevalence of T2DM=8%) from Westfriesland, Netherlands, NO2 was not
associated with the prevalence of T2DM [17]. A study conducted in the SALIA cohort,
Germany (N=363, 100% women, prevalence of IGM=48%) found significant positive
associations of IGM with NO2 (OR=1.47 (95% CI, 1.05, 2.05) per IQR increase) and NOx
(OR=1.41 (95% CI, 1.01, 1.97)) [28]. Finally, in an ecological study of the association
between county-level PM2.5 concentrations and diabetes prevalence in the US [25], a 10
μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 1.15% (95% CI, 1.02, 1.32%) increase in the
diabetes prevalence in 2004 and a 0.92% (95% CI, 0.75, 1.13%) increase in 2005.
Air Pollution and Measures of Glucose Homeostasis
Three studies evaluated continuous measures of glucose homeostasis (Table 2) [12, 14, 21].
A study from Taiwan examined the associations with long-term exposures (annual
concentrations) to 5 criteria pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and O3), whereas two

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscriptstudies from Korea and Michigan, U.S. examined short-term exposures (up to 7-day lags of
PM10, NO2, SO2 and O3 in the Korean study; 5-day long exposure to PM2.5 in the U.S.
study). All three examined fasting glucose levels; a study from Taiwan additionally
examined hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a measure of glycated hemoglobin in red blood cells
that reflects average glucose level over the previous 3 months [31]; two studies from Korea
and Michigan, U.S. examined fasting insulin and an indicator of insulin resistance
(homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) [12, 21]. In a study of 1,023
participants from the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study in Taiwan, fasting
glucose and HbA1c were associated with all criteria pollutants except SO2 [14]. A study of
560 older people in Korea reported that short-term exposure to PM10, NO2 and O3 but not
SO2 were associated with increased fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR, which suggests
reduced metabolic insulin sensitivity [21]. A human panel study with 25 healthy non-
smoking adults conducted in Michigan, U.S. also found that sub-acute exposure to PM2.5 (5-
day-long cumulative exposure) was associated with increased fasting glucose, insulin and
HOMA-IR [12].
Short-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Mortality from Diabetes
We identified four ecological studies (Poisson time-series or case-crossover design studies)
of short-term exposure to air pollution and mortality from diabetes (Table 3) [18–20, 24].
These studies included both type-1 and type 2 diabetes. In a study conducted in Montreal,
Canada between 1984 and 1993, the estimated percent change in daily diabetes mortality for
an IQR increase in air pollution was 13.2% (95% CI, 2.69%, 24.8%) for PM10, 12.0% (95%
CI, 3.01%, 21.8%) for PM2.5, and 3.79%, (95% CI, 0.69%, 6.98%) for sulfate (predicted
from PM2.5). In a latter study conducted between 1990 and 2003 the corresponding percent
changes were 3.45% (95% CI, 1.29%, 5.66%) for NO2, 2.74% (95% CI, 0.75%, 4.77%) for
CO and 1.89%, (95% CI, 0.05%, 3.76%) for SO2 [19]. In a time-series study using daily
mortality from diabetes between 2001 and 2002 conducted in Shanghai, China observed
marginal associations with PM10 (4.18% (95% CI, 0.00%, 8.54%) per IQR increase) and
SO2 (3.82%, (95% CI, 0.00%, 7.78%)) [20]. In Massachusetts, U.S., black carbon (5.7%,
(95% CI, −1.7%, 13.7%)) and sulfate (2.9%, (95% CI, −3.1%, 9.5%)) were positively but
non-significantly associated with the deaths from diabetes for the years 1995–2002 [24].
Short-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Hospital/Emergency Admissions for Diabetes
Three studies examined hospital/emergency admissions for diabetes using the time-series
Poisson model analysis or the case-crossover design (Table 3) [16, 22, 29]. These studies
also included both type-1 and type 2 diabetes. Two studies by Zanobetti et al. [29] and Dales
et al. [16] examined short-term exposures to air pollution and one study by Kloog et al. [22]
examined both short-term and long-term effects of PM2.5. Zanobetti et al. found that a 10
μg/m3 increase in 2-day averaged PM2.5 was associated with a 2.74% (95% CI, 1.30, 4.20%)
increase in emergency admissions for diabetes in 26 U.S. communities between 2000 and
2003 [29]. In a study from Santiago, Chile between 2001 and 2008, Dales et al. found that
IQR increases in criteria pollutants except ozone were associated with an 11% to a 15%
increase in the risk for hospitalization for diabetes [16]. In a study conducted in New
England, U.S., a 10 μg/m3 increase in short-term and long-term PM2.5 was associated with a

for diabetes hospitalization, respectively [22].
DISCUSSION
In general, two different study designs were used to examine the association between air
pollution and T2DM: observational studies of incidence, prevalence or mortality from
T2DM or continuous measures of insulin resistance in relation to long-term exposure to air
pollution; and ecological studies of daily mortality or hospital/emergency admissions in
relation to short-term exposure. For the incidence and prevalence studies and observational
diabetes mortality studies, either annual concentrations of particulate matters (mostly PM2.5
or PM10 and PM10–2.5 (coarse particles)) or nitrogen oxides (NOx or NO2) which were
estimated using land-use regression [10, 11, 15, 17, 26–28, 30] or satellite-based approach
[13] were used as exposure metrics, whereas ecological studies of DM mortality or hospital/
emergency admissions (except the study by Kloog et al. [22]) used daily concentrations of
criteria pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3) based on central monitoring or the
nearest monitors. Given the differences in study design and disease etiology between long-
term air pollution effects on the development of T2DM vs. short-term air pollution effects
on daily diabetes mortality or morbidity, we discussed causal relationships based on
epidemiologic findings by these two study designs separately.
Observational Studies in Relation to Long-Term Exposure
Consistency—For PM2.5, all studies showed positive associations with either incident
T2DM [13, 15, 23, 26], diabetes mortality [30] or prevalent IGM [28]. Our meta-analysis
suggests an association between PM2.5 and incident T2DM with a small summary HR of
1.11 (95% CI, 1.03, 1.19). One large national-level study examined more than 2 millions of
Canadians showed a strong positive association between PM2.5 and diabetes mortality. For
NO2 or NOx, a measure of traffic particle exposure, three studies from two women’s cohorts
(SALIA and BWHS) reported a significant association with incident T2DM [15, 23] or
prevalent IGM [28], and one relatively large study from Denmark (approximately 52,000
participants) also reported a significant association with confirmed T2DM (but not with all
cases of T2DM) [10] or diabetes mortality [27]. Two other cross-sectional studies also found
a suggestive association with prevalent T2DM only among women [11, 17].
Strength—One Canadian census mortality study and two women’s cohort studies (SALIA
and BWHS) reported relatively strong associations (HRs from 1.25 to 1.42 for an IQR
increase in PM2.5, NOx or NO2), whereas other studies reported modest associations (i.e.,
HRs or ORs <1.1). Although most studies used land-use regression models to generate
improved exposure estimates, the use of stationary monitoring data rather than personal
monitoring may lead to exposure measurement error. Another potential source of exposure
measurement error is that one year average concentrations prior to baseline or at any given
year are used as proxies for the long-term exposure. Exposure measurement error may occur
if individual exposure levels have changed over time before baseline, for example, if
individuals have moved often before baseline. These errors generally bias the observed
association towards the null.

NIH-PA Author ManuscriptTemporality—Eight prospective studies have examined incident T2DM or diabetes
mortality which supports the temporality issue that the cause precedes the effect in time.
Reverse causation is unlikely given that onset of T2DM may not lead to an increase in air
pollution exposure.
Biological Plausibility—As introduced early, several animal studies support potential
biological mechanisms, for example, cumulative exposure to air pollution can lead to a
reduction in Akt phosphorylation in the liver, skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue
which influences insulin signaling pathway and apoptosis [32, 33]. Fine particulate matter
exposure can induce inflammation in visceral adipose tissue by increasing adipose tissue
macrophages [34]. PM2.5 exposure may also induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress not
only in the lung but in the liver which induces hepatic insulin resistance [35]. These
mechanisms eventually affect insulin resistance and cause T2DM [8, 9].
Causal Inference—Based on consistency of the observed findings, the evidence of the
association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the risk of T2DM is suggestive. The
vast majority of studies were conducted in North America or Europe and little evidence was
reported from other areas. The evidence on the association between long-term traffic-related
exposure (measured by nitrogen dioxide or nitrogen oxides) and the risk of T2DM is also
suggestive although most studies were conducted in women. The fact that two primary
studies showing significant associations between traffic exposure and incident T2DM were
conducted in women’s cohorts and most other studies have reported a significant association
only among women suggests that women may be more susceptible to air pollution-related
response to T2DM. It is unclear that the stronger associations in women are consequences of
sex-related biological differences or gender-related behavioral or social differences [36]
which needs further investigation.
Ecological Studies in Relation to Short-Term Exposure
Consistency and Strength—For mortality from T2DM, three studies examined either
PM10 or PM2.5: a time-series study from Shanghai, China found a marginal association [20].
In studies done in Montreal, Canada, the earlier study that examined mortality between 1984
and 1993 in which the median concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 28.5 and 14.7 μg/m3
reported a significant association (12% and 13% increases in DM mortality per IQR increase
in PM2.5 and PM10, respectively) [18], whereas a more recent study that examined mortality
between 1990 and 2003 in which the median PM2.5 concentration was 6.9 μg/m3 found no
association [19]. For hospital/emergency admissions, all three studies reported significant
associations with PM2.5. Two U.S. studies where PM2.5 concentrations were 9 to 15 μg/m3
reported weak positive associations (0.96% and 2.74% per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5),
whereas a time-series study done in Santiago, Chile where PM2.5 concentrations were two-
fold higher (the median PM2.5 =31.5 μg/m3) found a 6% increased risk per 10 μg/m3
increase in PM2.5.
Biological Plausibility—For short-term exposure, it is unclear if mortality from diabetes
or hospital/emergency admissions to diabetes was due to diabetes-related complications by
dysfunctions of serum glucose control or due to acute exacerbation of other pre-existing

NIH-PA Author Manuscriptdiseases [16]. Short-term exposure to particulate matters or ozone is known to induce
oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiac autonomic
nervous system dysfunction [37], which may lead to insulin dysregulation [38, 39]. A
human panel study conducted in Michigan, U.S. found that sub-acute exposure to PM2.5 was
associated with reduced metabolic insulin sensitivity as measured by increased HOMA-IR
and reduced heart rate variability [12], which supports the plausibility that air pollution, not
only long-term but relatively short-term exposure, could influence insulin and glucose
homeostasis.
Temporality—The temporality issue in ecological time-series studies has been assured by
examining the lagged effects [40]. Nonetheless, most studies explored only short lagged-
exposure periods, such as 0 or 1-day lag or a 2-day distributed lag because many previous
studies of total and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity reported larger associations with
particle exposures at 0 to 2-day lags. Whether short-term air pollution exposure has
immediate effects on glucose and insulin functions or more delayed effects remains to be
explored in the future.
Causal Inference—We conclude that the evidence is not sufficient to infer a causal
relationship of short-term exposure to air pollution and mortality or hospital/emergency
admissions to diabetes. Although a few studies suggest potential mechanisms, those are not
specific to glucose and insulin actions and direct mechanisms are unknown. Most previous
studies examined diabetes mortality and morbidity along with cardiovascular and respiratory
outcomes.
CONCLUSION
Our systematic review suggests that the evidence is suggestive to infer causal relationship
between fine particle exposure and the risk of T2DM and there is suggestive evidence of the
association between traffic-related exposure and incident T2DM especially in women.
Because most studies were conducted in North America or in Europe where exposure levels
are relatively low, more studies are needed in recently urbanized areas in Asia and Latin
America where air pollution levels are much higher and T2DM is an emerging public health
concern [41, 42] to increase the power and to determine the dose-response relationships.

aAn elevated plasma glucose concentration was defined as a fasting plasma glucose > 140 mg/dL for cases diagnosed before or during 1997 or > 126 mg/dL for cases diagnosed after 1997, a random plasma glucose concentration > 200 mg/dL, or a plasma glucose concentration
> 200 mg/dL after >2 hr of oral glucose tolerance testing.
bThe National Diabetes Registry (NDR) included 1) diabetes hospital discharge diagnoses in the National Patient Register defined as ICD-10 (DE10-14, DH36.0, DO24) or ICD-8 (249 and 250); 2) chiropody for diabetes patients, five blood glucose measurements within 1 year,
or two blood glucose measurements per year for 5 consecutive years, registered in the National Health Insurance Registry; or 3) second purchase of insulin or oral glucose-lowering drugs within 6 months, registered in the Register of Medicinal Product Statistics. Type 1 and type
2 diabetes are not distinguishable from NDR.
cThe Ontario Diabetes Database included information on hospital admission with a diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9 250 or ICD-10 E10–E14) or ≥2 physician claims for diabetes within a 2-year period. Gestational diabetes was excluded. It has been validated (86% sensitivity and
97% specificity).

"Lung cancer mortality from exposure to chrysotile
asbestos and smoking: a caseecontrol study within
a cohort in China
Eiji Yano,1 Xiaorong Wang,2 Mianzhen Wang,3 Hong Qiu,2 Zhiming Wang3
ABSTRACT
Objective To conﬁrm the association between exposure
to chrysotile asbestos and lung cancer risk and to
demonstrate the combined effect of smoking and
asbestos exposure.
Methods A caseecontrol study of 1139 asbestos
workers identiﬁed 41 male lung cancer cases in 2001;
each case was matched by age (65 years) with ﬁve
controls. Workers in seven workshops were categorised
into high-, medium- and low-exposure subgroups, and
conditional logistic regression was applied to estimate
the odds ratios for lung cancer risk associated with the
different exposure levels. Smoking, age at ﬁrst exposure,
and exposure duration were considered as covariates/
confounding factors. A joint effect of asbestos exposure
and smoking on lung cancer risk was analysed using
a conditional logistical model.
Results 54% of cases had high exposure and 24% low
exposure, while 24% of controls had high exposure and
44% low exposure. Smoking was more common in cases
(90%) than in controls (73%). The adjusted OR for lung
cancer was 3.66 (95% CI 1.61 to 8.29) for high exposure
and was elevated slightly for medium exposure (1.25;
95% CI 0.47 to 3.31). Smoking was related to lung
cancer risk (OR 3.33; 95% CI 1.10 to 10.08). In
comparison with the low-exposure non-smoking group,
the OR for the high-exposure smoking group was 10.39
(1.34 to 82.45), in contrast to 5.23 (0.50 to 54.58) for
high-exposure non-smoking workers.
Conclusions These results conﬁrm the strong
association between exposure to chrysotile asbestos and
lung cancer risk, and support an interactive effect of
asbestos exposure and smoking which is more than
additive.
INTRODUCTION
The carcinogenicity of asbestos is well documented.
Many countries, including Japan, have banned the
production and use of asbestos, whereas some other
countries, including China, continue to produce
and use huge amounts of chrysotile asbestos in
construction
materials.
Even
where
banned,
asbestos continues to create many problems. For
example, although domestic asbestos production is
negligible in Japan, the country has in the past
imported more than 10 million tons of asbestos,
most of which remains in buildings and other
structures. Asbestos removal and site cleaning have
placed an enormous burden on society. Moreover,
because of the long latency of asbestos-related
diseases, health problems may emerge long after
actual exposure. For example, in Amagasaki, Japan
in 2005, several cases of mesothelioma were found
among residents living in the vicinity of a former
asbestos plant.1 This prompted nationwide concern
about asbestos, and many similar cases were
subsequently discovered and reported from other
areas of the country.
There has been growing agreement in the scien-
tiﬁc
community
that
exposure
to
chrysotile
asbestos, which is the most common type of
asbestos currently produced and used, is associated
with an increased risk of lung cancer,2e5 although
the relationship between exposure to chrysotile
asbestos and mesothelioma remains contentious.6 7
To control exposure to remaining asbestos and to
compensate those with health damage due to
asbestos exposure, it is important to establish
doseeresponse
relationships
between
asbestos
exposure and diseases. However, sufﬁcient infor-
mation to assess asbestos exposure is usually
lacking.
We previously reported the results of a 25-year
follow-up observational study of a ﬁxed cohort of
515 Chinese male workers in an asbestos textile
plant. We found excessive lung cancer mortality
associated with exposure to chrysotile asbestos in
these workers.8 In the current nested caseecontrol
study, we further investigated the relationship
between lung cancer and different levels of expo-
sure to chrysotile asbestos. The combined effect of
smoking and asbestos was also examined.
What this paper adds
< Differences in the carcinogenic potency of
different asbestos ﬁbre types are debated in
the scientiﬁc community.
< There is growing agreement that exposure to
chrysotile is associated with increased risk for
lung cancer, but more evidence is needed
concerning the strength of the association and
its interaction with smoking.
< This nested caseecontrol study conducted in
textile workers suggests a strong association
between exposure to chrysotile asbestos and
lung cancer risk.
< The result also supports a synergistic effect of
asbestos exposure and smoking that is more
than additive.
< The study delivers a strong message to policy
makers
that
exposure
to
chrysotile
is
dangerous.

Original articleSTUDY SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study subjects and controls were selected from an open
cohort of asbestos workers in an asbestos textile plant in China.
Cohort recruitment began in January 1972 and was open to
those working in the plant between that time and November
1996. The ﬁnal cohort consisting of 1139 male workers was
followed for the occurrence of lung cancer until 2001. Nearly
half of the members entered the cohort in 1972 and thus were
followed for 30 years. All of the members were actively working
in the plant and had no signs of overt cardiopulmonary disease
at the time of cohort entry. According to plant records, only
chrysotile asbestos had been used to produce asbestos textiles,
cement products, friction materials, rubber products and heat-
resistant materials in the plant since 1939. Although we were
not able to obtain samples representative of all of the chrysotile
historically used in the plant, available samples of chrysotile
assessed in 2000 by x-ray diffraction analysis and analytical
transmission
electron microscopy revealed that amphibole
contamination was very low (<0.001% tremolite ﬁbre).8
By the end of 2001, a total of 196 workers in the cohort had
died, with 64 of these deaths occurring during the last 5 years.
Forty-one lung cancer cases were identiﬁed from death certiﬁ-
cates. These workers with lung cancers were selected as cases,
and each was matched by age at the time of death (65 years)
with
ﬁve
controls
using
the
incidence
density
sampling
method.9 This approach randomly selected controls from the
original cohort, taking into account follow-up status, that is,
controls were alive, and exposure status, that is, exposure for
controls was only counted prior to the date of the case’s death.
Thus, 41 cases and 205 controls were included in the data
analysis. The workers were divided into seven job types and
further categorised into three exposure groups based on the
dust/ﬁbre concentrations measured at major workshops and
locations where the employees usually worked: (1) high-expo-
sure group, including workers in the raw material and textile
(carding, spinning and weaving) sections; (2) medium-exposure
group, including those in the rubber section, and with job titles
of maintenance and cleaning; and (3) low-exposure group,
including those in the cement section and administration.8
Assigning the job categories of maintenance and cleaning to
medium exposure, and administration to low exposure was
based on industrial hygiene parameters. Smoking information
was collected by face-to-face interview during the follow-up
period. Subjects were classiﬁed as non-smokers and ever
smokers; the latter was deﬁned as having smoked at least one
cigarette per day for 6 months or longer. The study was
approved
by
the
Human
Subject
Committees
of
Teikyo
University and Huaxi School of Public Health.
We applied conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds
ratios for lung cancer risk associated with the different levels of
exposure, as represented by the three exposure groups, where
those working in cement and administration (low exposure)
served as a reference group. The other covariates/confounding
factors considered included smoking status, age when cases died
or age at ﬁrst exposure, and exposure duration. We also assessed
the joint effect of asbestos exposure and smoking on lung cancer
risk, using conditional logistical regression taking into account
age and exposure duration. In this analysis, we created ﬁve
dummy variables based on combinations of the three exposure
levels with smoking status. We deﬁned those who did not smoke
and who had a low exposure level (ie, working in the cement
shop or administration) as the reference group. Finally, we
estimated an interaction between exposure to asbestos and
cigarette smoking in these subjects by calculating a synergy
index (S) and its 95% CI. S is deﬁned as the ratio of the observed
effects of combined exposure to the two agents to the sum of
the estimated separate effect of each10:
S¼

ORjoint effect of asbestos smoke  1

½ðORasbestos  1Þ
þ ðORsmoke  1Þ
In this analysis, S is the ratio of the excess risk in the group of
high-exposure smokers to the sum of the excess risks in the low-
exposure smokers and high-exposure non-smokers. The odds
ratio used in the formula was adjusted for age and exposure
duration. The 95% CI of S was calculated using the delta
method described by Hosmer and Lemeshow.11 All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows, and the
synergy index and 95% CI were calculated using an Excel sheet
available at http://www.epinet.se.12
RESULTS
The average age in both cases and controls was 66 years. The age
at ﬁrst exposure and number of years working in the asbestos
plant were comparable between the two groups (table 1). In the
cases, 54% were classiﬁed as having high asbestos exposure, and
24% as having low exposure; in contrast, 24% and 44% of the
controls were classiﬁed as having high and low exposure,
respectively. The differences between the two groups were
statistically
signiﬁcant.

Original articlecommon in the cases (90%) than in the controls (73%). In
addition, asbestosis was diagnosed in 16 cases (39%) and 37
controls (19%). All lung cancer cases had died, while 43 controls
had died of non-malignant diseases.
Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk for lung cancer in
the high-exposure group was over three times that in the
reference group (OR 3.66; 95% CI 1.61 to 8.29) (table 2), and the
difference was statistically signiﬁcant. Medium exposure was
associated with a slightly increased risk, which was not
statistically signiﬁcant (OR 1.25; 95% CI 0.47 to 3.31). Smoking
was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk for lung cancer,
which was more than three times higher than that for non-
smoking. No effect of age or exposure duration was observed,
and there was no association between age at ﬁrst exposure and
cancer risk. When the interaction term of asbestos exposure and
smoking was placed into the model, the OR in relation to high
exposure and smoking was 0.65 (95% CI 0.05 to 8.06), in
comparison with the combination low exposure and non-
smoking.
In the joint effect analysis, no case in the group of non-
smokers had medium exposure (table 3). In comparison with the
reference group (low-level asbestos exposure and non-smoking),
all of the groups showed increased risk for lung cancer. There
was an exposureeresponse trend in smokers: those with high
asbestos exposure had a 10-fold greater risk. Despite a wide
range in the conﬁdence intervals, the odds ratio reached statis-
tical signiﬁcance. Smokers with medium exposure had an OR of
4.3, similar to the risk in non-smokers with a high exposure
level, and smokers with a low exposure level had an OR of 3.0,
neither of which was signiﬁcant. The results indicated a joint
effect of exposure to asbestos and smoking, and the potential
synergic effect is further illustrated in ﬁgure 1. The calculated
synergy index (S) was 1.55 (95% CI 0.43 to 5.67), which implies
that the combined effect of high exposure and smoking was
greater than additive. However, statistical signiﬁcance was not
reached, possibly because of inadequate statistical power arising
from the small numbers available for subgroup analysis.
DISCUSSION
The strength of the association between exposure to chrysotile
asbestos and lung cancer remains a topic of interest in the
scientiﬁc community. In addition to workers occupationally
exposed to asbestos, the general population are also at risk, as
substantial amounts of commercial asbestos products (mainly
chrysotile) remain in the environment in many countries.1 13
Globally, an estimated 125 million people are occupationally
exposed to asbestos annually, and 90 000 die each year from
asbestos-related diseases.14 Even in countries with total bans on
the use of asbestos, new cases of asbestos-related cancer are
likely to continue to emerge because of the long latency between
exposure and disease onset.
Our study used a nested caseecontrol design to assess the
association between lung cancer and exposure to chrysotile.
Overall, the study subjects were heavily exposed to chrysotile
asbestos. The total dust concentrations in the work areas always
exceeded 3 mg/m3, and personal samples taken for ﬁbre analysis
exceeded 3 ﬁbres/ml, except in the cement workshop, where the
ﬁbre count was very low.8 According to historical records,
exposure levels were much higher during the 1940s and 1970s.
Available
samples
of
chrysotile
revealed
that
amphibole
contamination was very low. However, it should be pointed out
that samples available for analysis may not have been fully
representative of historical use of chrysotile at this plant. It was
possible that contamination by amphiboles varied in previously
used raw materials that were not analysed. This was indicated
in our recent case report of mesothelioma from the same plant,
where tremolite was found in lung tissue.15 Nevertheless, there
was no doubt that chrysotile was the predominant type of
asbestos to which workers were exposed in this plant. After
categorising the workers into three exposure levels, we observed
a 3.6-fold increased risk for lung cancer in those with high
exposure, that is, those working in the raw material and textile
sections, which was signiﬁcantly higher than that observed in
those with low exposure. This association was independent of
smoking, although smoking was also found to be a strong risk
factor. This result conﬁrms the strong association of chrysotile
asbestos with lung cancer.
The difference in carcinogenic potency among the various
types of asbestos ﬁbres has been debated in the scientiﬁc
community for more than 20 years. Many arguments against
the amphibole hypothesis have been presented, asserting that
there is virtually no difference between the risks for lung cancer
presented by the different ﬁbre types.5 7 16 Evidence also exists
that chrysotile, crocidolite and amosite have produced similar
levels of lung tumours in animal inhalation experiments.2

suggesting
that
the
amphibole
hypothesis is not applicable to asbestos-related lung cancer. A
recent study of North Carolina asbestos textile workers who
were exposed to chrysotile also reported signiﬁcantly higher
than expected mortality from lung cancer, and an increased risk
with cumulative exposure to asbestos ﬁbres.5 On the other
hand, studies in chrysotile cohorts have produced a wide range
of risk estimations, for example, a low risk was estimated for
Quebec chrysotile mine workers19 and a high risk estimation
was reported for South Carolina textile workers.4 Similar
heterogeneity in risk estimations and exposureeresponse asso-
ciations was noted in asbestos textile workers who used the
same form of asbestos.7 17 20 Exposure level may be one of the
factors determining the magnitude of risk. Asbestos-related
diseases, including lung cancer, have often been clearly evident in
workers with heavy chrysotile exposures.17 This may be
attributable to the greater solubility of chrysotile in the lung,
which may also partly explain the positive association observed
in the present study. It should be noted that our control group
was also exposed to asbestos. If the cases in the present study
were to be compared with controls without asbestos exposure,
and especially without smoking, the estimated risk for lung
cancer might be even greater.
The joint effect of smoking and asbestos exposure on lung
cancer risk has been documented. Considerable clinical and
epidemiological evidence substantiates the fact that cigarette
smoking exacerbates asbestos-induced lung cancer and that
a large proportion of asbestos workers are also smokers. For
example, more than 70% of the workers in the cohort from
which the subjects were selected for the present study were
smokers. Although a joint effect of smoking and asbestos is
biologically plausible and observable, the form and magnitude of
the combined effect remain inconclusive for certain conditions.
Overall, evidence now indicates that the interaction of the two
factors is more than additive.17 21 It has been suggested that the
combined effect of asbestos exposure and smoking reﬂects the
facts that both factors are complex carcinogens, both can be
genotoxic and cytotoxic, and both can affect more than one
stage of lung carcinogenesis.22 The present study is consistent
with a joint effect of high exposure and smoking greater than
the sum of the individual effects, with a synergy index of 1.55,
supporting the ﬁnding that the excess lung cancer risk arising
from the combination of asbestos exposure and smoking was
greater than the sum of the two separate excess risks.23 Statis-
tical signiﬁcance, however, was absent. This might be due to
inadequate statistical power in the subgroup analysis. Besides,
using non-smokers without exposure to asbestos as a reference
group might have resulted in a greater joint effect.
The major strength of this study was that unlike typical
caseecontrol studies, both the cases and controls were selected
from the same cohort that had been followed from 1972 to 2001.
Thus selection bias was not a major concern. The appearance of
disease began to rapidly increase as the cohort aged. This study
has a few limitations that need to be pointed out. One of them
is the small number of cases, although each case was matched
with ﬁve controls. Inadequate statistical power owing to small
sample size was especially evident in the wide conﬁdence
intervals in the subgroup analysis determining the joint effect.
Another limitation is that only about half of the lung cancer
cases had pathological diagnoses, either by biopsy or autopsy.
The remaining cases were diagnosed on the basis of CT and
clinical course. Thus, there might have been some ambiguity in
the diagnoses. Nevertheless, we believe that the proportion of
misdiagnoses is small. The measure of smoking in this study was
dichotomous, and detailed quantitative information on smoking
was unavailable, which prohibited us from further determining
an association with the extent of smoking. Data for asbestosis
were available in this study. However, x-ray ﬁlms taken before
the 1980s were of poor quality. In addition, the ILO classiﬁca-
tion24 1/0 is not classiﬁed as pneumoconiosis in the Chinese
diagnostic criteria, which might have led to an underestimate of
asbestosis in the subjects. Therefore, we did not include asbes-
tosis in the multivariate analysis.
In summary, the present study conﬁrms the strong associa-
tion between exposure to chrysotile asbestos and risk for lung
cancer, and supports a more-than-additive effect of exposure to
asbestos and smoking. Given our reference group consisting of
workers exposed to low levels of asbestos, the risk for lung
cancer associated with exposure to chrysotile could be even
greater if non-smokers without asbestos exposure were used as
a reference group.

Abstract
Background: Both road traffic noise and ambient air pollution have been associated with risk for ischemic heart disease, but
only few inconsistent studies include both exposures.
Methods: In a population-based cohort of 57 053 people aged 50 to 64 years at enrolment in 1993–1997, we identified
1600 cases of first-ever MI between enrolment and 2006. The mean follow-up time was 9.8 years. Exposure to road traffic
noise and air pollution from 1988 to 2006 was estimated for all cohort members from residential address history.
Associations between exposure to road traffic noise and incident MI were analysed in a Cox regression model with
adjustment for air pollution (NOx) and other potential confounders: age, sex, education, lifestyle confounders, railway and
airport noise.
Results: We found that residential exposure to road traffic noise (Lden) was significantly associated with MI, with an
incidence rate ratio IRR of 1.12 per 10 dB for both of the two exposure windows: yearly exposure at the time of diagnosis
(95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02–1.22) and 5-years time-weighted mean (95% CI: 1.02–1.23) preceding the diagnosis.
Visualizing of the results using restricted cubic splines showed a linear dose-response relationship.
Conclusions: Exposure to long-term residential road traffic noise was associated with a higher risk for MI, in a dose-
dependent manner.

Introduction
Increasing noise from traffic occurs in parallel with urbanisa-
tion. Noise acts as a stressor provoking a typical stress response,
with hyperactivity of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system
followed by elevated blood pressure, heart rate and vasoconstric-
tion [1]. Furthermore, noise affects the hypothalamus-pituitary-
adrenal axis, leading to increased levels of cortisol [2]. In addition,
exposure to noise during the night at normal urban levels has been
associated with sleep disturbances
[3], which might affect
metabolic and endocrine function [4,5] and impair the immune
system [6,7].
In 2008 a meta-analysis identified seven studies which had
investigated the association between road traffic noise and
myocardial infarction (MI) using objective noise exposure with
multiple categories and control for confounding as inclusion
criteria [8]. The study found no effect of noise in cross-sectional
studies, whereas in case-control and cohort studies there seemed to
be a higher risk for MI at exposures to noise levels above 60 dB,
though statistically insignificant for all exposure groups. None of
the studies in the meta-analysis included adjustment by air
pollution, which might be important as road traffic noise and
ambient air pollution correlate [9,10] and both exposures have
been linked to MI [8,11]. Recently, two studies have investigated
the joint effect of road traffic noise and air pollution on ischemic
heart disease with mixed results [9,12]. While Selander et al. found
that road traffic noise seemed to increase the risk for incident MI
after adjustment for air pollution (NO2), Beelen et al. found that
after adjustment for black smoke and traffic intensity there was no

ischemic heart disease.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association
between residential exposure to road traffic noise and risk for
incident MI in a large prospective cohort after adjustment for
exposure to air pollution and other important risk factors for MI.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the regional ethic committee for
Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. Participation in the Diet, Cancer
and Health cohort was based on written informed consent.
Study population
The study was based on the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort
[13]. In total, 57,053 of 160,725 residents of Copenhagen or
Aarhus aged 50–64 years without a history of cancer were enrolled
into the cohort between 1993 and 1997. Participants had to be
born in Denmark. At enrolment, each participant completed self-
administered, interviewer-checked, questionnaires covering food
intake, lifestyle habits including detailed information on present
and previous smoking and physical activity, health status including
self-reported information on diabetes and social factors. Also,
trained staff members measured brachial artery blood pressure at
enrolment using automated TAKEDA UA 751 or UA 743
Oscillometers once. The measurement was conducted in the
supine position after a minimum of 5 minutes rest and at least
30 minutes after tobacco smoking and intake of food, tea or coffee.
If systolic BP was 160 mm Hg or more, or diastolic BP was 95 mm
Hg or more, the measurement was repeated after an interval of at
least 3 min and the lowest measurement of the two was used. Also,
non-fasting total cholesterol (mmol/L) of each individual was
determined in whole blood on the day of enrolment using a
LipotrendH C device with Lipotrend test strips (Boehringer
Mannheim). The sample was applied onto the test strip by means
of a plastic capillary. The study was conducted in accordance with
the Helsinki Declaration.
Identification of outcome
The endpoint was incident MI (International Classification of
Disease (ICD) 10: I21.0-I21.9), and potential cases were identified
by linkage to the Danish National Hospital Registry [14] and the
Danish Causes of Death Registry [15]. Furthermore, we included
participants with a sudden cardiac death diagnosis (ICD 10: I46.0-
I46.9) if cardiac arrest after validation by medical records was
believed to be caused by an MI. From baseline through 2003
potential cases were validated by direct review of medical records
in accordance with the guidelines of the American Heart
Association and the European Society of Cardiology for use in
epidemiology [16]. From January 2004 until end of follow-up (27
June 2006) and for participants whose medical records were not
available for review in the period from 1993–2003, we accepted all
participants with a diagnosis of MI (ICD 10: I21.0-I21.9) from a
ward as cases without further validation, because these diagnoses
have been found to have a positive predictive value above 90% in
the Danish National Patient Registry [16]. Fatal MI was defined as
death within 30 days.
Exposure assessment
A complete residential address history between 1988 and event
or censoring date was collected for 93 % of the cohort members.
Exposure to road traffic noise was calculated for the years 1990,
1995, 2000 and 2005 using SoundPLAN (version 6.5, http://
www.soundplan.dk/) for all present and historical residential
addresses at which these cohort members had lived between 1988
and event/censoring. This noise calculation program implements
the joint Nordic prediction method for road traffic noise, which
has been the standard method for noise calculation in Scandinavia
during many years [17].
The input variables for the noise model were: point for noise
estimation (geographical coordinates and height of the floor); road
links with information on annual average daily traffic, vehicle
distribution, travel speed and road type (motorway, express road,
road wider than 6m, road less than 6m and more than 3m, and
other road); and building polygons for all buildings, including
information on building height. We obtained traffic counts for all
Danish roads with more than 1000 vehicles per day from the
Danish municipalities as well as from a central database covering
all the major state and county roads. We assumed that the terrain
was flat, which is a reasonable assumption in Denmark, and that
urban areas, roads and areas with water were hard surfaces
whereas all other areas were acoustically porous. No information
was available on noise barriers. Road traffic noise was calculated
as the equivalent continuous A-weighted sound pressure level
(LAeq) at the most exposed facade of the dwelling at each address
for the day (Ld; 07:00–19:00 h), evening (Le; 19:00–22:00 h) and
night (Ln; 22:00–07:00 h) and expressed as Lden by applying a 5-
dB penalty for the evening and a 10-dB penalty for the night.[18]
Similar to a previous study we used a cut-off value of 42 dB [9], as
we considered this a lower limit of ambient noise.
Exposure to railway noise was calculated with the joint Nordic
prediction method for railway noise based on general information
about rail traffic in 1993–2000. Screening by designated noise
screens and buildings was not considered. The noise impact from
airports and airfields was determined from information about
noise zones (5 dB categories) obtained from local authorities. The
curves for railway and aircraft noise were transformed into digital
maps and linked to each address by geocodes.
The concentration of NOx in the air was calculated with the
Danish AirGIS modelling system for each year (1988–2006) at
each address at which the cohort members had lived. AirGIS
allows calculation of air pollution at a location as the sum of: local
air pollution from traffic in the streets, with the Operational Street
Pollution Model; the urban background contribution, calculated
with a area source dispersion model; and a regional background
contribution [19]. Input data for the AirGIS system included
traffic data for individual road links for the period 1988–2005,
emission factors for the Danish car fleet, street and building
geometry, building height and meteorological data [20]. The
AirGIS system has been successfully validated and applied in
several studies [21–23]. We focused on the concentration of NOx
as indicator for air pollution from traffic because measured NOx
correlates strongly with other traffic-related pollutants in Danish
streets: r = 0.93 for total particle number concentration (10–
700 nm) and r = 0.70 for PM10 [24,25].
Statistical methods
The analyses were based on a Cox proportional hazards model
with age as the underlying time [26]. This ensured comparison of
individuals of the same age. We used left truncation at age of
enrolment, so that people were considered at risk from enrolment
into the cohort, and right censoring at the age of MI (event), death,
emigration or end of follow-up (27 June 2006), whichever came
first. Exposure to road traffic noise and NOx were modelled as
time-weighted averages the preceding 5-years (taking all present
and historical addresses in that period into account) at a given age
or as the yearly exposure at the residence at a given age. These
Traffic Noise and Myocardial Infarction

June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39283exposures (1- and 5-years) were entered as time-dependent
variables into the statistical risk model, thus for each incident
MI recalculating exposure for all cohort members at exactly the
same age as the case and at risk at the time of the MI.
The incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for MI in association with road
traffic noise were calculated for 1) yearly road traffic noise at
diagnosis, and 2) time-weighted mean road traffic noise 5-year
preceding diagnosis. Estimates were calculated crude and adjusted
for a priori defined potential confounders: sex, baseline information
on smoking status (never, former, current), smoking intensity (1–
14, 15–24 and $25 g tobacco/day), smoking duration (years),
intake of fruit (g/day), intake of vegetables (g/day), education (, 8,
8–10, .10 years), alcohol intake (g/day), body mass index (BMI,
,18, 18–25, 26–30$30 kg/m2) and physically active (not active,
#3.5,.3.5 h/week), information on calendar year, and informa-
tion on covariates based on address specific information: railway
and airport noise (mainly based on data from the late 1990’ies
(railway noise . 60 dB (yes/no) and airport noise . 60 dB (yes/
no)); and on air pollution (NOx, mg/m3, data on exposure at the
residence in the period from 1988–2006, calculated as 1) yearly
mean at the residential address of diagnosis, and 2) 5-year time-
weighted mean preceding diagnosis, such that in each analysis the
exposure calculation for NOx are similar to the exposure
calculation for road traffic noise). In a third model we further
adjusted for baseline measured diastolic and systolic blood
pressure (mm Hg), measured total cholesterol (mmol/L) and self-
reported diabetes. Traffic noise, air pollution, smoking duration,
intake of fruits and vegetables, systolic and diastolic blood pressure
and total cholesterol were entered as linear variables. Intake of
alcohol was included as a spline with a cut-point at 3 g/day. The
potential modifiers of an effect between road traffic noise and MI
by a priori selected baseline confounders and railway noise were
evaluated by introducing interaction terms into the model and
tested by the Wald test.
The procedure PHREG in SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina, USA) was used for the statistical analyses.
The exposure-response curve (Figure 1) was estimated and
visualized using restricted cubic splines (library Survival and library
Design) in R statistical software 2.9.0.
Results
Among the 57 053 cohort members, 566 were excluded due to
cancer before enrolment and 900 because they had a known
endpoint diagnosis (coronary artery disease) at enrolment. Among
the remaining 55 587 participants, a complete residential address
history between January 1988 and event or censoring date was
collected for 52 810 participants. Of these we excluded 2196
participants due to missing data on one or more co-variates
leaving a study population of 50 614 participants, including 1600
cases of incident MI. Average follow-up was 9.8 years.
The distribution of road traffic noise exposure (Lden) is shown in
Figure 1. Lden at the enrolment address and the time-weighted 5-
year mean Lden preceding enrolment (taking historical addresses
into account) was strongly positively correlated (RSpearman = 0.96,
p,0.0001). Also, there was a significant positive correlation
between Lden and NOx in the study period (RSpearman = 0.62,
p,0.0001). During the period from 1988 to end of follow-up in
2006 there was a small but steady increase over time in Lden for the
addresses used in this study (0.5 dB increase per 5 years). For NOx,
the concentration decreased approximately 35% from 1988 to
2000 after which it stabilised.
Cases had higher BMI and lower education, smoked more,
drank more alcohol, ate less fruit and vegetables, were less
physically active, had higher blood pressure and total cholesterol,
had higher prevalence of diabetes and were exposed to more
traffic noise and air pollution as compared to the whole cohort
(Table 1). Participants living at residences with more than 60 dB
from road traffic noise at baseline had higher BMI and lower
education, smoked more, ate less fruit and vegetables, were less
physically active and had higher prevalence of diabetes compared
to participants living with less than 60 dB (Table 1).
A 10-dB higher level of road traffic noise was associated with a
statistically significant 12 % higher risk for MI after adjustment for
various risk factors including exposure to NOx for both exposure
windows (diagnosis and 5-years preceding diagnosis; Table 2),
showing a linear dose-response relationship throughout the
exposure range of this study (42–84 dB, Figure 1). Adjustment
by NOx only resulted in small changes in estimates: 1.10 (95% CI:
1.03–1.19) before and 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02–1.22) after adjustment
for NOx per 10 dB higher Lden at diagnosis. There were no
significant associations between exposure to NOx at diagnosis or 5-
years preceding diagnosis and MI, though the results indicated
positive trends. The association between road traffic noise and MI
was still present after further adjustment for measured blood
pressure and cholesterol and self-reported diabetes (Table 2). We
found no significant effect modification, though there were
indications of a stronger association with road traffic noise among
participants above 65 years and among never smokers (Table 3).
Among the 331 cases with a fatal MI, the IRR per 10 dB yearly
road traffic noise at the residential address at diagnosis was 1.25
(95% CI: 1.07–1.46) in the crude analysis and 1.17 (95% CI: 0.96–
1.43) in the fully adjusted analysis.

Traffic Noise and Myocardial Infarction
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org

June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39283Discussion
In this study residential exposure to road traffic noise was
associated with a 12% higher risk for incident MI per 10 dB higher
exposure to noise showing a clear dose-response relationship.
A case-control study has previously investigated effect of long-
term road traffic noise during a period of more than 20 years on
risk of having a MI after adjustment for air pollution, assessed as
modelled NO2 [9]. They found that exposure to road traffic noise
of 50 dB or more resulted in a 12% (95% CI: 25% to 33%) higher
risk for MI, which is similar to the present study. Unlike the
present study, they found only a weak suggestion of a dose-
response relationship. However, after excluding persons with
hearing loss and exposure to noise from other sources they found
that noise exposure of 50 or more dB was associated with a 38%
(95% CI: 11% – 71%) higher risk for MI, with a significant linear
trend over noise categories. Especially exclusion of persons
exposed to railway noise seemed to result in higher estimates
[9], which is unlike the present study with similar risks among
persons exposed to over and under 60 dB of railway noise.
In a cohort study by Beelen et al. the joint effect of road traffic
noise and air pollution, assessed as black smoke and traffic
intensity, on mortality from ischemic heart disease was investigat-
ed [12]. They found a tendency of a weak association only in the
highest exposure category (.65 dB), which disappeared after
adjustment for air pollution. These findings are in contrast to the
previous [9] and the present study which both found that road
traffic noise increased the risk for fatal MI, with slightly higher risk
estimates for fatal MI as compared with all MI. A possible
explanation is that the previous [9] and the present study focused
on ‘acute MI’ (ICD10: I20) whereas the study by Beelen et al. had
a more broad case definition, covering e.g. heart aneurysms
(ICD10: I20-I25). Therefore, it seems possible that road traffic
noise mainly have an effect on incident MI. Also, Beelen et al.
used baseline addresses to model exposure whereas both Selander
et al. and the present study used historical address history. Finally,
Beelen et al. adjusted not only for air pollution (black smoke) but
also for traffic intensity which is a major determinant of the noise
level. This could have resulted in over-adjustment of the noise
effect. In contrast, the present study and Selander et al. adjusted
for NOx and NO2, respectively, both modelled using dispersion
models that calculate air pollution as the sum of local, urban
background and regional background contributions [19], and both
with a moderate R2 between road traffic noise and indicator of air
pollution on around 0.36. In the present study adjustment for NOx
only caused small changes in the estimates suggesting an
independent effect of road traffic noise on MI.
Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes are estab-
lished risk factors for MI but also outcomes suspected to be
associated with exposure to traffic noise [27], and therefore
possibly on the biological pathway between exposure to traffic
noise and a MI. In the present study, adjustment for measured
blood pressure, measured total cholesterol and self-reported
diabetes
only
resulted
in
minor
attenuations
in
estimates,
indicating that other pathways are involved in the effect of traffic
noise on risk for MI.
Some studies have similar to the present study indicated that the
effect of traffic noise (road and aircraft) on cardiovascular disease
are strongest among men [28–30], whereas others have indicated
no sex differences [9,10,12]. Also with regard to effect modifica-
tion by age the results are inconclusive, as similar to the present
study strongest effects of traffic noise have been found among the
oldest participants in relation to stroke [10] and MI [29], whereas
other studies indicated no effect modification by age in relation to
MI [9] and cardiovascular mortality [12]. Sleep disturbances can
contribute to cardiovascular risk [31,32], leading to the hypothesis
that exposure to noise during night might be more harmful than
daytime exposure. The sleep structure generally becomes more
fragmented with age, and elderly people are thus more susceptible
to sleep disturbances [33,34].
Stress and sleep disturbances can cause changes lifestyle habits,
including increased tobacco smoking, and thus potentially a
stronger association between traffic noise and MI among smokers.
However, we found indications of a high effect of road traffic noise
on MI among never smokers, with no clear pattern with regard to
smoking status. Other similar studies are inconclusive as one study
indicated effect of road traffic noise on MI only among former
smokers [9], whereas no effect modification by smoking was found
for road traffic noise on cardiovascular mortality [12].
Both short- and long-term exposure to traffic noise may affect
the risk for MI. Risk factors for development of arthrosclerosis
include hypertension, inflammation and glucose intolerance,
which have all been associated with traffic noise, stress and/or
sleep disturbances [27,35–37]. On the other hand, inflammation
and high blood pressure may also have more acute effects,
including effect on plaque rupture. We investigated effects of both
relatively recent exposure, namely yearly noise, and longer term
exposure, namely 5-year noise. The results were virtually identical,
probably due to that only 28% moved during follow-up causing a
strong correlation between recent and more distant exposure. It is
therefore impossible for us to separate the effect of recent and
distant noise exposure in relation to MI.

Traffic Noise and Myocardial Infarction
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org
5
June 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 6 | e39283The strengths of our study include the prospective design, the
large number of cases, the strict validation of the diagnosis of MI
using nationwide registers and review of medical records, and
access to residential address histories. Furthermore, we considered
only the first hospitalization for MI, reducing any influence of
preventive medication on the risk estimates. Another strength is
adjustment for air pollution, which is known to correlate with road
traffic noise and, thus, could confound the association between
noise and MI. We used NOx levels as an indicator of air pollution,
because NOx is a good marker of traffic-related air pollution and
correlates closely with particulate matter, both ultrafine particles
and PM10 [25]. Long-term exposures to air pollution has been
associated with risk of ischemic heart disease, strongest for fatal
events [11]. We found that exposure to road traffic noise was
significantly associated with risk for MI both before and after
adjustment by air pollution, suggesting an independent effect of
road traffic noise.
Some limitations also need to be considered. Our study is not
representative of the Danish population as the study population
lived mainly in urban areas. Also, death from other causes that MI
results in censoring, which excludes participants dying from other
cardiovascular disease associated with traffic noise such as stroke,
and potentially with high risk of MI if they had survived. This
could have underestimated the true association. The estimation of
noise was based on modelled values. Although the Nordic
prediction method has been used for many years, estimation of
noise is inevitably associated with some degree of uncertainty. One
reason could be inaccurate input data, which would result in
exposure misclassification. As the noise model does not distinguish
between cases and the cohort, such misclassification is believed to
be non-differential, and, in most situations, this would influence
the relative risk estimate towards the neutral value. Also, we had
information only on residential addresses. Such an imprecision is,
however, believed to have been similar for cases and cohort and
might therefore have attenuated the estimates. We also had no
information on bedroom location, noise from neighbours and
ventilation or hearing impairment, all of which might influence
exposure to noise. The study by Selander et al. investigating effects
of road traffic noise on incident MI found that the association with
road traffic noise was stronger when several of these factors were
considered [9], suggesting that the effect of noise might be
underestimated in the present study. Finally, there might be
residual confounding from risk factors not accounted for in the
analyses, such as familiar history of MI. However, adjustment of
our analyses resulted in only minor changes in the estimates
although we adjusted for many important risk factors for MI, and,
therefore, residual confounding seems not to be a major issue in
the present study.
In conclusion, the present study shows a positive association
between residential exposure to road traffic noise and risk for MI
in a general Danish population, with a clear dose-response
relationship.
