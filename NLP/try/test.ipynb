      "Stubble burning has been reckoned among the major contributors of air pollution especially in South Asia. It is \n",
      "a signiﬁcant source of gaseous pollutants such as, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides \n",
      "(NO x ), sulfur oxides (SO x ), and methane (CH 4 ) as well as particulate matters (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) causing serious \n",
      "damage to human health and the environment. It was reported that the burning of 63 Mt of crop stubble releases \n",
      "3.4 Mt of CO, 0.1 Mt of NO x , 91 Mt of CO 2 , 0.6 Mt of CH 4 and 1.2 Mt of PM into the atmosphere. The situation is \n",
      "more austere in India due to the intensive rice-wheat rotation system which generates large amount of stubble. \n",
      "It was estimated that about 352 Mt of stubble is generated each year in India out of which 22% and 34% are \n",
      "contributed by wheat and rice stubble respectively. About 84 Mt (23.86%) of the stubble is burnt on-ﬁeld each \n",
      "year immediately after harvest. The disastrous haze observed over India during the winter season has been linked \n",
      "to stubble burning as it coincides with the burning periods (October-November). During this time, most Indian \n",
      "cities, especially within the National Capital Region (NCR) experience harsh pollution often reaching the severe \n",
      "levels of the air quality index (AQI). In November 2019, Delhi recorded a peak AQI of 487, Ghaziabad reported \n",
      "an AQI as high as 493, and Greater Noida recorded 480. The health eﬀects of air pollution ranges from skin \n",
      "and eyes irritation to severe neurological, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive \n",
      "pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, lung capacity loss, emphysema, cancer, etc. It also leads to an increase \n",
      "in mortality rates due to the prolonged exposure to high pollution. The Energy and Resources Institute (2019) \n",
      "reported that in 2012, air pollution had led to about 5 million deaths in South Asia which is around 22% of \n",
      "the total deaths in the region. In addition to its eﬀects on air quality, stubble burning also aﬀects soil fertility \n",
      "(through the destruction of its nutrients), economic development and climate. The crop stubbles (if managed \n",
      "properly) could provide immense economic beneﬁts to the farmers and protect the environment from the severe \n",
      "pollution. Some of the alternative management practices include the incorporation of the stubble into the soil, \n",
      "use of stubble as fuel in power plants, use as raw material for pulp and paper industries, or as biomass for biofuel \n",
      "production. It can also be used to generate compost and biochar, or as blend for the production of cement and \n",
      "bricks. Most of the farmers in North India are not aware of the proliﬁc alternatives for managing stubble and, \n",
      "therefore, consider burning as the best option. This necessitates the need for immense awareness programs to \n",

      "1. Introduction \n",
      "Stubble burning is one of the major contributors to atmospheric pol- \n",
      "lution in the world releasing particulate and gaseous pollutants that \n",
      "have severe eﬀects on human health and the environment ( Sharma et al., \n",
      "2010 ). It is a signiﬁcant source of air pollution in many parts of the world \n",
      "being only the 3 rd after industrial and vehicular emissions ( Gurjar et al., \n",
      "2016 ; Krishna et al., 2011 ). Stubble burning can be deﬁned as the in- \n",
      "tentional incineration of stubbles by farmers after crop harvest. Stub- \n",
      "bles are the cut stalks left on the ﬁeld after the grains of cereal plants or \n",
      "stems of sugarcane are harvested. Other biomass burning activities such \n",
      "as wood burning for domestic cooking, open ﬁeld incineration of mu- \n",
      "nicipal waste, and wildﬁre also contribute to the emissions, however; in \n",
      "Asian countries such as China, around 60% of the total biomass emis- \n",
      "sions comes from the burning of stubble ( Zhang et al., 2015 ). On a global \n",
      "scale, stubble burning constitutes about one-fourth of the total biomass \n",
      "burning (inclusive of forest ﬁres) ( Yadav and Devi, 2019 ; Zhang et al., \n",
      "2016 ). \n",
      "The harsh haze observed over South Asia during the winter season \n",
      "has been linked to biomass burning as it coincides with the stubble burn- \n",
      "ing periods ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ; Khwaja et al., 2012 ). In India, New Delhi \n",
      "and the other NCR (National Capital Region) cities have been experi- \n",
      "encing harsh pollution from smog and haze caused by various anthro- \n",
      "pogenic activities and lower temperatures during the winter especially \n",
      "during October to December months every year. Since 1990, Delhi has \n",
      "been listed among the most polluted cities in the world. Recently, in \n",
      "2019, the global air quality report showed that 14 out of the 20 most \n",
      "polluted cities in the world are from India with the most polluted being \n",
      "the city of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh (U.P) ( Sikarwar and Rani, 2020 ). \n",
      "Greater Noida and Delhi were ranked the 5 th and 9 th on the list. Most \n",
      "of the cities on the list fall under the Northern region of India especially \n",
      "the state of Uttar Pradesh ( Sikarwar and Rani, 2020 ). \n",
      "The common farming system in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is \n",
      "the rice-wheat rotation system. The IGP is an important region located \n",
      "in South Asia blessed with fertile agricultural farmlands and a diverse \n",
      "ecosystem. Geographically, it occupies about 20% of the total land area \n",
      "of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. In India, it consists of about \n",
      "40% of the country’s total population occupying around 20% of its total \n",
      "geographical area. This region provides 41% of the annual food produc- \n",
      "tion in India most of which are grains. Out of approximately 66 million \n",
      "hectares (total area of the IGP), about 12 million hectares are utilized for \n",
      "the wheat-rice (Crop rotation) production system ( Sharma et al., 2010 ). \n",
      "An estimated 9.6 million hectares of land are utilized annually for the \n",
      "rice-wheat cropping system in India ( Sharma et al., 2010 ). Most of the \n",
      "farmers in this region use combine harvesters for planting and harvest- \n",
      "ing the crops thereby generating a signiﬁcant quantity of stubble. The \n",
      "use of Combine harvesters for harvesting grains is common among In- \n",
      "dian farmers especially in the northern parts of the country. This ma- \n",
      "chine can combine three diﬀerent tasks, i.e. Reaping, Threshing, and \n",
      "Winnowing into a single operation. They are reported to be eﬃcient \n",
      "in harvesting diﬀerent types of grains, however; they generate a huge \n",
      "amount of stubble consisting of tall stalks, about 15cm high, which are \n",
      "diﬃcult to be incorporated into the soil ( Mittal et al., 2009 ; Pratika and \n",
      "Sandhu, 2020 ). \n",
      "A signiﬁcant amount of the stubble generated is set to ﬁre on the \n",
      "ﬁeld. According to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), ap- \n",
      "proximately 14 million tons (Mt) out of the 22 Mt of the rice stubble \n",
      "(about 63.6%) generated each year in India is set to ﬁre ( IARI, 2012 ). \n",
      "Haryana and Punjab, two of the key agricultural states of India, alone \n",
      "contribute 48% to this amount ( Gadde et al., 2009 ). In the Punjab re- \n",
      "gion, rice and wheat account for about 85.91% of the total cultivation \n",
      "with other crops produced in relatively minor quantities. Rice is usually \n",
      "planted in the summer season, around May/June, and harvested around \n",
      "October/November. On the other hand, wheat is normally planted dur- \n",
      "ing the winter, mostly in December and harvested during the summer \n",
      "of the subsequent year, around April/May. The burning takes place im- \n",
      "mediately after harvest in each season. This time may, however, vary in \n",
      "other parts of the world ( Kapil, 2019 ). \n",
      "From the farmers’ perspective, it is easier to burn the crop stubble \n",
      "after harvest to quickly prepare the farmland for the next sowing (of \n",
      "rice or wheat as the case may be). The farmers’ eagerness to quickly \n",
      "prepare the farmland for the next planting compels them to simply burn \n",
      "the stubble on-ﬁeld thereby emitting a large number of hazardous pol- \n",
      "lutants ( Krishna et al., 2011 ). Another rationale behind the burning of \n",
      "the stubble is the shortage of time between the harvest and the sowing \n",
      "of the next crop ( Ravindra et al., 2018 ). The average time interval be- \n",
      "tween the harvest of rice and sowing of wheat was reported to be 15 \n",
      "days, and that of rice sowing after wheat harvest was relatively higher, \n",
      "up to about 46-48 days. The farmers, therefore, do not have suﬃcient \n",
      "time to appropriately manage the crop stubble especially after rice har- \n",
      "vest ( Krishna et al., 2011 ). \n",
      "Burning of ﬁrecrackers during Diwali, a major festival in India, was \n",
      "suggested by some ( Arora et al., 2018 ) as the cause of poor winter air \n",
      "in India. For example, in 2019, Delhi, Noida, Gurugaram, and Ghazi- \n",
      "abad reached the hazardous AQI levels during the Diwali festival. Di- \n",
      "wali is, however, not the major cause of air quality problems during \n",
      "the winter due to the presence of harsh pollution even before the event \n",
      "( Barman et al., 2008 ; Ghei and Sane, 2018 ). The Diwali activities coin- \n",
      "cide with the crop stubble burning periods and thus results in further \n",
      "deterioration of the air quality. Ghei and Sane (2018) reported that the \n",
      "burning of ﬁrecrackers during the Diwali ceremony results in a quanti- \n",
      "tatively small and statistically signiﬁcant rise in air pollution. They com- \n",
      "pared the stubble burning periods with and without Diwali and found an \n",
      "increase of about 40 μg/m 3 PM 2.5 (Particulate matter with aerodynamic \n",
      "diameter less than 2.5 microns) concentration during Diwali days in \n",
      "2018. \n",
      "It is worth noting that stubble burning is not the only cause of post- \n",
      "monsoon deteriorated air across the IGP; meteorological conditions such \n",
      "as ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction \n",
      "and ambient pressure also play important roles ( Ravindra et al., 2019 ). \n",
      "A number of studies have established a link between the post-monsoon \n",
      "poor quality of air in India and the variation in meteorological condi- \n",
      "tions ( Banerjee et al., 2011 ; Guttikunda & Gurjar, 2012 ; Krishan et al., \n",
      "2019 ; Resmi et al., 2020 ). Sembhi et al. (2020) asserted that the vari- \n",
      "ations in PM 2.5 concentrations is dependent upon speciﬁc meteorolog- \n",
      "ical parameters. In other words, the post-monsoon meteorological con- \n",
      "ditions favor more stable atmosphere rendering the pollutants to accu- \n",
      "mulate and reside longer in the atmosphere leading to severe levels of \n",
      "pollution. \n",
      "The impact of stubble burning is more severe during the rice stubble \n",
      "burning season as the lower winter temperature leads to a more stable \n",
      "atmosphere (Inversion conditions) ( Ghei and Sane, 2018 ). The fact that \n",
      "pollutants stay longer in the atmosphere during this time, and that the \n",
      "amount of rice stubble burned is quite higher than that of wheat results \n",
      "in a harsh level of pollution often obstructing visibility. It was reported \n",
      "that the air pollution level in Delhi during October 2017 was six-fold \n",
      "as compared to that during July of the same year . The atmospheric in- \n",
      "version provides greater residing time for pollutants, poorer dispersion, \n",
      "and lesser rate of smoke diﬀusion. The smoke generated, therefore, ac- \n",
      "cumulates in the atmosphere exerting more damage to the environment \n",
      "( Pratika and Sandhu, 2020 ). \n",
      "Air pollution poses a grave threat to human health and wellbeing \n",
      "leading to a rise in mortality and morbidity rates in many parts of the \n",
      "world. According to WHO, toxic air, as a result of pollution, results in \n",
      "the death of about 7 million people in the world annually ( WHO 2008 ). \n",
      "The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) reported that in 2012, air pol- \n",
      "lution had led to about 5 million deaths in South Asia which is around \n",
      "22% of the total deaths in the region. The report added that more than \n",
      "51% of the total population in South Asia has been under continuous \n",
      "exposure to PM 2.5 above the WHO limits ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ). India con- \n",
      "tributes 26.2% to the total global Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) \n",
      "rate while constituting only 18% of the world population. The northernM.I. Abdurrahman, S. Chaki and G. Saini \n",
      "Environmental Advances 2 (2020) 100011 \n",
      "region of the country has the highest rate of DALY especially in the U.P, \n",
      "Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ). \n",
      "Air pollution also aﬀects economic development both on the local \n",
      "and regional scale. It claims approximately 5 trillion dollars from the \n",
      "global economy annually ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ). The poor visibility in the \n",
      "NCR as a result of air pollution has caused many people to migrate out of \n",
      "the region especially during severe pollution episodes which conversely \n",
      "aﬀects tourism, especially in Delhi. A survey on tourism, in 2018, re- \n",
      "ported that the inﬂow of tourists into Delhi has decreased by about 25- \n",
      "30 % as a result of air pollution ( Sharma et al., 2019 ). Air pollution, \n",
      "therefore, has a great impact on tourism and economic development. \n",
      "The states most aﬀected by the severe pollution are Delhi, Uttar \n",
      "Pradesh (U.P), Punjab, Haryana, Bihar, and West Bengal. These states \n",
      "are also the most agriculturally productive in India ( Khrishna et al., \n",
      "2011 ). Punjab, for example, is sometimes regarded as the country’s \n",
      "breadbasket and provides about 30% of the country’s grain supply \n",
      "( Saggu, 2018 ). Survey has shown that U.P has the highest number of \n",
      "farmers counting to about 23.8 million ( Sharma et al., 2010 ). \n",
      "The impact of stubble burning may increase in the coming years with \n",
      "the increase in population and food demand. A report by the United \n",
      "Nation pointed out that the world population may rise to 10 billion \n",
      "by 2050, which will in turn lead to increased food demand. In India, \n",
      "crop production is projected to increase by 45% by 2050, i.e. from 619 \n",
      "Mt (million tons) in 2017 to 899 Mt in 2050 ( United Nations, 2015 ). \n",
      "This will necessitate the production of more food and consequently the \n",
      "generation and burning of more stubble. \n",
      "Several eﬀorts have been made by the government to provide al- \n",
      "ternative management techniques for the farmers to manage their crop \n",
      "stubble. Despite strict policies, the practice of outdoor crop stubble burn- \n",
      "ing in India continues to be a threat to human health and wellbeing. \n",
      "However, in 2018, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate \n",
      "Change (MoEF&CC), Government of India, reported a reduction in the \n",
      "number of stubble ﬁres in Haryana and Punjab by about 38.93% and \n",
      "20.3% respectively as compared to 2016 ( Singh, 2018 ). \n",
      "This review aims to comprehensively cover the existing literature \n",
      "and current status of stubble burning in India, including; (1) the gen- \n",
      "eration and burning of crop stubble (2) the composition of emissions \n",
      "from stubble burning (3) the transport and dispersion of emissions from \n",
      "stubble burning (4) the eﬀects of stubble burning (5) the legislation and \n",
      "policies on stubble burning and (6) the alternative techniques for man- \n",
      "aging crop stubbles. The review also recommends some approaches that \n",
      "(if used appropriately) will profoundly assist in arresting the issues of \n",
      "burning agricultural stubble in the country and beyond. \n",
      "2. Crop stubble generation and burning \n",
      "A huge amount of waste is generated after harvesting crops like \n",
      "wheat and rice, most of which are burned after the valuable constituents \n",
      "have been removed. Some of these wastes are used as animal feeds, for \n",
      "making cattle sheds, rural houses roofs, or as fuel for domestic cooking. \n",
      "In rare cases, they serve as raw materials for small scale industries, such \n",
      "as pulp/board industries, biogas generation, etc ( Ravindra et al., 2018 , \n",
      "Singh et al., 2016 ). Nonetheless, a signiﬁcant portion of the stubble is \n",
      "left on the ﬁeld with no speciﬁc usability, and therefore it is simply \n",
      "burned to clear the farm for next planting ( Singh et al., 2018 ). About \n",
      "352 Mt of agricultural stubble are generated each year by cereal crops \n",
      "out of which 22% and 34% are contributed by wheat and rice stub- \n",
      "bles respectively ( Singh et al., 2018 ). Uttar Pradesh generates the high- \n",
      "est quantity of stubble, about 72Mt, followed by Punjab (46Mt), West \n",
      "Bengal (37.3Mt), Andhra Pradesh (33Mt), and then Haryana (24Mt) \n",
      "( IARI, 2012 ). These values may increase in the future with increased \n",
      "population and food demand. There is also a potential likelihood of their \n",
      "reduction with the development of technological methods and machin- \n",
      "ery for managing agricultural stubble and/or governmental policies. The \n",

      "Kumar et al. (2015) conducted a source apportionment study in Pa- \n",
      "tiala city and discovered that stubble burning contributes about 100-200 \n",
      "μg/m 3 of PM 10 to the air pollution of the city. \n",
      "Despite not being the main source of pollution, stubble burning is a \n",
      "signiﬁcant source of air pollution in India. A combination of point and \n",
      "nonpoint sources constitute the composite emissions. These sources in- \n",
      "clude; industries, power plants, vehicles, construction, and indoor emis- \n",
      "sions ( Sharma and Dhiskit, 2016 ). Guttikunda and Gurjar (2012) found \n",
      "that emissions from industrial sources comprise 15% of CO, 14% of \n",
      "PM 2.5 and 23% of SO 2 , while transportation emissions contain 17% of \n",

      "across the north Indian states ( ﬁgure 1 ) ( Mishra, 2019 ). The air quality \n",

      "of the presence of the accumulated pollutants from vehicular and indus- \n",
      "trial emissions leading to a severe air quality conditions ( Mishra, 2019 ). \n",
      "The air quality of a region can be categorized in terms of a param- \n",

      "gorical measurements of the pollution level which helps in interpreting \n",
      "the quality of air in a region on a scale of 0-500 ( Table 3 ) ( Central Pol- \n",
      "lution Control Board, 2014 ). Most of the regions in North India have \n",
      "AQI beyond the safe limit, especially during the burning episodes. For \n",

      "5.2. Eﬀects on soil fertility \n",
      "Apart from the eﬀects on air quality, stubble burning also aﬀects \n",
      "soil productivity by burning the essential nutrients inside the soil \n",
      "( Singh et al., 2018 ). It also raises the soil temperature to about 42 °C, \n",
      "thus displacing or killing the important microorganisms in the soil at a \n",
      "depth of about 2.5 cm ( Jain et al., 2014 ). This generates an additional \n",
      "expense of regaining back the soil fertility through the application of \n",
      "fertilizer or compost. Stubble burning strips the soil of the essential nu- \n",
      "trients, i.e. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK) as well as other \n",
      "micro-nutrients. For instance, the burning of rice stubble leads to a loss \n",
      "of about 0.445 Mt of NPK, 0.144 Mt in the case of wheat stubble burning,M.I. Abdurrahman, S. Chaki and G. Saini \n",

      "The eﬀects of burning crop stubble extend to the agricultural sec- \n",
      "tor. There is convincing empirical evidence that air pollution aﬀects \n",
      "food production. The pollutants may aﬀect agricultural productivity di- \n",
      "rectly or indirectly. Direct eﬀects entail injury to leaves, grains, or as- \n",
      "similation of heavy metals. For example, Nitrogen oxide can damage \n",
      "the tissue of plants and cause discoloration. SO 2 may lead to the for- \n",
      "mation of acid rain which has severe eﬀects on plants and soil, and \n",
      "may lead to plant mortality ( Augustaitis et al., 2010 ). Prolonged expo- \n",
      "sure of plants to particulates pollution may lead to Chlorosis or Bifacial \n",
      "Necrosis ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ). Indirect eﬀects include the provision of \n",
      "favorable conditions for the growth of pests or diseases. For example, \n",
      "the growth of aphid pests is favored by high concentrations of SO 2 and \n",
      "NO 2 ( Ghosh et al., 2019 ). \n",
      "Stubble burning releases VOCs and NO x which combine to form \n",
      "ground-level ozone. Ozone is formed in the immediate atmosphere \n",
      "by the reaction of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds \n",
      "in the presence of solar radiation. Ground-level ozone aﬀects plant’s \n",
      "metabolism, penetrates, and destroys leaves causing serious eﬀects on \n",
      "crops in the northern parts of India. Ozone was reported to greatly aﬀect \n",
      "the performance of some crops such as wheat and soy, while crops like \n",
      "barley were known to possess some resistance to the same. Rice and \n",
      "maize were reported to be moderately aﬀected ( Sharma et al., 2019 ). \n",
      "Hence, stubble burning negatively impacts agricultural productivity and \n",
      "needs to be dealt with appropriately to improve agricultural production \n",

      "5.4. Mortality rates \n",
      "The rates of death as a result of air pollution have been gradually \n",
      "increasing over recent years. For example, in South Asia, the number \n",

      "integrating modern mass media techniques. \n",
      "• Furthermore, the pulp and paper, construction, biomass, and power \n",
      "industries should be compelled by the government to use the crop \n",
      "stubble as a proportion of their raw materials. This will provide mo- \n",
      "tivation to the farmers as selling the stubble will generate additional \n",
      "income for them. \n",
      "• Diﬀerent pollutants may behave distinctly under a unique condition, \n",
      "and a single pollutant may behave diﬀerently under various con- \n",
      "ditions. The development of the appropriate strategy to eﬀectively \n",
      "control air pollution requires a profound understanding of the chem- \n",
      "ical and physical processes governing the transport, deposition, and \n",
      "dispersion of the pollutants. This brings forth the applicability of air \n",
      "pollution models to simulate the pollutants’ behavior under distinct \n",

      "sive models to be used for more accurate and reliable air pollution \n",
      "simulations. \n",
      "• To eﬃciently control trans-boundary transport of air pollutants, \n",
      "there is a need for collaboration and eﬀective communication be- \n",
      "tween the national governments of the neighboring countries. Inter- \n",
      "national committees should, therefore, be formed comprising mem- \n",
      "bers from the concerned countries to discuss and tackle any interna- \n",
      "tional air pollution issues that may arise. \n",
      "• Even though air quality control programs have been more success- \n",
      "ful in India compared to other south Asian countries, there is still \n",
      "a need for eﬀective enforcement of policies to ensure appropriate \n",
      "compliance among the intended populace. \n",
      "• There is also a need to expand the NAMP because most of the rural \n",
      "areas (where stubble burning takes place) have not been assessed \n",
      "as most of the stations are situated in urban regions. Exposure to a \n",
      "high level of pollution in these areas proves fatal due to the non- \n",
      "availability of quality health care facilities. \n",
      "• Another challenge is the lack of enforcement on the existing rules \n",
      "rendering the policies ineﬀective in most places. This may be as- \n",
      "sociated with the lack of follow-up, insuﬃcient funding, and the \n",
      "non-availability of incentives. Eﬀective enforcement and follow-up \n",
      "should be exhibited by government agencies to ensure intended com- \n",
      "pliance. Incentives should also be provided to the farmers that adopt \n",
      "sustainable management practices at all levels. \n",
      "• The lack of collaboration among various institutions involved in the \n",
      "control of air pollution within the country and beyond contributes \n",
      "to the non-attainment of success in the ﬁght against pollution. There \n",
      "is a need to facilitate communication, cooperation, and partnership \n",
      "among national leaders and decision-makers, and to promote the ex- \n",

      "Conclusion \n",
      "The large-scale rice-wheat crop rotation system practiced in India \n",
      "has resulted in the generation of signiﬁcant quantity of crop stubble of- \n",
      "ten more than the quantity of grains harvested. A considerable portion \n",
      "of these stubbles is usually burnt on-ﬁeld to clear the farm for the next \n",
      "planting, thus releasing toxic pollutants to the atmosphere which leads \n",
      "to the deterioration of air quality. It may be concluded (based on the ex- \n",
      "isting evidence) that the combined eﬀects of stubble burning emissions \n",
      "and meteorological conditions are the cause of the severity of air quality \n",
      "especially during rice stubble burning episodes in north Indian cities. \n",
      "The pollutants from stubble burning pose a grave risk to the health \n",
      "of the exposed population as they are linked to several health issues \n",
      "and even death, in severe cases. In addition to atmospheric pollution, \n",
      "stubble burning may also lead to climate change, global warming, and \n",
      "the destruction of soil nutrients. It is, therefore, the need of the hour to \n",
      "implement exhaustive policies to curb this menace at its base. \n",
      "In contrast to burning, the stubbles can be exploited to yield econom- \n",
      "ically valuable and environmentally friendly substances such as compost \n",
      "or biochar. They can also be used as fuel in power plants, as biomass \n",
      "for biofuel production, as blends for cement/brick production, or as raw \n",
      "materials for the production of pulp and paper. Most of the farmers in \n",
      "North India are not aware of these proliﬁc alternatives and, therefore, \n",
