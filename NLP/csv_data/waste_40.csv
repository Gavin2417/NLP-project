"Open municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion is a major emission source of particulate air pollution, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and more exotic hazardous organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls and brominated flame retar-
dants. However, the adverse impact of MSW combustion emission on health among the general population is unknown.
Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the associations between potential exposure to MSW combustion-
related air pollution and symptoms of adverse health effects among residents of a community adjacent to a large open landfill in
Lagos, Nigeria. Using ordinal logistic regression and controlling for age, sex, and smoking, it was observed that residence for ≥
11 years had increased odds (p < 0.05) of daily occurrence of tingling/numbness/whiteness of fingers (2.614), headaches (2.725),
memory problems (2.869), tremor/cramps (2.748), and confusion (3.033) among other symptoms. These results indicate adverse
health impacts of chronic exposure to MSW combustion emission.

"India, a highly populated economy in transition generates huge quantity of municipal solid wastes and its management is 
posing great challenges. Infrastructural limitations force the urban local bodies to rely on traditional routes such as open 
dumpyards and landfills, where incidents of massive fire breakouts are often reported. In places where the collection system 
fails, the public seeks a much easier option of open burning of wastes in streets and households. The study reports a com-
parative assessment of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dl-PCBs emitted to air and residue during the repetitive incidents of massive fire 
breakouts at a municipal solid waste dumpyard and localized street waste burning in cities of India. The study also evaluated 
the direct exposure routes viz. inhalation as well as dermal and predicts the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks 
to the receiving population. The observed PCDD/F levels in the ambient air and burned residue samples ranged from 2.7 to 
41.4 pgTEQ/m3 and 79.8 to 860 ngTEQ/kg, while that of dl-PCB varied from 0.2 to 2.3 pgTEQ/m3 and 6.0 to 46.2 ngTEQ/
kg respectively. The dermal, as well as the inhalation daily exposure doses were estimated and the non-carcinogenic hazard 
indices of the children were found to be in levels of concern at two of the street burning sites while for adults the levels were 
found to be within the threshold limit. The cumulative Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) values ranged from 2 × ­10–6 
to 2 × ­10–4 suggesting moderate to low risk to cancer or cancer-linked illnesses to exposed individuals.

The practice of household bush burning in Grenada occurs frequently, though it is not well documented. The effects of the
emissions from bush burning on respiratory health of the population have never been researched in Grenada. The goal of the
study was to measure the frequency of bush burning and to investigate the relationship between bush burning practice and
respiratory health in Grenada. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was used to gather information from households in
the parishes of St. George and St. Andrew, Grenada. In total, 225 participants were recruited and their responses on household
bush burning and respiratory symptoms were analyzed. Self-reported data showed that the practice of bush burning was
conducted by 43% (n = 96) of the participants as a regular practice (every month) and 86% (n = 192) of participants stated
that their neighbors burn bush regularly. The most common lower respiratory symptom associated with bush burning was dry
cough (31.4%). The participants who engage in the practice of bush burning had a statistically signiﬁcant, higher prevalence of
sinusitis symptoms (OR: 2.1, CI 95%: 1.1–3.9) and had slightly higher prevalence of cough (OR: 1.6, CI 95%: 0.9–2.8).
Prevalences of physician-diagnosed asthma and sinusitis were 12.3% and 31.2%, respectively. Conducting studies on the health
effects of bush burning in different settings and with different practices, such as the household bush burning in our current study,
could help to improve public health in the developing world.
Implications:
Household disposal of waste is a signiﬁcant issue in the developing world. In particular, residential bush
burning is a common practice in tropical regions. This study demonstrates that the common practice of bush burning in the
Caribbean is associated with respiratory symptoms and demonstrates the need for better management of residential yard waste.
Burning of yard waste results in potentially signiﬁcant exposures to air pollution and therefore alternative disposal practices need
to be available. There is a need to increase awareness of the importance of avoiding exposure to the air pollutants generated
during bush burning among communities in the Caribbean.
Introduction
Bush burning is a chemical process that involves the break-
down of plant material into ash and other organic matter. This
process is widely utilized in developing countries in an effort to
clear lands for cultivation and for removal of dry vegetation,
creating an open space that can be used for crops, and tends to
be more widespread in the tropics (Cançado et al., 2006). The
practice of bush burning plays a supporting role in contributing to
the problem of outdoor pollution in the environment. Smoke
particles emitted from this process contain small particles with
aerodynamic diameters that are generally signiﬁcantly less than
2.5 µm (Wardoyoa et al., 2007; Haywood et al., 2003). Speciﬁc
chemical and physical characteristics of these particles are sig-
niﬁcantly impacted by the particular conditions under which
burning occurs, which can be highly variable in wildﬁre and
agricultural burning (Wardoyoa et al., 2007; Hays et al., 2002).
The chemical constituents of this particulate matter are also
diverse and have been evaluated and found to include elemental
carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxalate, C31
n-alkane, levoglucosan, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC),
oleic acid, K, Zn, Cl, Na, NO3, V, Pb, Cr, Cd, and Na (Estrellan
and Iino, 2010; Lara et al., 2005). It has long been suspected that
plant-based material, through either combustion or other pro-
cesses, may serve as one source of ﬁne particle organics in the
atmosphere (Blando et al., 1998). A host of gases have also been
associated with burning of agricultural waste, including CO2,
CO, CH4, N2O, NOx, nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC)
(Estrellan and Iino, 2010; California Ofﬁce of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment, 2008), and volatile and semivolatile
organic compounds (Lemieux et al., 2004). The ﬁne particles
have been shown to penetrate deep into the lower respiratory
system through the lungs and to pose a threat to the health of

Environmental and Occupational Health, 1996). The identiﬁed
gases are also associated with adverse health endpoints, including
those listed as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) under the U.S.
Clean Air Act (EPA, 2014).
Household bush burning is a part of a more general practice
known as backyard burning or barrel burning. This process,
according to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA,
2013), refers to burning of household trash by residents at their
own property. This trash can include cardboard, plastics, yard
trimmings, paper and many other materials and is a very common
disposal method used in many developing countries (Solorzano-
Ochoa et al., 2012). The emissions from the combustion process
are freely released directly into the atmosphere without treatment
or ﬁltration to remove particulate matter. These emissions are also
highly variable, depending the conditions under which burning
takes place (Solorzano-Ochoa et al., 2012). The burning of waste
is harmful to both human health and the environment. According
to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2013), emis-
sions from this process can aggravate respiratory disease, such as
asthma, and can increase the risk of heart disease. The process can
also produce a group of highly toxic chemicals known as dioxins
(Lemieux et al., 2000), which can then settle on crops or deposit in
waterways and affect the health of those who would ingest con-
taminated crops or water.
Worldwide, 8% of noncommunicable disease mortalities are
made up by chronic respiratory disease, which is signiﬁcant
(World Health Organization [WHO], 2011b). The most common
among them are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), which account for 235 million and 50 million cases
worldwide, respectively (WHO, 2011a). Both of these diseases
are shown to be increasing worldwide, and asthma can be linked
to an estimated 250,000 deaths annually (WHO, 2007). According
to the World Health Organization (WHO), around the world,
hundreds of millions of persons suffer from chronic respiratory
diseases, many of which are preventable (WHO, 2007). A signiﬁ-
cant point to consider with these diseases is that indoor and outdoor
air pollution is a major risk factor in their development.
Bush burning can be carried out by a range of different
individuals, including regular homeowners, farmers, and busi-
nesses, as often as they deem necessary, with only an unen-
forced warning for reduction of the practice in the dry seasons
in Grenada. Statistics from the Fire Department Headquarters
of Grenada show that 478 major bush ﬁres alone were reported
in 2010, which were mainly due to the spread of unregulated
household bush ﬁres. The association between household bush
burning and its effect on respiratory health is a concern not
previously researched in Grenada or in the Caribbean. This
study aims to discover how prevalent the burning of bush is
by persons residing in Grenada, and to investigate the relation-
ship between bush burning practice and respiratory symptoms.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, trained personnel collected
information using a standardized questionnaire from house-
holds in the parishes of St. George, which is a nonrural area,
and St. Andrew, which is rural, in Grenada. Ethical approval
was obtained from the institutional review board of St.
George’s University in Grenada.
The sample population was chosen using the Grenada cen-
sus data by using multistage cluster sampling. The calculated
sample size, including household members 18 years and older,
was in total 281 participants from the parishes of St. George
(nonrural) and St. Andrew (rural), Grenada (conﬁdence interval
= 0.95, margin of error = 0.05, assumed proportion = 0.5). The
sample size calculation included an additional 15% reserve
population to address any plausible loss of sample population.
WHO recommended Kish methodology was used for the
household participant selection (Kish, 1995).
Respiratory health questions were developed based on exist-
ing validated standard questionnaires by the American Thoracic
Society, Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire (Ferris, 1978). The
questionnaire was pretested through a pilot study in a different
community in Grenada. The questionnaire included questions
on demographics, bush burning practice, airway symptoms,
physician-diagnosed diseases, environmental health-related his-
tory, and smoking status and was administered to participants
at their home. Data were collected on the upper and lower
respiratory symptoms suffered by the participants within the
last 12 months, as well as the symptoms they may have
experienced during or after their exposure to the smoke emis-
sions from the burning of bush. Questions about sinusitis
included symptoms such as drainage of a discharge, dry throat,
and pain or tenderness around face or forehead.
Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software
package version 18.0. Descriptive and analytical analyses were
done based on the type of data collected. Chi-squared and
unconditional logistic regression models were used to analyze
the data. In our preliminary analysis, we included sex, age, and
smoking in the model. However, we did not observe any
associations with these factors.
Results
In total, 225 participants completed the questionnaire from
households in St. George and St. Andrew parishes, with a
participation rate of 80.1%. Participants were mostly female
(55.1%) and nonsmokers (85.3%), with a mean age of 38.9 ±
8.1 years. According to the participant demographics, there
was no statistical difference between the two parishes. The
practice of bush burning occurred in 43% (n = 96) of the
households regularly every month. Twenty-eight (29.17%) par-
ticipants who practice bush burning burned twice a month and
the rest of them burned once a month. The nonrural parish of
St. George accounted for 38 of 96 households (40%) that
practice bush burning. One hundred ninety-two participants
(86%) stated that their neighbors burn bush regularly, with
47% (90/192) of them from St. George parish (nonrural).
Analysis revealed that 12.3% of those who practice bush
burning reported that they would also burn trash on their
property but this was only done rarely. The local waste autho-
rities collected garbage from 99.0% of these participants at
least once per week.

1149Table 1 shows the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among
the overall participants and associated odds ratios. The odds ratios
were computed as those who stated they burn bush versus those
who stated that they do not burn bush. The most common lower
respiratory symptom over the past 12 months was dry cough
(31.4%). The most common upper respiratory symptoms over
the past 12 months were sneezing (44.3%) and runny nose
(33.1%). The participants who engaged in bush burning had a
statistically signiﬁcant higher prevalence of sinusitis symptoms.
(OR: 2.1, CI 95%: 1.1–3.9) and had a slightly higher prevalence
of cough (OR: 1.5, CI 95%: 0.9–2.8). Prevalences of physician-
diagnosed asthma and sinusitis were 12.3% (n = 27) and 31.2%
(n = 69), respectively. The participants who did practice bush
burning had a slightly high prevalence of physician-diagnosed
sinusitis (OR: 1.4, CI 95%: 0.8–2.5) and prevalence of physician-
diagnosed asthma (OR: 1.3, CI 95%: 0.7–2.8).
A statistically signiﬁcant relationship exists between the
participants’ location and the nasal symptoms. Persons from
St. George (nonrural) have higher prevalence of runny nose
than persons from St. Andrew (rural) during or after bush
burning (OR: 2.5, CI 95%: 1.3–4.9). Respondents from St.
George (nonrural) also have higher prevalence of asthma-like
symptoms than persons from St. Andrew (rural) during or after
bush burning (OR: 1.8, CI 95%: 1.1–2.6).
Discussion
In this study, we measured the frequency of bush burning
practice and investigated the relationship between bush burning
practice and respiratory health in Grenada. Although the local
waste authorities regularly collected garbage, household bush
burning is still a common practice in Grenada and occurs
throughout the entire year.
In our study, we noticed that the participants who engaged
in the practice of bush burning had a slightly higher prevalence
of cough and physician-diagnosed asthma. However, we did
not observe a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between bush
burning and lower respiratory symptoms. This result may have
been due to the fact that persons who are sick with lower
respiratory symptoms do not want to participate in bush burn-
ing and the fact that there are many different factors that may
contribute to the risk of lower respiratory symptoms. There is
potential exposure misclassiﬁcation, especially those who do
not burn but are still exposed to air pollutants from neighbors’
burning. As a result, it is possible that we were not able to
detect a statistically signiﬁcant relationship through calculation
of the odds ratios for lower respiratory symptoms. This would
be particularly true if survey participants also did not under-
stand how to categorize or identify symptoms such as “wheez-
ing.” Survey participants may have inaccurately reported their
lower airway symptoms, resulting in further misclassiﬁcation
bias. Misclassiﬁcation bias often makes detection through the
computation of odds ratios more difﬁcult and may explain the
lack of statistical signiﬁcance among those measures. For this
reason, the relationship between bush burning and their respira-
tory symptoms could not be fully captured. Previous studies
have found associations between burning of plant material and
increased risk of asthma and respiratory related symptoms. A
study conducted by Jacobs et al. analyzing the health impact of
the burning of planted rice ﬁelds in California found that the
risk for daily asthma related hospitalizations increased per acre

Akpinar-Elci et al. / Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association 65 (2015) 1148–1152of rice that was burned (Jacobs et al., 1997). Another study
conducted by Jose et al. in Piracicaba, Brazil, found the
respiratory status of the region’s inhabitants was most at risk
during the months where sugar-cane burning occurred, due to
the related release of particulate matter (Cançado, 2006). These
periods would last at least 6 months and cause chronic expo-
sure. In yet another Brazilian city, Araraquara, Arbex et al.
similarly found that increased total suspended particles in the
air from the burning of sugar cane burning was signiﬁcantly
associated with hospital admissions of asthma related cases
(Arbex et al., 2007). These studies were however conducted
where burning was done on a larger scale and for longer
periods of time. However, in our study, bush burning was
done by the participants for disposing of cuttings from the
area around their homes, which is on a smaller scale. This
reduces the total amount of particulate matter released into
the immediate surrounding atmosphere and may reduce the
duration of exposure.
In our study, we observed a statistically signiﬁcant higher
prevalence of sinusitis symptoms among the bush burner group.
We also noticed that the prevalence of physician-diagnosed sinu-
sitis was high (31.2%), and the participants who engaged in the
practice of bush burning had a slightly higher prevalence of
physician-diagnosed sinusitis. There was not related to demo-
graphic characteristics of the survey participants. Previous studies
addressed overall respiratory health effects of biomass burning;
however, there is no speciﬁc study on the relationship between
sinusitis and bush burning practice. As we stated in one of our
previous studies, some of the most underestimated and least
known respiratory problems related to environmental exposures
are upper airways diseases, including sinusitis, which can cause
systemic symptoms and decrease quality of life (Akpinar-Elci
et al., 2011). Therefore, this study, which showed the link between
sinusitis symptoms and the practice of bush burning, might be
helpful in understanding early detection and appropriate manage-
ment of upper airway diseases related to environmental exposure
and preventing other conditions, such as asthma.
We also observed a statistically signiﬁcant relationship
between the participants’ location and some of the respiratory
symptoms during or after bush burning. Respondents from St.
George, which is a nonrural setting, had a higher prevalence of
nasal symptoms and asthma-like symptoms during or after the
bush burning practice. The parish of St. George is the most
densely populated parish in Grenada, which was thought to
have increased the probability of individual exposure to bush
burning emissions and increase respiratory symptoms.
A major limitation exists in that this study relied upon the
cross-sectional design and participant-reported data, which
may have been prone to recall bias. This bias may have been
further ampliﬁed due to the length of time between the burn-
ings and/or the lack of severity of symptoms. As this was a
cross-sectional study, we also did not have data on the expo-
sure history of survey participants. The interaction of smoking
with bush burning on symptoms could also not be fully
assessed because the majority of our survey participants did
not smoke and we had low statistical power, which may
explain the lack of any statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings between
comparisons of smokers and nonsmokers. Another potential
limitation of the study may have been due to the fact that
persons who are sick with respiratory symptoms may be too
unwell to participate in bush burning. In addition, the inter-
pretation of the results is also limited by the lack of air pollu-
tion measurements collected during burning. At the time of this
study, there were no available personnel on the island with the
skills and resources necessary to measure air pollutants. As
such, differences and variation in exposure among survey
participants could not be assessed beyond broad generaliza-
tions about whether the survey participate burned bush or did
not burn bush. In addition, this practice is extremely wide-
spread in the island, and as a result all residents, even those
who don’t burn themselves, are likely exposed to some air
pollution from bush burning by neighbors. As such, it is not
possible to categorize survey participants as “not exposed” and
“exposed” since all survey respondents likely had some expo-
sure, which could contribute to misclassiﬁcation bias in the
computation of odds ratios. For these reasons, the relationship
between bush burning and their respiratory symptoms could
not be fully captured. Strengths of the study included the high
participation rate and the random sampling strategy. Thus, we
believed that the result of the study represented the proﬁle of
Grenada, including rural and nonrural settings. According to
our knowledge, there are no studies in the small-scale house-
hold bush burning and respiratory problems from developing
world. Readers need to keep in mind that geographical remote-
ness and limited infrastructure are a challenge during the data
collection process in a developing country setting such as
Grenada. Therefore, we believe that the result of our study
could be invaluable to inform the scientiﬁc communities.
The health effects of biomass smoke exposure has been
extensively studied, relating to residential exposure to wood-
stoves or cook stoves as indoor exposure, or community-wide
exposure from wild ﬁres or agricultural burning. However,
there are not enough studies about the health effects of the
household bush burning practice, which is smaller scale and
constant. Therefore, conducting health effects of biomass stu-
dies in different settings and using different practices, such as
the household bush burning practice in our current study, could
help to improve public health in the developing world.

Abstract
Background: Effect of indoor air pollution (IAP) on birth weight remains largely unexplored but yet purported as
the most important environmental exposure for pregnant women in developing countries due to the effects of
second-hand smoke. We investigated the associations between the determinants of indoor air quality in
households and birth weight.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of 592 mothers and their newborns using postnatal services at the Korle Bu
Teaching Hospital located in Accra, Ghana was conducted in 2010 to collect information on characteristics of
indoor environment and other potential determinants of fetal growth. Birth weight was recorded from hospital
records.
Results: Household cooking fuel choices and garbage burning practices were determinants of birth weight.
Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for age, social class, marital status and gravidity of mothers, and sex
of neonate resulted in a 243g (95% CI: 496, 11) and 178g (95% CI: 421, 65) reduction in birth weight for use of
charcoal, and garbage burning respectively compared with use of LPG only. The estimated reductions in birth
weight was not statistically significant. Applying the ordinal scale exposure parameter nonetheless revealed a
significant exposure-response relationship between maternal exposures from charcoal use and garbage burning,
and birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting for confounders resulted in a 41% (risk ratio [RR] = 1.41; 95%
CI: 0.62, 3.23) and 195% (RR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.10, 7.92) increase in the risk of low birth weight (LBW) for use of
charcoal, and garbage burning respectively compared with use of LPG only. A combination of charcoal use and
household garbage burning during pregnancy on fetal growth resulted in a 429g (95% CI: 259, 599) reduction in
birth weight and 316% (RR=4.16; 95% CI: 2.02, 8.59) excess risk of LBW. Sensitivity analysis performed by restricting
the analysis to term births produced similar results.
Conclusions: Maternal use of charcoal as a cooking fuel during pregnancy and burning of garbage at home are
strong determinants of average fetal growth and risk of LBW. Efforts to reduce maternal exposures to IAP are thus
important to improve birth outcomes.

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/78Background
Birth weight is an important determinant and predictor
of neonatal and infantile growth and survival, as well as
health in childhood and later life. Low birth weight
(LBW), defined by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as birth weight less than 2500 grams [1] is
closely associated with neonatal and infant mortality and
morbidity, reduced growth, impaired immune function
and poor cognitive development [2]. LBW has also been
associated with childhood and adult disorders such as
asthma [3], type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary
heart disease in many studies [4,5].
Birth weight is determined by multiple factors with
Sohl and Moore [6] estimating heredity and environmen-
tal factors to account for 40% and 60% of birth weight re-
spectively.
Stephenson
and
Symonds
[7]
have
also
suggested that about 60% of the variation in birth weight
can be explained by environmental factors. Environmen-
tal factors are therefore clearly important determinants
of birth weight. Spencer and Logan [8] note that secular
changes in birth weight, birth weight variations within
genetically similar populations, and birth weight depic-
tion of a reverse social gradient such that increasing dis-
advantage is associated with decreasing birth weight all
suggest an environmental influence.
The maternal household environment has been proposed
to have a strong influence on birth weight. Stephenson and
Symonds [7] identified the general and immediate maternal
environment to account for almost 40% of the variation in
birth weight attributable to environmental factors. Cooking
fuels such as charcoal and wood, and garbage burning are
important sources of indoor air pollution in maternal
households with poor ventilation of homes often worsening
indoor air pollution. The relationship between indoor air
pollution (IAP) and birth weight remains largely unexplored
with studies in Guatemala [9,10], Zimbabwe [11], Pakistan
[12] and India [13,14] that reported association of biomass
fuel use with reduced and low birth weight identified to be
the only studies to have examined this relationship.
The apparent lack of research on the link between indoor
air pollution and birth weight is totally at variance with the
widespread projection of indoor air pollution as the most
important environmental exposure for pregnant women es-
pecially in developing countries due to the effects of
second-hand smoke. It is against this background that our
objective was to study the associations between the deter-
minants of indoor air quality such as cooking fuel choices,
cooking sequence and patterns, and household garbage
burning practices, and birth weight in Accra households.
Methods
Study design and site
A cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers
and newborns of the Maternity Department of the Korle
Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH). KBTH is located in the
south-western part of Accra and serves as the national
referral centre for southern Ghana. The catchment area
of KBTH's Maternity Department are communities in
the south-western corridor of Accra. The comprehensive
and specialist services on offer at KBTH as a whole sees
majority of mothers residing in the south-western part
of Accra preferring this facility to others in the area that
equally provides Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)
services. Mothers from other parts of Accra and sur-
rounding areas also access RCH services at KBTH for
the very same reason or because they have been referred
for an underlying health risk.
Study population and sampling procedure
The source population comprised all nursing mothers
residing in Accra. Six hundred and forty seven mothers
that had singleton deliveries with no gross anatomical de-
formities at KBTH Maternity Department and accessing
postnatal services at the same facility were randomly
sampled from a shortlist provided by the department's
Biostatistics Unit. Selected mothers who visited the post-
natal clinic were interviewed after verification that they
were non- referral patients, and resided in Accra and
their respective neighbourhood throughout the duration
of the pregnancy. The study population included 592
newborns (response rate 91.5%).
Exposure assessment
We studied the independent and joint effects of charcoal
usage and garbage burning on fetal growth. Exposure in-
formation was collected by using a structured question-
naire to obtain information on the type of cooking fuel
used, type and ventilation rating of cooking enclosure,
frequency and duration of cooking activities, amount of
time spent in cooking area during cooking sessions,
practice of garbage burning in household, frequency of
garbage burning, and presence of mother during garbage
burning sessions.
Households using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) only
without charcoal or garbage burning constituted the
reference category. The two main household fuel types
were used alone and in combination. To study the inde-
pendent and joint effects of these together with garbage
burning we used the following exposure categories: (1)
charcoal use only, (2) charcoal and LPG use, (3) garbage
burning only, (4) both LPG use and garbage burning,
and (5) both charcoal use and garbage burning. For
charcoal and garbage burning we also used ordinal scale
exposure parameter: low, moderate and high.
The level of exposure to charcoal and garbage burning
was defined as follows. For use of charcoal only, step
one involved (a) classifying the following as high expos-
ure practices: cooking up to the seventh or ninth month
Amegah et al. Environmental Health 2012, 11:78
Page 2 of 10
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/78of pregnancy, cooking frequency of four or more times
per week, staying in cooking area throughout the whole
duration of each cooking session, and cooking area ven-
tilation ratings of poor or satisfactory, and (b) classifying
the following as low exposure practices: cooking up to
the sixth month of pregnancy, cooking frequency of less
than four times per week, staying in cooking area for up
to about half the duration of each cooking session, and
cooking area ventilation ratings of good, very good or
excellent. Step two involved (a) classifying maternal re-
port of all four high exposure practices or a combination
of any three high exposure practices and any one low ex-
posure practice as high exposure; (b) classifying mater-
nal report of a combination of any two high exposure
practices and any two low exposure practices as moder-
ate exposure, and (c) classifying maternal report of all
four low exposure practices or a combination of any
three low exposure practices and any one high exposure
practices as low exposure.
With regards to garbage burning only, step one
involved (a) classifying the following as high exposure
practices: garbage burning frequency of four or more
times per week, and regular presence in household dur-
ing combustion, and (b) classifying the following as low
exposure practices: garbage burning frequency of less
than four times per week, and occasional presence in
household during combustion. Step two involved (a)
classifying maternal report of the two high exposure
practices as high exposure, (b) classifying maternal re-
port of a combination of any one high exposure practice
and any one low exposure practice as moderate expos-
ure, and (c) classifying maternal report of the two low
exposure practices as low exposure.
Outcomes
The main outcome was fetal growth which was mea-
sured both as birth weight in grams and low birth weight
(birth weight below 2500 grams). Birth weight of the
newborns was obtained from hospital records. An RGZ-
20 baby scale which measures birth weight in kilograms
up to two decimal places was used at the facility to
weigh newborns immediately after birth. The scale was
regularly calibrated by the health staff.
Ethical considerations
Ethical approval was sought for the study from Ghana
Health Service Ethical Review Committee. Informed
consent form was used to seek the consent of all partici-
pants before inclusion in the study.
Statistical analysis
We compared the average birth weight and the risk of
low birth weight according to categories of charcoal and
garbage burning-related exposure using t-test and Chi-
square test to assess the role of chance. Chi-square test
was also used to investigate the differences in cooking
fuel choices of mothers according to their socioeco-
nomic characteristics. We applied multivariate methods
for assessing the exposure-outcome relations. First, we
applied multiple linear regression to estimate the inde-
pendent and joint effects of the two exposures on aver-
age birth weight. Second, we applied generalized linear
models (PROC GENMOD) with Poisson distribution
and log link to estimate the independent and joint
effects of indoor air pollution on the risk of LBW. All
models were adjusted for age, social class, marital status
and gravidity of mothers; and sex of neonate. Pearson's
correlation and Mantel-Haenszel linear by linear Chi-
square test was used for trend analysis of the exposure-
response relationships. We performed sensitivity analysis
by restricting the analysis to term births (≥37 weeks of
gestation). SPSS version 16.0 was used to perform all the
analysis with the exception of the PROC GENMOD ana-
lysis which was done with SAS version 9.3.
Results
The characteristics of the mothers and their neonates
are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. More than half
(58.8%) of the respondents were classified as low social
class with about 5% of the respondents identified as high
social class. A quarter (25.3%) of the respondents were
young mothers (<24 years) with older mothers (>35
years) making up about 15% of the respondents studied.
Majority of the respondents (77.2%) were married. A
high proportion of the respondents (45.1%) were edu-
cated up to junior high level. About 7% of the respon-
dents
had
no
formal
education.
Majority
of
the
respondents (43.6%) were traders and street vendors.
Hairdressers and seamstresses made up about 30% of
the respondents studied. The proportion of office work-
ers was 6%. About 39% of the respondents were primi-
gravida. Of the mothers studied, 94.3% were cooking
during pregnancy. Half of the mothers who cooked
(50.5%) used charcoal only with about 29% of them
using LPG only. About 19% of the mothers used a com-
bination of both fuels. Cooking fuel choices of mothers
was dependent on their social class, educational level
and occupation. Of the proportion of charcoal users,
and charcoal & LPG users, more than half respectively
were identified as low social class. Of the proportion of
mothers identified as high social class, majority used
LPG for cooking. Also, of the proportion of mothers
with no formal education and those educated up to jun-
ior high level, over half of them used charcoal for cook-
ing. Of the tertiary educated mothers, over half of them
used LPG for cooking. Charcoal users were mostly tra-
ders,
street
vendors,
hairdressers
and
seamstresses.
Office workers mostly used LPG for cooking. About 27%

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/78of the mothers studied reported garbage burning in their
homes during pregnancy. The proportion of mothers
using charcoal only for cooking and burning garbage at
home simultaneously was 15%.
More than half of the neonates (53.2%) were males. First
order births made up about 38% of the neonates. Neo-
nates delivered to charcoal users, and charcoal & LPG
users were respectively 322g and 254g lighter than neo-
nates delivered to LPG users. The differences in means
were highly
significant. Also,
neonates
delivered
to
mothers burning garbage at home were 310g lighter than
neonates delivered to LPG users. The mean difference was
also significant. Neonates delivered to mothers using char-
coal only for cooking as well as burning garbage at home
were 392g lighter than neonates delivered to LPG user.
The mean difference was statistically significant. About
18% of the neonates were born LBW. The risk of LBW
was related to fuel choices and garbage burning practices
of mothers, independently and jointly.
The unadjusted and adjusted effect of cooking fuel use
and garbage burning at home on birth weight and risk
of LBW are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Charcoal
use and garbage burning at home were all determinants
of reduced birth weight. The estimated reduction in
birth weight was 243g (95% CI: 496, 11) and 178g (95%
CI: 421, 65) for use of charcoal, and garbage burning at
home. The associations were however not statistically
significant.
An
exposure-response
relationship
was
nonetheless noted with high exposure from charcoal use
and garbage burning associated with an increased reduc-
tion in birth weight. A linear trend test of the association
was statistically significant. The use of charcoal together

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/78with garbage burning at home was associated with fur-
ther reductions in birth weight. The estimated reduction
in birth weight was 429g (95% CI: 259, 599).
Use of charcoal and garbage burning at home were risk
factors for LBW. Garbage burning at home resulted in a
195% increase in the risk of LBW. High exposure from
garbage burning was also associated with a 359% increase
in the risk of LBW. A linear trend test of the association
was statistically significant. Charcoal use generally was
associated with a small and statistically insignificant in-
crease in the risk of LBW. Applying the ordinal scale ex-
posure parameter for charcoal however resulted in a
statistically significant association, albeit an inverse trend
was observed with high exposure associated with decrease
risk. Charcoal use together with garbage burning at home
was associated with further increase in the risk of LBW.
The estimated increase in the risk of LBW for joint char-
coal use and garbage burning was 316%.
The sensitivity analysis produced similar results but
with slightly lower effect estimates generally.
Discussion
The results of our study indicate a strong, exposure-
related inverse association between maternal use of char-
coal as cooking fuel during pregnancy and birth weight
of the newborn. The average birth weight of babies born
among exposed mother was 243g (95% CI: 496, 11)
lower compared with the babies of mothers using LPG
as cooking fuel. Garbage burning at home was an im-
portant risk factor for LBW. Garbage burning was asso-
ciated with a 195% (RR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.10, 7.92)
increase in the risk of LBW. Joint evaluation of these
two exposures resulted in further reductions in birth
weight and additional increase in the risk of LBW.
Validity of results
We selected consecutive mothers giving birth in a teach-
ing hospital and thus the study population represents a
defined catchment area. We achieved a high response
rate (91.5%) which minimizes selection bias. Mothers giv-
ing birth at KBTH as against other facilities in the study
area where not a distinct cohort from the source popula-
tion but do so mainly because of the hospital's proximity
to their homes and/or the comprehensive and specialist
services on offer. We also carefully excluded mothers re-
ferred to the facility for whatever reason from the study.
The outcome of interest was measured and recorded in-
dependently from the study and represent a well defined
and objective variable with a negligible measurement
error. Information on exposure and potential confoun-
ders was collected retrospectively. Use of cooking fuel
choices and garbage burning practices represents quanti-
tatively well-defined entity and it is reasonable to assume
that retrospective data collection resulted in relatively re-
liable data on maternal exposure during pregnancy. The
ordinal scale exposure variable per the use of maternal
report of fuel type, and cooking and garbage burning
practices was sensitive to certain amount of measure-
ment error but was however not likely to be related to
the outcome of interest. In summary, it reasonable to as-
sume the exposure assessment reflects reasonably well
the exposure conditions during pregnancy.
Although we applied a cross-sectional study design, we
were able to collect reasonably valid exposure information

in fetal growth and therefore our results support a causal
relation between the exposures and the outcome of inter-
est. Establishment of temporal relation may be problematic
in some research settings with the use of cross-sectional
study design. This however should not be a concern in our
study because it is clear that exposure to combustion pol-
lutants was present during pregnancy among mothers who
cooked with charcoal and those who reported garbage
burning at their homes. Also it was increasingly clear
from the information collected from the mothers and
summarized by the investigators that the choices of
cooking fuels and garbage burning activities remained
relatively stable in our research settings. It is possible that
some women using charcoal during most of the duration
of pregnancy might have reported use of LPG as their
primary fuel, but this information bias would rather tend
to underestimate the true effect. We were not able to

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/78undertake air quality measurements in homes of the
mothers. The potential for exposure misclassification
nonetheless is reduced in our study because the quantita-
tive assessment of exposure to combustion pollutants
from charcoal use and garbage burning comprised sev-
eral types of information collected from participants and
summarized by the investigators, including duration of
cooking, time spent in cooking area, type of ventilation
applied as well as frequency of garbage burning at home
and how often mothers were present during combustion.
The study adjusted for the effect of age, social class,
marital status and gravidity of mothers, and sex of neo-
nate in the analysis. We had reliable information on ges-
tational age of mothers but did not consider it as a
covariate in the analysis based on a recent work by
Wilcox and colleagues [15] which reported gestational
age as a collider and provided evidence of the likely bias
produced by adjustment for gestational age in statistical
analysis. We were however unable to examine the effect
of other determinants of birth weight such as maternal
nutrition and anthropometry, malaria and sexually trans-
mitted infections. IAP exposure during pregnancy is not
expected to be dependent on these factors hence the
estimated effect of IAP exposure on birth weight is not
likely to be confounded by these factors. Maternal smok-
ing is another important determinant of birth weight,
but in Ghana only few women smoke. The 2008 Ghana
Demographic and Health Survey [16] estimated the pro-
portion of women smoking cigarettes and other tobacco
products to be 0.4%. Maternal smoking can therefore
not be considered as a serious threat to validity in this
study.

(p<0.0001), educational level (p<0.0001) and occupation
(p<0.0001) of mothers and likely to influence IAP expos-
ure experience during pregnancy. LPG was the primary
fuel of high social class mothers with charcoal the pre-
ferred fuel of low social class mothers. Uneducated and
semi-literate
(educated
up
to
junior
high
school)
mothers preferred charcoal with tertiary level educated
mothers patronizing LPG. Traders, street vendors, hair-
dressers and seamstresses had preference for charcoal
with office workers preferring LPG. Studies in Ethiopia
[17], Cameroun [18] and Kenya [19] also associated
household cooking fuel choices with employment, in-
come, educational level and social class of women. We
adjusted for the effect of social class but not educational
level and occupation of mothers in the analysis due to
the well known fact that education and occupation
determines social class of an individual, and also the fact
they were unrelated to birth weight in our analysis. Con-
trolling for confounding by social class is always prob-
lematic especially in our study where more than half
(58.8%) of the study participants were low social class.
This is due to the strong effects of social class on health
outcomes. We do not therefore overrule the possibility
of residual confounding by social class in our study, but
we think residual confounding does not solely explain
our observations on the adverse effects of combustion
products from charcoal and garbage burning.
Synthesis with previous studies
A systematic literature search identified six previous
studies conducted in Guatemala [9,10], Zimbabwe [11],
Pakistan [12] and India [13,14] that have assessed the
relationship between indoor pollution from solid fuel
use and birth weight. The study in Guatemala [9] found
babies born to mothers who used wood to be 63g lighter
than babies born to mothers who used gas or electricity.
The other study in Guatemala [10] was a randomized
control trial and found infants born to mothers who
used open fires (control group) to be on average 89g
lighter than infants whose mothers used a chimney stove
(intervention group). The study in Zimbabwe [11] found
babies born to mothers cooking with wood, dung, or
straw to be on average 175g lighter compared with ba-
bies born to mothers using LPG, natural gas, or electri-
city. In the Pakistan study [12], infants born to wood
users were on average 82g lighter than infants born to
natural gas users. This study also estimated the popula-
tion attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use to
be 24%. The earlier Indian study [13] found infants born
to women from households using wood and/or dung as
primary cooking fuel to be 104.5g lighter than infants
born to mothers from households using biogas or kero-
sene. This study also reported exposure to biomass fuel
to be associated with an adjusted 49% increased risk of
LBW. The recent Indian study [14] found children born
in households using high pollution fuels (wood, straw,
animal dung, crop residues, kerosene, coal and charcoal)
to be 73g lighter than those born in households using
low pollution fuels (electricity, LPG, natural gas and bio-
gas). A recent meta-analysis [20] of five studies examin-
ing this relationship also estimated a reduced mean birth
weight of 95.6g (95% CI: 68.5, 124.7) and an increase risk
of LBW of 38% (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.52) among
women exposed to IAP. This study also estimated the
population attributable risk for LBW explained by IAP
to be 21%.
The findings of our study are consistent with these
previous studies albeit our effect estimates were quite
larger than any previously reported. The similar results
produced from the sensitivity analysis means use of
charcoal as cooking fuel and garbage burning at home
represents an important threat to optimal fetal growth.
We do not by any means imply with the large effect
sizes reported that charcoal is a high polluting and more
potent fuel than other biomass like wood, dung and crop
residue. Garbage burning on the other hand releases
Amegah et al. Environmental Health 2012, 11:78
Page 7 of 10
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/11/1/78dioxins, hazardous chemical substances that have been
shown in animal studies to severely impair fetal growth
even at low levels of exposure. Studies in human popula-
tions have also reported associations of low level dioxin
exposure during pregnancy with decreased birth weight
[21-24]. Our study and the previous reviewed however
did not actually measure the quantity of biomass com-
busted and the amount of pollutants released for which
mothers were exposed. It is therefore reasonable to as-
sume that our study participants might have on average
combusted large quantities of charcoal and garbage
during pregnancy with the cumulative adverse effect
reflected in the large effect estimates reported. The sig-
nificant exposure-response relationship observed by our
study to some extent confirms this assertion. We must
however emphasize that unmeasured confounding, and
residual confounding by social class as already noted
could contribute to the large effect sizes reported in
spite of efforts to eliminate this potential confounding
from our study.
The studies highlighted however had some limitations
which our study was purposely designed to address and
strengthen the epidemiological evidence. Firstly, the
studies in Zimbabwe [11] and India [14] relied on
mothers self-report of child size at birth in respectively
estimating birth weight of 47% and 60% of their study
infants. This could have resulted in under or over esti-
mation of birth weight of these infants. Secondly, the
other studies cited [9,10,12,13] were community-based
and obtaining timely measurement of birth weight of
infants delivered at home was problematic. The time of
measurement in some cases raises doubt about their ac-
ceptability as true reflection of birth weight of these
infants. A baby's weight can fluctuate within the first
week of life with newborns losing up to 10% of their
birth weight during the first 3–5 days of life. Some of
the studies in an attempt to address this limitation,
restricted birth weight analysis to newborns weighed
within 48–72 hours after birth. Lastly, majority of house-
holds in developing countries use a combination of
cooking fuels with those in urban areas especially usually
using a combination of polluting and clean fuels as a
way of reducing household fuel bills and to at times has-
ten the preparation of meals. In Ghana for instance, ma-
jority of urban households mostly use LPG for preparing
sauces, stews, soups and continental meals with charcoal
used mainly for preparing staple foods such as banku,
fufu and ampesi. Most of the households that use LPG
for cooking are also compelled to rely on charcoal when
LPG is in short supply. All the studies highlighted
collected information on primary cooking fuel of partici-
pants without attempting to identify participants using a
combination of cooking fuels. This distinction is import-
ant for proper quantification of exposure experiences of
study participants. For instance, in settings where use of
combination of polluting and clean fuels prevails, asses-
sing only primary cooking fuel could result in under or
over estimation of exposure. About 19% of the mothers
who participated in our study used a combination of
charcoal and LPG for cooking.
Our study to the best of our knowledge is the first to
examine the contribution of garbage burning at home to
the indoor exposure experience of pregnant women, and
its relation with birth weight of newborns. Over a quar-
ter (27%) of the mothers studied reported garbage burn-
ing in their homes during pregnancy. Garbage burning is
a frequent practice in a number of Ghanaian urban
households as a way of managing their solid waste. This
is because most urban areas especially the secluded and
deprived zones are usually not reached with waste col-
lection services. Areas receiving these services are also
faced with untimely and irregular service provision. In
rural Ghana, the situation is different with younger
members of the household tasked with disposing of the
household waste at designated sites in the community
each morning. The sight of garbage burning in rural
households is therefore uncommon.
Biological plausibility
Burning of charcoal, other solid fuels and garbage emits
smoke which contains a number of air pollutants includ-
ing carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM).
Inhaled CO and PM impairs fetal growth in two ways;
(1) CO combines with hemoglobin to cross the placenta
decreasing oxygen supply to tissue which limits the abil-
ity of the placenta to transfer nutrients to the fetus, and
(2) PM reduces maternal lung function thereby increas-
ing the risk of maternal lung disease, and in turn redu-
cing oxygen delivery to the fetus as well as causing cell
damage in the fetus through oxidative stress [25,26].
Impaired fetal growth subsequently leads to reduced or
low birth weight [26,27]. Also, reduced oxygen transport
across the placenta and fetal uptake due to reduced oxy-
gen supply to the placenta can result in preterm delivery
and consequently reduced or low birth weight [27]. The
fetus in particular is considered to be highly susceptible
to environmental pollutants because of its differential
exposure pattern and physiological immaturity [28,29].
The high cell proliferation and changing metabolic
mechanisms during the critical phase of fetal develop-
ment have been identified as the physiological process
that renders the developing fetus extremely vulnerable
to environmental toxicants [30].
Conclusions
Our results proved evidence that maternal use of char-
coal as a cooking fuel during pregnancy and burning of
garbage at home are strong determinants of average fetal

"Inadequate provision of solid waste management facilities in
Third World cities results in indiscriminate disposal and un-
sanitary environments, which threatens the health of urhan residents. The study reported
here examined household-level waste management and disposal practices in the Accra
Metropolitan Area, Ghana. Tbe residents of Accra cunently generate large amounts of sol-
id waste, heyond the management capabilities of the existing waste management system.
Because the solid waste infrastructure is inadequate, over 80 percent of the population
do not have home collection services. Only 13.5 percent of respondents are served witb
door-to-door collection of solid waste, while tbe rest dispose of tbeir waste at eommunal
collection points, in open spaces, and in waterways. The majority of households store
tbeir waste in open containers and plastic bags in the bome. Waste storage in tbe home is
associated with the presence of bouseflies in the kitchen (r = .17, p < .0001). Tbe presence
of houseflies in the kitchen during cooking is correlated with the incidence of childhood
diarrhea (r = .36, p < .0001). Inadequate solid waste facilities result in indiscriminate
hurning and burying of solid waste. There is an association between waste burning and the
incidence of respiratory health symptoms among adults (r = .25, p < .0001) and children
(r = .22, p < .05). Poor handling and disposal of waste are major causes of environmental

Domestic, or household-level, open burning of plastic waste is a source of air pollutants and greenhouse
gases that are often neglected in emission inventories. Domestic open burning is a considerable concern
in Guatemala due to the lack of access to waste collection services, particularly in rural areas. This paper
oﬀers the ﬁrst attempt to estimate emissions from the domestic open burning of waste at the city and
departmental levels in Guatemala. Data were collected from the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala
and analyzed to determine the change in plastic waste generation over time as well as the
socioeconomic factors that may aﬀect the extent of plastic waste generation and burning. The annual
per capita masses of plastic waste burned were used to estimate emissions from domestic open burning
of plastic waste in the region of Xalap´an, the cities of Jutiapa and Guatemala city, and all 22 departments
in Guatemala. Our results show that rural areas burn more waste domestically, likely because of a lack of
access to waste collection, and 30.4% of OC, 24.0% of BC, 23.6% of PM2.5, and 2.4% of CO2 emissions in
Guatemala may not be accounted for by excluding open plastic burning as a source.
Environmental signicance
Domestic burning of plastic waste is a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and household air pollution (HAP) that aﬀects human health. This is of
particular concern in countries such as Guatemala, where burning is a main method of waste disposal in rural areas. Current emission inventories do not
include emission data on the domestic open burning of plastic waste, which is an under sampled and understudied source of emissions. We nd that including
emissions from the domestic burning of plastic waste in emission inventories would notably increase current emission estimates. Quantifying such emissions
can prevent underestimation of emissions, provide more accurate local, departmental, and national total emission estimates, and inform ways to mitigate the
release of GHGs and HAP.

Introduction
The open burning of plastic waste in domestic, or household-
level, res is a global human health and climate change
concern that has not been well studied. Burning of plastic waste
is of particular concern in the Global South,1–4 especially in
countries such as Guatemala, where the management of solid
waste has become an issue due to a lack of access to infra-
structure, resources, and services necessary to properly manage
and dispose of waste.5 For this reason, waste is oen disposed
of through methods that are harmful to the environment,
including disposing through burning, burial, or in bodies of
water.6 This is particularly concerning for plastic waste, as
plastics that enter marine ecosystems through these waste
disposal methods can accumulate in sediments and induce
physiological stress in aquatic organisms and food chains if
ingested.7–10
In Guatemala, where the present study was conducted,
plastics make up approximately 17.3% of waste generated,11,12
and 43% of all households dispose of their waste, including
plastic, through domestic burning.6 These percentages increase
in more rural areas of the country, which have fewer waste
disposal resources and are in remote locations, far from
municipal waste services.5,6,13 Residents of such areas must
resort to domestic burning to dispose of plastic waste, which
poses the risk of releasing toxic air pollutants into their home
environment. Thus, waste burning could indicate that waste
collection infrastructure must be improved to create better ways
to dispose of waste.

View Journal  | View IssueDomestic plastic waste burning can occur both in outdoor
trash res and indoor kitchen res using solid fuel cookstoves.
A laboratory study quantifying emissions from cookstoves
found that although plastic bags produced fewer emissions
than other startup materials, such as kerosene, newspapers,
fabric, and wood shims, the burning of plastic bags to ignite
res still contributed to increased cookstove re emissions.14
Plastic waste burning contributes to emissions of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and toxic substances, including carbon dioxide
(CO2), ne particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of
2.5 mm or less (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC),
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs).15–19 The chemical composition of PM2.5
due to plastic waste incineration and smoldering res includes
BC, OC, ammonium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, antimony (Sb),
and other trace elements.16
Household air pollution (HAP) from the burning of plastic
waste in stoves20 and cooking res poses a harmful respiratory,
cardiovascular, and overall human health hazard.21–26 A recent
study measured EFs for solely dry plastic waste burns and found
that using dry plastic waste instead of biofuels can decrease
open waste burning emissions, although these burns were
conducted in improved devices as opposed to those in more
traditional stoves.20 The health threat from waste burning is still
a particular concern for women and children, as they primarily
occupy the domestic sphere.27–29 In Guatemala, ambient PM2.5
exposure is estimated to result in 4105 annual deaths, 2420 total
years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLD), and 1.4 billion
USD in health damages, including the cost of minimizing the
likelihood of premature death, or mortality, and the cost of
morbidity based on the country's average wage rates.30,31
However, despite being a source of GHG emissions and HAP,
domestic waste burning, usually a mix of organic and inorganic
materials, like plastic, is scarcely sampled and is understudied
as a source of emissions.17 Current emission inventories have
limited data from domestic burning of plastic waste, which
could result in an underestimation of total emissions.32–34
Accurately quantifying emissions is important for determining
mixing ratios of GHGs and mass concentrations of other air
pollutants released into the air from diﬀerent emission sour-
ces.16,17,28 Our study examined plastic waste generation in
households in one community in the Xalap´an region in the
Department of Jalapa to estimate emissions of various pollut-
ants from plastic burning and to determine the eﬀects of
potential interventions to reduce plastic waste among study
participants. In our study, “plastic” refers to mostly single-use
household plastic items, such as plastic packaging, bags,
plates,
utensils,
straws,
gloves,
bottles,
and
containers,
disposed of by the participants in our study.
Since domestic burning of plastic waste is a common form of
waste disposal in Guatemala, the purpose of this paper is to
estimate emissions and contributions to total national emis-
sions from the domestic burning of plastic waste. This study is
the rst local and regional emission estimate of chemical
species due to the domestic burning of plastic waste in Guate-
mala. We estimated emissions from domestic plastic waste
burning in Guatemala, including: (1) in the La Fuente rural
community from the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala; (2) at
the
departmental
level
for
Guatemala's
22
departments
(Fig. S1†);6 (3) in Jutiapa, the capital city of the Department of
Jutiapa, which has a population that is about equally urban and
rural, and is located approximately 40 kilometers from Jalapa;
and (4) in Guatemala city, the capital of the Department of
Guatemala, which has a population that is 91% urban.6 We
initially aimed to investigate the city of Jalapa, which is the city
closest to the Xalap´an region; however, the World Bank11,12
lacked data on the city of Jalapa. Therefore, we chose to estimate
emissions in the city of Jutiapa, as it is close in population size
and location to Jalapa.

Methods
2.1
Working groups, questionnaire, and data collection
We conducted a 10-week working group session to discuss solid
alternatives to burning plastic waste in one rural indigenous
community in the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala. This
region lacks access to formal municipal or private waste
collection programs. One community was chosen based on
accessibility to public transportation, the presence of a large
meeting space to conduct weekly activities, and the community
leadership committee's approval of the study. All accessible
households were visited and asked if they would be interested in
participating in any combination of the following three activi-
ties: (1) in-home participatory observation of plastic waste
disposal; (2) a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP)
survey;35 and (3) a 10-week working group session to discuss
alternatives to burning plastic. The working group session was
conducted in Spanish and met weekly between June and August
2019. Eighty-seven participants (5 male; 82 female) attended the
sessions, which included topics on recycling plastic waste, the
adverse eﬀects of plastics on the environment and human
health, and how to reduce, reuse, and repurpose plastic waste to
improve solid waste management. A sociodemographic ques-
tionnaire (see Table S1†) was verbally administered to partici-
pants from 50 households who attended the rst or second
working group sessions. These participants were also provided
with burlap bags and asked to collect all plastics that they would
have normally burned in an indoor or outdoor re in the bag for
a week. The mass of plastic waste generated per household was
weighed, recorded, and taken to the local dump or recycled
weekly by our project staﬀ. Each participant collected house-
hold plastic waste over a four-week period. The study protocol
and informed consent were approved by the Institutional
Review Boards (IRB) at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala
and Emory University. Written informed consent was obtained
from study participants who participated in the sociodemo-
graphic questionnaire and the collection of plastic waste.

Calculating emissions
To quantify emissions from the domestic burning of plastic
waste for 62 chemical species in the Xalap´an region, we used
a Monte Carlo sampling methodology.36,37 The emission factors
(EFs) that were used to calculate emissions are taken from the

(NAMaSTE), which took place in 2014, and EF values were
measured from burns containing plastics as waste.16,28
An EF is a value that contains the unit of mass of a pollutant
released into the air per kilogram of the fuel that is burned.16
Limited data were available for emission factors (EFs) from
waste burning of specically plastics in traditional stoves.
Several studies have measured EFs from waste burns. However,
these EFs were either measured from mixed waste burns or fuel-
based burns that contained separate, specic kinds of plastic
waste (i.e., plastic packaging versus plastic foam), rather than
exclusively plastic waste burns.38–41 The NAMaSTE study is
unique in that it measures EF values from homogeneous plastic
waste burning that this paper focuses on. Although burning
conditions in Nepal and Guatemala would diﬀer, studies
measuring EFs from plastic waste burns and conducted in
Guatemala were not found. The NAMaSTE study obtained data
that most closely t our purposes of estimating emissions from
domestic plastic waste burning res. We used the NAMaSTE's
EF values from re 16 and plastic burns 1 and 2 (the plastic
waste burns)42,43 because of the lack of studies measuring EFs
for plastic waste burning in Guatemala and NAMaSTE's location
in the Global South.
We also quantied the contributions of plastic burning to
total emissions, using the data from the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v5.0), which did not
include open domestic burning in their estimates.16,17,32–34 First,
we created a normal distribution for the mass of plastic waste
burned per capita per year, based on the plastic trash data we
collected in the eld over a month (see Fig. S2†). Second, we
created a normal distribution for an EF for each of the 62
chemical species. Then, we conducted one million Monte Carlo
samplings, selecting one value for the mass of plastic burned
and the other for the EF from the two distributions and multi-
plied them. This methodology was used to calculate emissions
due to the uncertainty associated with the mass and the EF
estimates used. The histogram distributions that resulted from
running a Monte Carlo simulation indicate the range and
probability of possible results for the emission estimates based
on this uncertainty. We used the following equation to nd the
distribution of emissions for each species:
Ei = M × EFi
44
Ei – emissions of air pollutant i [g per year]. M – mass of plastic
burned [kg per year]. EFi – emission factor of air pollutant i [g
per kg plastic burned].
To quantify emissions for each of the departments in Gua-
temala, we rst estimated the mass of plastic burned, using the
most recent Guatemalan 2018 census data6 on population, the
number of households, and the number of households that
burn waste. We rst distributed the average total mass of plastic
waste generated annually per capita in Guatemala, using the
results from our study (12.2 ± 5.8 kg per capita per year) for
a lower boundary estimate and the World Bank value (29.3 kg
per capita per year) for an upper boundary estimate.11,12 The
main cities where data were collected by the World Bank were
Guatemala city, Antigua, and Jutiapa, which are higher-income
areas located in departments with lower poverty rates than
Jalapa, where Xalap´an is located (see Table S2†).6,11,45 Therefore,
lower and upper boundary estimates were used to account for
the varying income levels of the locations where data were
collected, which could aﬀect the estimated per capita waste
generation estimate.46–52 To simplify calculations and allow for
regression analysis between waste generation per department
and socioeconomic and demographic factors in our study, each
mass estimate was distributed among the 22 departments in
Guatemala according to the population in each department.
Individual- or household-level data were not provided by the
World Bank to determine the deviation in per capita plastic
waste generation. Therefore, the singular value of 29.3 kg per
capita per year, rather than a normal distribution, was used for
distributing plastic waste generation by the department. We
then quantied the mass of plastic burned based on the ratio of
households that burn waste in each of the departments, using
the census data. Based on this method, the total estimated
plastic burned for the population in Guatemala was 80.2 Gg per
year for the lower boundary estimate and 193 Gg per year for the
upper boundary estimate. Finally, using the estimated mass of
plastic burned per department and the EF distribution based on
the mean and standard deviation, we created the emission
estimates for each department for the 62 chemical species. The
estimated per capita emissions were compared among the 22
departments in Guatemala. We also multiplied emissions by
the departmental population and summed the results to
determine the total annual national emissions from burning
plastics for PM2.5, BC, OC, CO, and CO2.
For the city-level estimates, we used the World Bank data on
the mass of total waste generated per capita per day and the
percent of total waste that is plastic for Guatemala as a whole, as
the World Bank lacked city-specic data for per capita waste
generation and plastic waste percent composition. We also used
the waste collection rate for Guatemala city (87.5%) and Jutiapa
(28.0%), separately.11,12 There is no data for Jalapa, so we used
the city of Jutiapa as a proxy for Jalapa. We chose Jutiapa
because it is the most proximate city (55 km distance) of
a similar size to Jalapa, as Jutiapa had a population of 145 880
and Jalapa had a population of 159 840 in 2018.6 The diﬀerence
in waste collection rates in diﬀerent locations exemplies the
lack of access to waste collection services in more rural areas,
such as Jutiapa, as compared to more urban areas like Guate-
mala city. The rate of waste not collected, provided by the World
Bank,11,12 was assumed to be burned in order to provide
maximum emission estimates from plastic waste burned.

Data analysis
All the data analyses and descriptive statistics, including
means, standard deviations, and correlations, as well as
signicance tests (i.e., t-test and ANOVA) were conducted using
R version 4.0.2.53 Signicance tests were used to determine
whether education and wealth, measured by cell phone, radio,
and color television ownership and internet access, signicantly
aﬀected the amount of waste generated by the participants. The

Results and discussion
3.1
Demographic information
All respondents to the Xalap´an region survey were females, with
an average age of 36 ± 11 years, and the median number of
people living in each participant's household was six people (see
Table 1). Only one participant was studying and had completed
13 years of formal education at the time of our study. The
highest level of education completed by most of the participants
was incomplete primary education (46%), demonstrating low
levels of education received by most of these rural female
participants. Most (88%) of the participants did not work
outside of the home. The most common stove used for cooking
in Jalapa was a poyet´on (52%), which is an elevated open re
stove without a chimney and, in terms of pollution, is similar to
an open re stove. Women were in charge of cooking and waste
disposal, which included domestic burning of plastic waste or
other materials. As a result, they are more prone to harmful air
pollutant exposure. Decreasing plastic waste from household
burning and cooking could thus reduce exposure to pollution
and adverse health-related eﬀects of this exposure.
3.2
Plastic waste generation in the Xalap´an region of Jalapa,
Guatemala
The average weight of plastic waste generated per household for
weeks 1 through 4 in the study was 1.31 ± 0.66 kg, 1.12 ± 0.91
kg, 0.92 ± 0.70 kg, and 0.99 ± 0.77 kg, respectively. The average
amount of plastic waste generated by the participants in
Xalap´an over the four-week period was 3.34 × 10−2 ± 1.58 ×
10−2 kg per person per day (see Table S3†).
We conducted hypothesis tests to determine: (1) whether the

ownership of assets (cell phone, radio, color television,
computer, internet access) and level of education had a statis-
tically signicant impact on the mass of domestic plastic waste
generated. Since the distribution of the total mass of plastic
waste generated per household was slightly right skewed, the
variable for the mass of plastic waste generated per household
was log-transformed when conducting the signicance tests.
There was an overall decrease in the average amount of
plastic waste generated per household over time (Fig. 1). The
decrease in plastic generation was signicant when comparing
the plastic waste generation of week 1 to week 2 (two-tailed two-
sample t-test, p = 0.07), week 3 (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p =
0.001), and to week 4 (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.007;
see Table S4†). These results suggest that the workshops and
trainings conducted during the study could have contributed to
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
plastic
waste
generated
throughout the course of the study. There was a very slight
increase in the mass of waste generated from week 3 to week 4;
however, this diﬀerence was insignicant (two-tailed two-
sample t-test, p = 0.51). This result could be a preliminary
indication of a plateau point for the extent of the eﬀect of the
workshops on the average mass of plastic waste generated.
However, the participants did see this study as an opportunity
to dispose of items that are not easily disposable and that they
had not been able to dispose of due to a lack of access to formal
waste collection. So the rst measurements were more likely to
contain more larger plastic items, such as broken plastic chairs
or toys. Therefore, the decrease in the mass of plastic waste
generated over the four weeks could be aﬀected by a decrease in
large-mass plastic items being brought for measurement and
disposal. There was not a signicant correlation between the
number of persons living in a household and the weight of
plastic waste generated (r = −0.08, p = 0.58). This result
suggests that other factors may better explain the diﬀerence in
the amount of waste produced by each household.
As shown in Table 2, no signicant relationship was
observed between the amount of plastic waste generated and
education level (F = 0.35). Those who owned a cell phone
generated more waste overall, but the diﬀerence in waste
generation between cell phone owners and non-owners was not
signicant (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.62). Those who
owned a radio generated more waste overall, but the diﬀerence
between radio ownership and non-ownership was insignicant
as well (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.50). The relationships
between the amount of plastic generated and: (1) color televi-
sion ownership (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.05) and (2)
internet access (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.07) were
found to be statistically signicant. Those with a color television
or internet access generated signicantly less plastic waste than
those without a color television or without internet access. This
relationship between television or internet access and the mass
of plastic waste generated may result from both variables being
indicative of higher income households that are more likely to
aﬀord durable items. The purchase and use of cheaper,
disposable, and single-use plastic items is more likely in lower
income households that cannot aﬀord higher quality items.
These diﬀerences would thus contribute to higher amounts of
plastic waste being produced in lower income households. Our
results can be compared to a previous study that found that
non-biodegradable,
including
plastic,
waste
generation
decreases from low income to lower middle-income groups,
although this waste generation then increases for middle,
upper-middle, and highest income groups.54 Other studies have
found organic or total solid waste generation to be positively
correlated with the household income level,46,47,49–52 suggesting

waste type depend on the income level.
Income data are needed to determine the factors that are
indicators of wealth in the rural community of Xalap´an, Gua-
temala, so we can test whether the correlation found with color
television and internet access is related to wealth. In this study
we chose not to ask working group participants about their
household income levels as this would have been perceived as
invasive.

Plastic waste burning emission estimates
The estimated emissions for PM2.5 and CO2 in the Xalap´an
region are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the Xalap´an survey, 84% of
households indicated that they burned their waste as their
primary mode of waste disposal (see Table S3†). Among the
people whose primary mode of disposal is burning, the quan-
tied average amount of plastic waste that would have been
burned per person per day was 2.66 × 10−2 ± 1.32 × 10−2 kg
(see Table S3†) based on the waste collected. Comparing this
with the total mass of plastic waste collected, it was found that
approximately 80% of the mass of plastic waste generated came
from households that use waste burning as their primary mode
of waste disposal (see Table S3†). This percentage (80%)
compares well with the percentage of households that burn
waste as their primary mode of waste disposal in Xalap´an (84%).
These results indicate that the percentage of households that
primarily disposes of waste through burning could be used as
a proxy for calculating the mass of plastic waste burned. We
thus used this value to estimate the average mass of plastic
burned in each department in Guatemala.
The lower and upper boundary estimated mass of plastic
waste burned at the department level in Guatemala based on
the 2018 Guatemalan census data are shown in Table S2.† There
is a large range from 0.645 kg per person per year to 61.4 kg per
person per year, depending on the location. One reason for this
range is likely the diﬀerence in access to private or municipal
waste collection services in urban versus rural areas within each
department. There is a moderate positive correlation between
the percentage of the population in each department that is
rural, and the average mass of plastic waste burned per capita
per year (Fig. 3). A simple linear regression model between these
variables has an R2 value of about 0.63, which suggests that
about 63% of the variance in the average mass of plastic waste
burned domestically can be explained by the size of the rural
population.
The estimated average mass of plastic waste burned based
on the Guatemalan census data was higher in the Department
of Jutiapa (7.44 ± 3.52 kg per capita per year lower bound
estimate; 17.9 kg per capita per year upper bound estimate)
than in the Department of Jalapa (6.04 ± 2.86 kg per capita per

bound estimate) and the Department of Guatemala (1.26 ±
0.594 kg per capita per year lower bound estimate; 3.02 kg per
capita per year upper bound estimate). The mass of plastic
waste generated in the cities of Guatemala city and Jutiapa was
28.1 kg per capita per year and 15.4 kg per capita per year,
respectively (see Table S5†). The percent of plastic waste
assumed to be burned in Jutiapa (87.5%) was notably higher
than that of Guatemala city (28.0%). Although the per capita
plastic waste generation in Guatemala city is about two times
that of Jutiapa, a lower mass of plastic waste is domestically
burned in Guatemala city (7.87 kg per year), as compared to
Jutiapa (13.5 kg per year). This diﬀerence in the waste collection
rate, and thus assumed domestic waste burning rate, highlights
the lack of access to waste collection services in more rural
areas, even cities with a population over 100 000, such as Jutiapa
and Jalapa, compared to Guatemala city. Using this estimated
mass of plastic waste burned, we calculated emission estimates
for the 62 species at the department level in Guatemala using
both methods (see Tables S6 and S7†). Maps of the distribution
of emissions of six pollutants in 22 departments are shown in
Fig. 4.
EDGAR v5.0 currently does not include emissions from the
domestic burning of plastic waste. Our results show that
including plastic waste burning in the EDGAR v5.0 emissions
inventory could increase national emission estimates by
between 6.71 × 106 ± 3.37 × 106 kg per year (5.62 ± 2.82%;
lower boundary estimate) and 1.61 × 107 ± 2.46 × 106 kg per
year (13.5 ± 2.06%; upper boundary estimate) for PM2.5 and by
between 2.07 × 108 ± 9.90 × 107 kg per year (0.564 ± 0.369%;
lower boundary estimate) and (4.99 × 108 ± 3.03 × 107) (1.36 ±
8.25 × 10−2%; upper boundary estimate) for CO2 (see Table 3).
Table 3 also summarizes the estimated total emissions and
percent increases in national emissions for BC, OC, and CO
emissions, if domestic burning of plastic waste was included in
the EDGAR v5.0 (ref. 32–34) emission inventory.
Estimated emissions from the domestic burning of plastic
waste ranged from 2.63 × 104 ± 1.32 × 104 kg per year for PM2.5
and 8.11 × 105 ± 3.87 × 105 kg per year for CO2 in the
Department of Sacatep´equez to 8.46 × 105 ± 4.25 × 105 kg per
year for PM2.5 and 2.61 × 107 ± 1.25 × 107 kg per year for CO2 in
the Department of Alta Verapaz for the lower boundary estimate
(see Table S8†). For the upper boundary estimate, they ranged
from 6.33 × 104 ± 9.64 × 103 kg per year for PM2.5 and 1.96 ×
106 ± 1.19 × 105 kg per year for CO2 in the Department of
Sacatep´equez to 2.03 × 106 ± 3.10 × 105 kg per year for PM2.5
and 6.28 × 107 ± 3.82 × 106 kg per year for CO2 in the
Department of Alta Verapaz (see Table S9†). Most of the pop-
ulation in Alta Verapaz (68.7%) lives in rural areas (see Table
S2†), which may contribute to a lack of access to nearby waste
disposal services, leading to high emissions from plastic
burning in the department. According to the Instituto Nacional
de Estad´ıstica Guatemala (INE; National Statistics Institute of
Guatemala),55 the Department of Alta Verapaz had the highest
poverty rate in the country in 2014, with 83.1% of its population
experiencing poverty (see Table S2†). The socioeconomic status
of the Department of Alta Verapaz may contribute to a lack of
monetary resources for establishing formal waste disposal
programs. The Department of Alta Verapaz, similar to Xalap´an,
also has a high indigenous population, with 93.2% of its pop-
ulation being indigenous (see Table S2†). Therefore, a similar
reduction strategy might be helpful for the regions of Xalap´an
and Alta Verapaz. Providing access to information and educa-
tion about the benets of waste reduction and the risks of waste
burning to human health and the environment were possible
strategies in Xalap´an that could be useful in Alta Verapaz. More
importantly, however, increasing nancial resources for waste
disposal and establishing local waste disposal infrastructure
would help decrease waste burning as a method of disposal and
reduce GHG and air pollutant emissions in these areas. The
information presented in this study may be useful in deter-
mining the extent and types of interventions that should take
place to improve waste collection infrastructure and thus
reduce plastic waste generation in other similar communities.

Conclusions
Our results show that including emissions from the domestic
burning of plastic waste in emission inventories could result in
notable increases in emission estimates, including 7.23 ± 3.58
to 17.4 ± 2.3% for OC, 5.70 ± 2.77 to 13.7 ± 1.38% for BC, 5.62 ±
2.82 to 13.5 ± 2.06% for PM2.5, and 0.564 ± 0.369 to 1.36 ± 8.25
× 10−2% for CO2, and 0.154 ± 0.157 to 0.371 ± 0.303% for CO
(see Table 3). Furthermore, providing access to proper waste
disposal programs in low-resource countries, especially in rural
areas, could mitigate the amount of waste burned domestically
and thus reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution from this
source.
Limitations of this study include a small sample size and
a short length of the data collection period for the mass of waste
generated by the participants in the Xalap´an survey. A larger
sample of households and a longer period of data collection
would provide a more reliable estimate of the average mass of
plastic waste generated and burned. Data on the mass of plastic
waste generated by each household before the workshops were
also not collected and introduced a limitation for estimating
emissions. More data are needed regarding emissions from
domestic burning of plastic waste both before and aer any
waste reduction intervention from the workshops to provide
a baseline for comparison and to assess the eﬃcacy of the
intervention. Future studies may also improve upon this study's
data collection by gathering information on corresponding
household income levels and fuel types used in order to deter-
mine whether or how these factors would aﬀect plastic waste
generation and emissions released when burning.
Another limitation is that the EFs used to calculate emis-
sions in our study were not local to Guatemala due to a lack of
studies quantifying EFs from homogeneous plastic waste
burning. More data on EFs from plastic waste burning in Gua-
temala are needed to provide more accurate local estimates.
Collecting data on the division of the mass of plastic waste
burned outdoors versus indoors would also help address this
uncertainty. The current lack of data on the mass of plastic
waste disposed of through domestic burning is also a limitation

on the assumption that any waste that was not collected by
private or municipal waste collection service was burned, even
though other forms of plastic waste disposal, such as burial or
dumping in public spaces, including in bodies of water, are also
used when no formal waste collection infrastructure is avail-
able. This aspect of the calculations may have resulted in an
overestimation of emissions at the city level. Future research
would benet from direct measurements of the mass of plastic
waste burned domestically to provide more accurate estimates
of emissions that come from the domestic burning of plastic
waste.
Despite these limitations, our research has taken the rst
steps towards providing emission estimates from domestic
burning of plastic waste in Guatemala. Domestic burning of
plastic waste results in signicant emissions; lowering these
emissions by improving waste collection, particularly in low-
income countries and rural areas, will be important for
improving air quality, mitigating climate change, and reducing
adverse human health impacts.

"Emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon compounds from combustion of crop residue was investigated.
Crop residues comprising maize cobs, maize husks, rice husks and bean chaff were burnt in a furnace at a tem-
perature of 400 C and the emissions from the combustion process were characterized using standard methods.
Health risk through inhalation was assessed using toxic equivalent factors and excess lifetime cancer risk. The
results showed the detection of 16 PAH compound which included: Benzo[ghi]perylene, Naphthalene, Ace-
naphthene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, Fluorene, Fluoranthene, Acenaphthylene, Pyrene, Benzo[a]anthracene,
Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene, Chrysene, Benzo[a]pyrene, Indene[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and Benzo
[k]ﬂuoranthene. Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene had highest mean concentration of 1.30 μg/mg while Dibenzo[a,h]
anthracene had the lowest mean concentration of 0.01 μg/mg. It was also revealed that the toxicity of PAHs was
due to the presence of Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene for all the samples except for sample 4 for which the main
contribution to toxicity was emission from benzo(a)pyrene, while the cancer risk assessment estimated to be 1.2 
101 was far above the acceptable carcinogenic risk limit of 1  106. This study concluded that, more efforts are
needed to reduce emission of PAHs from the combustion of crop residues into the ambient air otherwise, human
health could be under threat especially if exposed for a long period.

Villagers residing in areas with rice farms are exposed to smoke from burning of agricultural waste that
may affect respiratory health. To assess respiratory effects of this smoke-induced air pollution, a cross-
sectional study has been conducted in three randomly selected villages of Isfahan rural areas. A physician-
administered health questionnaire was completed for 433 male and 561 female villagers aged 1–80 years,
followed by physical examinations and spirometry in symptomatic cases, before and after a rice burning
episode in October 2000. Total particulate and respirable particulate maters (PM10) was doubled during
burning episode. Prevalence rates for respiratory symptoms before smoke were: recent asthma attacks
(7.7%), using asthma medications (3%), sleep disturbed by dyspnea and cough (7.4%), exercise-induced
cough (13.3%), which increased to 9.5, 7.1, 9.3 and 17%, respectively. Mean initial values (as percent of
prediction) for; FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, and FEF25–75 were: 85.9 ± 22.7, 81.7 ±8, 86.2 ±26.2 and
60 ± 26.4, respectively. The mentioned values decreased to to 83.2 ± 19.5, 76.5 ± 10.3, 85.5 ± 21.1 and
54.3 ± 26.4, respectively. All of the clinical and spirometric changes were statistically significant. Study
findings suggest increased respiratory morbidity associated with rice burning episodes among all people
living in the area.
Keywords: Air-pollution; rice; farm; burning; burn; respiratory; symptom; respiratory-health.
Introduction
Acute smoke inhalation as a result of fires is a major problem in urban areas (American
Academy of Pediatrics 2000) and has been well studied during the last two decades. Acute
exposure to heat, particulate matter (soot), and gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen
cyanide can result in respiratory tract burning, asphyxia, and poisoning (Haponic 1993). Chronic
exposure to air pollution, especially in larger cities, which is usually related to the internal
combustion engine (Steerenberg et al. 2001) is also known, and its deleterious effects on the
tracheobronchial tree and resultant disorders have been frequently studied all over the world.
Severe structural and functional impairments both in the upper (Caldern-Garcidueas et al. 2001)
and lower (Tzankis et al. 2001) respiratory tract are recorded in those exposed to air pollution.126
Golshan et al.
Both short-term (Schindler et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2000), and long-term (Mukae et al. 2001;
Pauwels et al. 2001) exposures can induce clinical and/or functional respiratory impairments.
However, subacute smoke inhalation, which usually happens to those living in the neighborhood
of fires, not close enough to be grossly injured, have been seldom discussed (McCurdy et al.
1996; Jacobs et al. 1997; Long et al. 1998).
Every October in Isfahan after harvesting the rice farms, farmers burn the rice residues (straw
and stubble) to prevent the growth of insect larvae. The serial burning in the area lasts for a few
weeks. At these times, a thick cloud of smoke covers the fields and households of a large area
in the villages, close to Isfahan suburbs, which potentially can injure the respiratory tract of the
healthy inhabitants, and more obviously aggravate the pre-existing respiratory disorders.
The purpose of this study is to compare the respiratory health status of the inhabitants of the
villages of the rice farms before and after burning the rice residues, to elucidate the possible
respiratory risk of this kind of sub-acute smoke inhalation.
Subjects and methods
The Committee for Medical Ethics at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the
protocols and methods.
Assuming a 5% prevalence rate of airways diseases in the population, 680 people residing in
the area were estimated to be sufficient for the study. Three of the 78 villages found in the map
of the area were randomly selected for the study. All people living in these three villages were
considered to be enrolled in the study. When these three villages were visited, the actual total
population was 1,127 individuals who were all included in the group.
A four-step approach was used for the survey. For the first step, four interns of Isfahan
Medical School attended the villages, visited all houses, and asked all people living in the
houses to come to local public health office for a free medical interview and physical
examinations. Since many of the family members may not have been home at first visit, they
repeated the visits on several occasions and at different times to see all members. The medical
interview and physical examinations were performed by interns. To make uniform interviews
and medical recordings the interns used a popular respiratory questionnaire (Fishman et al.
1998) as the backbone of the interview.
For the second step, those participants complaining of respiratory symptoms, and/or having
evidence of airway diseases other than recent colds, were referred to the pulmonary clinic of St.
Zahra Medical Center for a free visit with a pulmonolgist and a routine spirometry if the subject
was co-operative enough to perform the standard maneuvers. At this second stage, 134 subjects
were invited.
Spirometric parameters that were recorded for comparisons included: forced vital capacity
(FVC), forced expiratory flow in the first second of expiration (FEV1), the ratio of FVC/FEV1,
peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and mean expiratory flow rate at middle half of expiration
(FEF 25–75).
One hundred and six cases completed the second stage. The response rate for the second stage
was 79%.
Steps one and two were completed during August and September 2000.
The amount of air-suspended particulate maters (PM10) in 14 randomly selected outdoor loci
in the area were measured, both before and a few weeks later, during the active phase of burning
process. PM10 dust measurements were performed using Teflon filters of 37 mm diameter and
1 mm pore size, and three pieces cassette holder connected to a personal sampling pump (SKC,Respiratory effects of farm burning
127
model 224-PXR3) operating at a flow rate of 1.5 l/min. Respirable dust samples were collected
using a 10-mm Dorr-olive cyclone on series with 37-mm Teflon filters and the above pump at
a flow rate of 1.7 l/min. The mass of dust in all samples was determined gravimetrically.
One week after completion of the latest burns, all of the procedures of the first two steps were
repeated to complete the study.
In the fourth step, all of the stage two cases and also newly symptomatic persons were invited
for interview and spirometry. However, pulmonary function test or auscultation comparisons were
applicable only in those with a set of two spirometries and/or two physical examinations.
Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in one patient with cough and hemoptysis
after a burn episode, which showed a mild increase in cell population of the lavage fluid with
26% lymphocytes and 8% neutrophils.
The findings were collected in a database and analyzed by the statistical package for the social
sciences (SPSS for Windows, ver 10.05, SPSS Chicago, IL). Dependent samples t-test was used
to compare nominal or categorical variables. Numerical variables were compared using compare
means of the package.
Multivariate analysis was used to determine the association of post-pollution symptoms with
previous histories of respiratory illnesses and also air pollution.
Results
Of the initially invited 1,127 inhabitants of the area, 994 (88.2%) accepted enrolment in the
study. The major reason for refusal was having no time to come to the clinic.
The final subjects who successfully completed the first stage of the study comprised 561
female and 
433 
male 
subjects, 
ranging 
in 
age 
from 
1month 
to 
80 
years
(Mean ± SD = 25.2 ± 17.5). The data available from the initial, phase one interview suggested
that a higher proportion of non-responders (n = 105/133) were male. Response rates for male and
females in first phase were 80.5 and 95.2%, respectively.
In the second stage, the 28 non-responders were generally less symptomatic (as judged by the
initial phase one interview) than were responders. For example, the prevalence of wheeze or
whistle in the chest in the last 12 months was 11.3% in the non-responders in comparison with
42.3% in the responders (P < 0.0001).

The response rates for stages 3 and 4 were 87.8 and 79%, respectively, which are close to the
first two stages.
The study population, according to demographic factors, smoking status and number of
subjects satisfactorily completing pulmonary function testing, is presented in Table 1.
Nearly all of the women were housewives also involved in farm jobs, with 10 teachers, three
hairdressers, and four tailors in the group.
Most of the men were farmers; however, many of them were also involved in small industrial
and/or clerical jobs and office services in the area. Unfortunately many of the recorded men’s
extra job titles were poorly defined and could not disclose the possible pulmonary risks. So they
were not used for risk estimations.
The frequency of respiratory disorders and related symptoms in stages 1 and 2, and changes
observed after burning of the residues (stages 3 and 4) are summarized in Table 2.
In the second stage, only 79 of the 134 invited cases (58.9%) underwent pulmonary function
testing, others (mostly young children) were unable to perform satisfactory forced vital capacity

analyzable data were collected.
The main parameters of spirometric recordings of the 79 cases (Mean ±SD) before and after
burning the residues are summarized in Table 3.
Most of the new sufferers of dyspneal attacks, and night dyspnea and/or cough, as recorded
in stages 3 and 4 of the study, had previous histories of similar conditions; however, two toddlers
experienced wheezy respiratory illness for the first time in life in these smoke exposure days.
In multivariate analysis, recent wheezy dyspneal attacks and night sleep disturbance due to
respiratory symptoms after burning episode were significantly associated with previous histories
of: cigarette smoking (P < 0.01), chronic bronchitis (P < 0.05), asthma (P = 0.007) or related
symptoms (P < 0.01–0.001).
The results of particulate matter (PM10) measurements are included in Table 4.
Discussion
Smoke inhalation is an important cause of acute lung injury in humans and is associated with
a high mortality rate (Laffon et al. 1999). Smoke inhalation affects both pulmonary endothelial
and epithelial barriers (Laffon et al. 1999).
A large number of the lower-molecular weight constituents of smoke are toxic to the
bronchial mucosa and alveoli because of their physical and/or chemical properties, or their
ability to form free radicals. Examples include ammonia, aldehydes, chlorine, hydrogen
chloride, SO2, NO, NO2, phosgene and many other known or even unknown agents (Haponic
et al. 1988). The smoke constituents when inhaled in sufficient concentrations tend to produce
acute neutrophilic airway inflammation associated with symptoms consisting of cough,
bronchorrhea, dyspnea and wheezing (Laffon et al. 1999), the symptoms may appear early or
with a significant delay after exposure (Haponic et al. 1988). Increased alveolo-capillary
permeability, impaired lymphatic flow (Laffon et al. 1999), and pulmonary edema may also
ensue after heavy exposures (Soejima et al. 2001).
However, repeated exposures to lower concentrations of smoke may not induce acute injuries
and can contribute to development of chronic respiratory illnesses including asthma (Kinsella et
al. 1991), chronic bronchitis and COPD (Pauwels et al. 2001).
Subacute smoke inhalation with borderline concentrations can result in both; acute respiratory
derangement and prepare the victims to develop chronic respiratory illness. In a previous survey
in Canada, deleterious effects of smoke arising from burning agricultural residues had been
observed on aggravation of previous respiratory symptoms of patients suffering COPD (Long et
al. 1998). However, they did not elucidate the possible effects on respiratory health of
asymptomatic inhabitants in the area.

In the present study, randomly selected people were enrolled and classic medical interviews
were carried out, from which the responses to respiratory questions were extracted and the
involved interns completed the questionnaires in all stages. Therefore, the answers recorded in
the questionnaires are more likely to represent the facts.
As seen in Tables 2 and 3, significant increases both in the number of symptomatic cases and
the severity of the previous disorders, as reflected in reduced FEV1 and FEF25–75 of the
symptomatic cases, can be observed. These data confirm that exposure to smoke produced by
burning agricultural residues induces pulmonary symptoms in previously asymptomatic
inhabitants, possibly due to acute inflammation of airways, and also can aggravate previous
symptoms in susceptible patients. The latter finding looks more obvious, since symptomatic
individuals are more likely to seek medical assistance, but late morbidities associated with
repeating exposures of uncomplaining persons to such contaminated air have been frequently
reported (Long et al. 1998; Dow et al. 1999; Gold et al. 2000), and should be of concern for
communities and physicians, especially in developing countries.
Significant increases in suspended particulate maters (PM10) were recorded in the ambient air
in the area during the burning episode (Table 2), which seems to be responsible for the observed
pulmonary symptoms.
The findings of the present study are in accord with previous reports on the deleterious
pulmonary effects of smoke induced by burning of agricultural residues or biomass fuels used
in developing countries (Bruce et al. 2000; Gold et al. 2000).
A recent study has established that the burning agricultural or forest residues can expose local
communities to relatively high levels of pollutants (Reinhardt et al. 2001).This high level of air
pollution does not remain local and confined to nearby areas; it can affect places many
kilometers away from the burning sources (Lelieveld et al. 2001).
There is evidence confirming that prolonged subacute exposure to biomass smoke can induce
chronic pulmonary parenchymal (Amoli 1998; gold et al. 2000), and/or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (Bruce et al. 2000).
Conclusions
Air pollution associated with the burning of agricultural residues is capable of aggravating pre-
existing dyspnea, cough, night cough, night chest discomfort and exercise-induced cough in
patients with chronic respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, smoke exposure can induce all of the
above-mentioned symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects. Also, obstructive spirometric
patterns are more often recorded after smoke exposure.

Open dumping and burning of solid waste are widely practiced in underserved communities lacking access
to solid waste management facilities; however, the generation of microplastics from these sites has been
overlooked. We report elevated concentrations of microplastics (MPs) in soil of three solid waste open
dump and burn sites: a single-family site in Tuttle, Oklahoma, USA, and two community-wide sites in
Crow Agency and Lodge Grass, Montana, USA. We extracted, quantiﬁed, and characterized MPs from
two soil depths (0–9 cm and 9–18 cm). The average of abundance of particles found at community-
wide sites three sites (18, 460 particles kg−1 soil) equals or exceeds reported concentrations from
currently understood sources of MPs including biosolids application and other agricultural practices.
Attenuated total reﬂectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) identiﬁed polyethylene as the
dominant polymer across all sites (46.2–84.8%). We also detected rayon (#11.5%), polystyrene (up to
11.5%), polyethylene terephthalate (#5.1), polyvinyl chloride (#4.4%), polyester (#3.1), and acrylic (#2.2%).
Burned MPs accounted for 76.3 to 96.9% of the MPs found in both community wide dumping sites.
These results indicate that solid waste dumping and burning activities are a major source of thermally
oxidized MPs for the surrounding terrestrial environment with potential to negatively aﬀect underserved
communities.
Environmental signicance
Our work determined the quantity and vertical distribution of microplastics (MPs) in soil surrounding open dumping and burning sites. This work unveils the
abundance of MPs in the terrestrial environment around open dumpling and open burning sites near underserved communities. Generation of MPs through
open dumping and burning of solid waste is an issue concerning not only our partner communities for this study in Oklahoma and Montana, but also globally,
and has profound environmental implications for rural and urban underserved communities worldwide.

Introduction
Human activities generated about 242 million metric tons of
solid waste in 2016 according to the World Bank.1 Plastic waste
represents about 12.2% of the solid waste of the United States of
America (US)2 and 12% around the world.1 In the specic case of
the US, such estimation disregards rubber or synthetic polymer
based textiles as part of the plastic waste as these wastes are
grouped under the rubber, leather, and textiles category.2
Waste disposal practices are a function of each country's
economy.1,3 In high income countries, most of the waste is
either landlled (39% of the total waste), recycled (29%), or
incinerated (22%). Low income countries, on the other hand,
dispose about 93% of their waste in open dump sites.1 Open

ties even in upper middle- and high-income countries.
In the US, some rural communities and isolated Native
American Tribes lack access to waste collection services and
management facilities and, as a result, rely upon open burning
to dispose of solid waste.3,4 About 18–29 million metric tons of
plastic waste was burned in 2016.3,5 Though burning solid waste
disposed in open pits may reduce waste volume, pathogen
exposure,3 and undesirable odor, the sites lack protective
barriers and result in refuse placed directly above the ground.6
Open dumping and burning of solid waste are well-known
sources of suspended particulate matter, odorous compounds,
and leachates among other pollutants.3,7
Open dumping and burning sites are also an unexplored
source of terrestrial microplastics (MPs, plastic pieces with
a size between 1 mm and 5 mm.8 It is likely that open burning
sites generate MPs due to the lack of temperatures that are
suﬃcient or consistent enough to incinerate plastic waste,
which represents between 6.4 and 13% of the solid waste.1
Partially-combusted plastics generated from these burning
processes have more potential to generate MPs relative to non-
oxidized plastics. Other types of oxidized MPs (e.g., UV oxidized)
have shown increased toxicity,9 sorption capacity,10,11 brittle-
ness,12 and leaching capacity of additives13–15 among other
eﬀects. This highlights the importance of considering not only
MP quantity and plastic type, but also the MP functional and
surface chemistry.16,17
Compared to aquatic ecosystems, the current understanding
of sources and levels of MP pollution in terrestrial ecosystems is
limited.18–21 Common sources of MPs in soils include improper
disposal of domestic and industrial waste, urban and rural
runoﬀ, wet and dry deposition, and biosolids.22,23 However, even
less research has been conducted to understand the abundance
and type of MPs in soils due to open dumping and burning of
solid waste, which is a common waste disposal practice in
underserved rural communities.1,3,24–27 Thus far, these few
studies agree on microplastic occurrence28,29 in a range of 50 to
1110 items kg−1.30
Our work determined the abundance and vertical distribu-
tion of MPs in soil surrounding open dumping and burning
sites at a single-family open burning site located in Tuttle,
Oklahoma
(Tuttle
burn
site),
and
two
Native
American
community-wide sites in Crow Agency, Montana (Crow Agency
burn site and Lodge Grass dump site). We identied the poly-
mer type and functional chemistry of MPs and trends in MPs
abundance, polymer size, and surface chemistry in relation to
soil physiochemical characteristics, depth, and site history and
use. Few studies have examined the occurrence of MPs in waste
disposal sites, and even fewer have considered the surrounding
soils.3,4,27–30 Microplastics generated from open burning sites
likely show diﬀerent oxidation patterns than other MPs found
in the environment that have been generated from other
weathering processes. Our study assesses the abundance of MPs
near open dumping and open burning sites in underserved
communities and analyzes the functional chemistry of MPs
with a thermal oxidation signature; and it highlights the
importance of understanding MP contamination aﬀecting
underserved communities which are frequently overlooked in
mainstream science.

Methods
2.1
Quality assurance and quality control
To reduce MP contamination during laboratory procedures, all
glassware was sonicated for 30 min in deionized (DI) water and
covered with aluminum foil until use. All procedures except for
elutriation and uorescence microscopy were conducted in
a designated MP laboratory which had extra air ltration units
and regular rigorous cleaning of surfaces. All applicable
procedures were conducted in a laminar ow fume hood. Lab
coats made of 100% cotton were worn during all laboratory
procedures and synthetic clothing was avoided as much as
possible during sampling. A triplicate laboratory control was
conducted to detect lab-based contamination. To account for
base-level
environmental
MP
contamination,
background
samples were collected and run in triplicate. The background
for the Tuttle burn site was a eld in nearby Stillwater, OK, and
the background for Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass
dump site was adjacent ranch land. No prior dumping or
burning was reported in any of these background sites.
2.2
Site characterization and sample collection
Faculty of Little Big Horn Community College, Crow Agency, MT,
identied ‘Crow Agency burn site’ and ‘Lodge Grass dump site’,
which serve approximately 2000 and 440 people, respectively.
Homeowners of Tuttle, OK, identied the burn site which serves
two people. Faculty and the homeowners described current solid
waste management practices. The approximate area of each site
was determined using Google Earth. The area of the Tuttle burn
site was approximately 50 m2. The areas of the Crow Agency burn
site and Lodge Grass dump site were approximately 32 200 m2 and
36 000 m2, respectively (Table S1†). Aerial images and sampling
coordinates are available in Fig. S1 and Table S3.† Partners from
Little Big Horn Community College reported that solid waste
burning occurred regularly at the Tuttle burn site and Crow Agency
burn site, while primarily dumping without burning occurred at
Lodge Grass dump site. The Tuttle burn site has been in use for
about 30 years, while Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass
dump site began only about 2 years prior to the sampling date.
The trash piles were not homogenous; thus, sites were
divided into quadrants (based on cardinal directions) to
account for variation in soil or MP characteristics. Samples were
collected in a randomized design, and samples were taken with
two diﬀerent purposes: (1) we collected a bulk sample to ∼18 cm
in depth using a shovel to determine texture and organic matter
content; and (2) we collected soil from ∼0 to 9 and 9 to 18 cm
depths using a 2.54 cm diameter soil probe to evaluate MP size
and content distribution. Bulk and core samples were taken
from the same quadrants. Approximations in sample depth
were due to varied compaction levels across the sampling areas
which at times physically limited the depth to which the probe
could be driven into the soil. Three sampling locations were
selected randomly within each quadrant of the pile. Subsamples

approximately ∼1 kg of soil per composite sample, providing
four replicate soil samples per site. Samples were collected in
3.78 L new and clean plastic sealable bags to retain moisture
during transport and were refrigerated upon arrival at the
laboratory. The bulk samples were used for soil texture and
organic matter analyses and the 0–9 cm and 9–18 cm probe
samples were used for MP analyses.
2.3
Soil characterization & preparation
The bulk and probe samples were each passed through
a 4.75 mm sieve for homogenization then dried at 50 °C over-
night. This drying temperature was chosen to prevent thermal
oxidization of MPs in samples. Bulk samples were sent to the
Oklahoma State University Soil, Water, Forage Analytical
Laboratory for texture analysis using the hydrometer method.31
The organic matter content of bulk samples was determined
with a loss on ignition procedure in a subset of each sample that
was not used for MP analyses.32 Texture and organic matter
characterization and area information are provided in the ESI
le (Table S1).†
2.4
Microplastic extraction
Microplastic extractions from the 0–9 cm and 9–18 cm soil
samples of each quadrant were performed in triplicate. For each
replicate, 10 g of dry soil was elutriated following the procedure
outlined in Forsythe et al.33 to remove dense non-plastic mate-
rial from the sample. Briey, 10 g of dry soil was sonicated in DI
water to break up aggregates, then elutriated in a column for
15 min using an upow velocity of 1.3 cm s−1. Particles with
a lower settling velocity were captured in a 45 mm eﬄuent
collection sieve. Particles in the sieve were rinsed into a glass
beaker with water for transport to the designated MP laboratory.
At the MP laboratory, the water-particle slurry was ltered
through a 20 mm stainless steel mesh using a glass lter unit.
Particles retained on the mesh were rinsed into a 250 mL glass
Erlenmeyer ask with 150 mL of 7.5% w/w NaOCl for digestion.
Erlenmeyer asks were secured on an incubator shaker table at
300 rpm at 50 °C for 24 h. Aer this, digestate was ltered
through a 20 mm stainless steel mesh using a glass lter unit.
Retained particles were thoroughly rinsed with DI water, then
rinsed into 15 mL falcon tubes using 5.1 M ZnCl2 (∼693 g L−1)
for a density separation procedure.34 Falcon tubes were vortexed
then centrifuged at ∼12 300 ms−2 for 5 min. The supernatant
was ltered onto a 20 mm stainless steel mesh, and tubes were
relled with ZnCl2 and vortexed until the pellet was resus-
pended and well-mixed. This procedure was repeated until each
falcon tube had been centrifuged and the supernatant ltered
three times. The particles retained from the supernatant were
rinsed thoroughly with DI water, then rinsed onto a 13 mm
diameter 2 mm pore size Al2O3 lter for MPs analyses using
a glass ltration unit.
2.5
Particle quantication and size analysis
The particle quantication and size analyses were performed
according to Quiambao et al.35 and details of the method are
available in the ESI.† Briey, extracted particles were imaged
with a stereomicroscope (AmScope 7X-180X Trinocular Zoom
Stereo Microscope) as initial visual identication using Al2O3
lters. Each Al2O3 lter was placed in a clean glass Petri dish
and dyed with ∼30 mL of 2 mg Nile Red per mL methanol solu-
tion for uorescence microscopy analyses. Particles were leto
react with the dye for 10 min then rinsed with 200 mL of ACS
grade ethanol on a glass ltration stack to remove excess dye.
Filters were placed in a Greiner 6-well plate and imaged with
a uorescence microscope (Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi Mode
Reader, Agilent Technologies) using an RFP lter cube (excita-
tion 531 nm/emission 593 nm). Gen5® soware was used for
imaging, which allowed us to obtain a single stitched image of
each lter from a series of 4x magnication images (Tables S6–
S9†). The resolution limit of Cytation 5 cell Imaging at this
magnication is about 15 mm pixel−1. Each image was pre-
processed to reduce background uorescence. Microplastics
were quantied by running the stitched image through the
MPVAT 2.0 macros using ImageJ.36 To avoid over-quantication
caused by the 15 mm pixel−1 limit of the Cytation, particles
smaller than 40 mm were excluded from quantication and only
the lter ow-through area was considered. Stereomicroscope
and uorescence microscope images are found in Tables S6–
S9.†

from each triplicate was selected for ATR-FTIR analysis. Ten
percent of the suspected plastic particles identied during
uorescence quantication were analyzed with m ATR-FTIR;
a minimum of ve particles were required for all lters
regardless of MP count and a maximum cap was set at 15
particles due to lengthy analysis time. In total, 59 particles were
examined from Tuttle burn site, 110 from Crow Agency burn
site, and 120 from Lodge Grass dump site. Each lter was
mounted on a gold mirror slide and a mosaic image of the lter
ow-through area was acquired with OMNIC Picta® soware to
aid in the selection of particles. ATR-FTIR measurements were
collected with a cooled detector and Germanium tip, 51 s
collection time with 256 scans, spectral range of 4000–675 cm−1
and a resolution of 8 cm−1. Aperture size was adapted to t each
examined particle. The resulting spectra were searched against
the OMNIC Picta® stock polymer libraries (HR Polymer Addi-
tives and Plasticizers, Hummel Polymer Sample Library, Poly-
mer Laminate Films, and Synthetic Fibers by Microscope) and

which
included

house library was generated by adding the ATR spectra of
common consumer plastics (bottles, wrappers. containers)
which were thermally oxidized in an oven at 100, 200, and 300 °
C for 1, 8, and 48 h. Prior to oxidation all materials were care-
fully cleaned. The library was also augmented with UV oxidized

Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
Soil samples were prepared for Pyrolysis gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) following the methodology
explained in the section 2.3 Soil Characterization and Prepara-
tion of this manuscript.33 Briey, samples were weighed out
between 1–2 mg on an ultra-balance (EPE26 Precision Balance,
Mettler Toledo). Analysis was conducted with an EGA/PY-3030D
pyrolysis unit (Frontier Labs, Koriyama, Japan) attached to an
Agilent 6890 GC/5975 MS system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Quantication
was
performed
following
the
method
of
described by Forsythe et al.,33 and all measured masses were
normalized to the original sample mass to give units of mg
(plastics) to g (dry soil)−1.

Data analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in Minitab Statistical
Soware 22® and MicrosoExcel®. Outliers were determined
by Grubb's test, and outliers were excluded from further anal-
ysis. All sample groups were then tested for normality using
a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Samples from Lodge Grass, Crow
Agency, and Tuttle were compared to the lab control and their
corresponding
background

and
diﬀerences
were
assessed for each site between depths and locations. One-way
ANOVA and unpaired t-tests were performed to determine the
signicance of observed diﬀerences.

Results and discussion
3.1
Open dumping and burning sites contribute to
microplastic pollution
Particle abundance: both community-wide open dump and
open burn sites contributed signicantly (p < 0.05, Table S21†)
to environmental contamination. The highest particle abun-
dance was detected in the Lodge Grass dump site with a mean
of 17 900 particles kg−1 in the 0–9 cm prole and 24 000 parti-
cles kg−1 in the 9–18 cm prole (Fig. 1A). In the Crow Agency
site, the mean particle abundance was 14 700 particles kg−1 in
the 0–9 cm prole and 17 200 particles kg−1 in the 9–18 cm
prole. Our data also indicate that the community-wide open
dumping and burning sites contained a signicantly higher
abundance (p < 0.05, Table S21†) of particles compared to the
single-family site (Fig. 1). At all three sites, the highest MP count
was observed in the 9–18 cm soil depth though they show no
signicant diﬀerences (p-value 0.05, Table S21†).
The abundance of particles at the three sites is equivalent to
or exceeds reported concentrations from currently understood
key sources of terrestrial MPs including biosolids application
and other agricultural practices.38,39 For example, biosolids can
contain up to 14 000 items kg−1, and concentrations higher
than 5190 particles kg−1 soil have been found in biosolids-
applied agricultural elds.40,41 A range from 900 to 40 800
items kg−1 soil was found in agricultural soils in Yunnan
Province, China – the abundance attributed in part to plastic
mulching.42 The high concentration of particles detected at the
Tuttle burn site, Crow Agency burn site, and Lodge Grass dump
site evidenced that open dumping and burning of solid waste
are a key source of terrestrial MP pollution, especially in the
rural and underserved communities that must utilize the
practice.
The quantity of particles detected in each replicate (analyt-
ical replicate made from each composite) of all quadrants at
Tuttle burn site, Crow Agency burn site, and Lodge Grass dump
site is shown in Table S4,† respectively. Quantication at
background sites and in lab controls is found in Table S5.†
Stereomicroscopy and uorescence microscopy for all sites,
background, and lab controls are shown in Tables S6–S9.†
Particle size: the average size of particles found at Crow
Agency site was 228.4 ± 136.97 and 226.8 ± 117.30 mm for the 0–
9 cm and 9–18 cm cores, respectively (Fig. 1D). At the Lodge
Grass site, the average size was 224.3 ± 128.73 and 263.9 ±
187.11 mm for the 0–9 cm and 9–18 cm cores, respectively
(Fig. 1E). Finally, the Tuttle site contained particles with an
average size of 224.5 ± 106.99 and 191.8 ± 84.72 mm (Fig. 1F).
The wide range of particle size (126.4–1872.8 mm) highlights the
heterogenicity of particle sizes found in these sites. Smaller
particles likely occur in these samples; however, the detection
limit was restricted to 130 mm by the high throughput of
samples we analyzed.
We present diﬀerences between depths as a stratication
ratio (the ratio of particles found in the upper/lower prole) and
explore associations with clay content (Fig. 2). Six sites with low
clay had higher abundance in the 0–9 cm depth compared with
3 sites in the 9–18 cm depth. There are a number of factors
which can contribute to the migration and accumulation of MPs
throughout a soil prole.43 Roots and nematodes can inuence
the mobility of MP; for example, corn roots have contributed to
the upward migration of MPs in soil depth of 6–12 cm, while
earthworms inuenced the transport of MPs to deeper sedi-
ments.21,44 Wet and dry cycling can also contribute to the
transport of MPs into the deeper soil column, with more cycling
corresponding to deeper migration of MPs and smaller MPs
(<21 mm) showing the highest mobility.45 Topography, soil
texture, soil compaction, organic matter, and other soil metrics
may aﬀect the transport of MPs. Additionally, freeze-thaw
cycling
may
contribute
to
diﬀerences
in
MP
transport
throughout the soil prole at each site.45
In our experiments, the soil texture of the Tuttle burn site
was sandy or sandy loam, while the soil sampled at Crow Agency

held
more
water-stable
aggregates.
Particularly,
the
soil
sampled in Crow Agency contained 2.5 times more clay than the
Tuttle soil. Clay is oen positively associated with forming
aggregates and controlling pore architecture.46 In soils with clay
content such as Lodge Grass dump site, larger MPs could
potentially inltrate deeper into the soil due to less-compact
characteristics and/or greater pore connectivity. Conversely,
only smaller particles could inltrate the highly compact soil at
Tuttle burn site due to potentially decreased pore connectivity
and reduced water inltration. Clay particles are highly reactive
and may aﬀect the transport of MPs into lower depths.47 The 9–
18 cm prole of Crow Agency burn site contained more MPs in
three of the four quadrants; these clay-rich soils may promote
the accumulation of MPs at this depth due to clay-MP interac-
tions. There was little diﬀerence in soil texture across the
quadrants of Lodge Grass dump site and Tuttle burn site (single
family). Thus, the variation in stratication ratio should
consider other variables alongside texture including bulk
density, aggregation, and water inltration.
The few studies have examined the vertical distribution of
MPs through the terrestrial soil environment have found con-
trasting results.40,48,49 For example, MP abundance was slightly
higher at 20 cm depth (mean particle concentration = 53.2
items m−2) compared to 5 cm depth (mean particle concentra-
tion = 34.6 items m−2), and smaller average particle size was
observed in the deeper proles in agricultural soils from
China.48 A 3-times higher concentration in the 0–10 cm prole
compared to the 20–30 cm was quantied in German agricul-
tural elds.49 Microplastics concentrations did not signicantly
vary between 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm soil depths of biosolids-
applied elds in Spain.40 These results and our data indicate
that it is not possible to make generalizations about the
distribution of MPs through the soil prole.

Functional chemistry analysis of MP
A total of 58 of the 60 particles examined from Tuttle burn site,
105 of 110 particles examined from Crow Agency burn site, and
118 of 120 particles examined from Lodge Grass dump site were
conrmed as MPs by ATR-FTIR. Almost all MPs identied at
each site matched with burned or UV aged plastic spectra.
Examples of identied MPs from each site are shown in Fig. 3
and all examined particles are shown in Tables S10–S16 and
S21.† Oxidation features or changes in the spectra can be

View Article Onlineobserved in several particles compared to the reference spectra
(Fig. 3A–F). The spectra were analyzed according to the corre-
lation charts described in Larkin et al.50 The functional chem-
istry of LLDPE MPs indicated changes in the alkane C–H
stretching region (3000–2840 cm−1), sp3 C–H bend (∼1410–
1325 cm−1), C–O (1125–1000 cm−1), and alkene sp2 C–H (650–
1000 cm−1) compared to the reference spectrum (Fig. 3A).
Likewise, the functional chemistry of PE shied in the
alkane C–H stretching region (3000–2840 cm−1), sp3 C–H bend
(∼1410–1325 cm−1), C–O (1125–1000 cm−1), and alkene sp2
C–H (1000–650 cm−1) and PP MPs (Fig. 3A–C). On the other
hand, PS MPs show diﬀerent features in the aromatic C]C–
stretching region (1675–1475 cm−1) (Fig. 3D–F). Our results
indicate that in open burning sites, MPs are exposed to condi-
tions that modify their functional chemistry which likely aﬀects
the reactivity and mobility of those MPs in the environment.
Discrepancy in the functional chemistry of the reference
spectra,
environmentally
weathered
MPs,
and
thermally
oxidized MPs likely leads to the misidentication or under-
identication of microplastics by current spectral identica-
tion tools. The current challenges of spectral identication
highlight the need to generate more environmentally relevant
spectral
libraries
that
contain
thermally
aged
polymers.
However, more information is needed regarding the occurrence
of thermally oxidized MPs in the environment.
High temperatures and UV radiation may be both dened as
oxidation processes; however, UV radiation is driven by photo-
chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation, reduction decomposition,
and polymerization).51 Particularly in thicker plastics, these are
diﬀusion dependent and occur in the rst 500 to 900 mm layer of
the plastic.52 Thermal oxidation, on the other hand, can aﬀect
the surface and bulk within the same process as a function of
the temperature regardless of the thickness of the plastic.
Both high temperatures and UV radiation cause oxidation,
but through diﬀerent mechanisms.53 Although both processes
produce the similar functional groups, diﬀerences in the
mechanisms that produce these functional groups can lead to
mischaracterization if reference libraries lack a wide array of
spectra. In our study, to analyze the eﬀects of UV and thermal
oxidation, we compared the specic changes in the functional
groups of PE and PS under these conditions (Fig. 4). Our data
show that UV radiation induced less oxidation in the PE

View Article Onlinefunctional chemistry (Fig. 5a). The lack of chromophore species
in PE results in non-UV absorbing structure. Functional groups
observed in the spectrum are likely linked to unidentied
chromophores from additives that absorb UV light and generate
radicals, leading to ketones (1712 cm−1) and vinyl-type unsa-
turation (909 cm−1, 987 cm−1, ∼1640 cm−1) which is consistent
with previous research.51,53,54 In contrast, thermal oxidation
caused the loss of characteristic peaks (2926, 2855, 1465, 1465,
and 720 cm−1) along with the formation of radicals (1369 cm−1
and 1407 cm−1) and carbonyl groups (1712 cm−1, 1180 cm−1,
and 1018 cm−1), respectively. These observations agreed with
previous ndings which found similar eﬀects on the functional
chemistry of PE.53,54 Previous studies have found that at
temperatures above 300 °C, C]C stretching may be caused by
dehydrogenation of an alkane, resulting from the material
degradation and increasing temperatures.54
Polystyrene, unlike PE, contains chromophores in its struc-
ture (specically the phenyl ring), which makes it easier to
identify the distinct eﬀects of UV compared to thermal oxida-
tion (Fig. 5B).51 Data indicate that UV exposure decreased the
characteristic
peaks
at
2919
cm−1
and
generated
C]O
stretching groups (1727 cm−1), while thermal oxidation gener-
ated C]O stretch at 1680 cm−1. However, we observed no other
clear diﬀerences between these oxidation processes. These
results suggest that chromophores in polymers induce a more
eﬃcient absorption of UV radiation at a wider wavelength which
results in a broader attack on the functional chemistry of the
polymer. Other studies that have explored PS degradation UV
conditions also suggest that the chromophore of PS (i.e., the
phenyl functional group) plays a role absorbing UV radiation.55
On the other hand, thermal oxidation decreased the signal of
the peaks at 1600, 1500 and 1468 cm−1.56 Our work evidenced
that open dumping and burning of solid wastes are a source of
MPs with a distinct functional chemical signature.
3.3
Thermally oxidized MPs in soils nearby open burning
sites
Our results indicated that burned MPs occurred with more
frequency in all the sites across the diﬀerent depths (Fig. 5). In
the 0–9 cm depth, the prevalence of burned MPs ranged from
71.2% to 89.8% (Fig. 5A), while the prevalence of burned MPs of
the 9–18 cm depth ranged from 82.1% to 93.8% across the three
sites (Fig. 5A). Lodge Grass, MT, was the site with the highest
abundance of burned MPs in the 0–9 cm range (89.8%), while
Tuttle, OK, was the site with highest relative abundance in the
9–18 cm range (93.8%). In all the sites, polyethylene-bearing
burned MPs (i.e., HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) showed the highest
abundance in both soil depths across all sites (34.6–76.3%).
Finally, when considering the abundance of all plastics
regardless of their state of oxidation, polyethylene-bearing MPs
were the most abundant type in all depths and sites (average
69.78% ± 14.61), followed by PP (8.27% ± 7.88), CV(6.41% ±
4.29), and PS (5.62% ± 3.85).
The higher prevalence of PE compared to other polymers was
conrmed by py-GC/MS in all the sites sampled for total depths
reported (Crow Agency burn site at 5.97 ± 1.75 mg g−1, Lodge
Grass dump site at 4.99 ± 1.95 mg g−1, and Tuttle burn site at
6.13 ± 2.59 mg g−1) (Fig. 6). These data show very similar
concentrations of microplastics across sites including the
single-family site. However, the actual concentration of MPs
found in these samples with py-GC/MS may be underestimated
since the reference materials (standards) available for making
calibration curves and quantifying MPs exclude thermally and
UV oxidized MPs. Microplastics were found with less frequency
at background locations and lab controls than at the open
dump and burn sites.
No discernible pattern can be observed in the polymer type
as a function of depth. For instance, the abundance of PE was
dominant across ve data sets, but we did not detect PE in the
9–18 cm depth from the Tuttle, OK site. From the Crow Agency
site, we did not detect any other polymer in 9–18 cm depth,
while Lodge Grass showed a greater diversity of synthetic poly-
mer in the 9–18 cm depth.
Only two MPs were detected from the representative lab
control sample: one polyethylene and one polypropylene, likely
from laboratory procedures in which plastic could not be avoi-
ded. Compared to lab controls and background site particles
which were primarily white or clear bers, a variety of particle

Conclusions
The results of this work identify open dumping and burning of
solid wastes as a source of elevated concentrations of terrestrial
MPs. Burning practices result in the generation of oxidized MPs
which diﬀer in abundance, size, and functional chemistry from
parent plastic waste solids. The concentration of particles found
at community-wide sites equals or exceeds the concentration of
potential MPs found at other sites with high concentrations of
MPs. We found no signicant diﬀerences in the concentration
of particles across soil depths. The high concentration of MPs
identied at the single-family open dumping and burning sites
highlights the potential of small sites to be as aﬀected as larger
sites. Generation of MPs through open dumping and burning of
solid waste is an issue concerning not only our partner
communities for this study in Oklahoma and Montana, but also
has profound global environmental implications for rural and
urban underserved communities. Open dumping and burning
of solid waste are utilized by approximately a quarter of all
humans on earth, and more work is needed to understand the
full scope and impact of this practice on the surrounding
environment.

"Rice Burning and Asthma Hospitalizations, Butte County, California,
1983-1992

We investigted the association between rice burning and daily asthma hospilizaions in Butet
County,aiia, m 1983 to 1992. Eighty;.two percent of planted rice was burned, with a
mean of 555 acres burned on days when burning was pe
d. For 60% ofthe day during this
period, no rice burning occurred. Peak buning ocrred in fall and sprn but was not

tive risk (RRl) e 1.0001; 95% confidence intrvd (CI), 1.00004-1.0002], after adjusting for maxi-
mum daily temperature, seasonl factors, and yearly population. In this model, burn acreage
showed a do-response effect as acreage burned incr
. Days with the greatest areage burned
(>499 acre) had the Lagest risk of hosplizion (RR
11.23; CL, 1.09-1.39), and days with

Previous research has raised concern over
the role that particulate air pollution plays
in the exacerbation of asthma. Recent stud-
ies have suggested that respirable particulate
pollution (PM1O) is significantly associated
with increased pulmonary morbidity and
mortality at levels well below current federal
standards (1,5. We were concerned with a
problem specific to California-the
postharvest burning of waste rice stubble,
with the subsequent production of res-
pirable particulates and its possible contri-
bution to asthma hospitalizations.
The practice of burning field stubble
and waste rice straw has been occurring
annually in the Sacramento Valley of
California since the 1920s, when farmers
began relying on fire to rid their fields of
waste straw that was difficult to plow under
in heavy, wet fields (3). Today, burning is
still seen as the most cost-effective method
of clearing waste stubble from fields in
preparation for the succeeding plantitg sea-
son, in addition to being the method of
choice for controlling stem-rot disease of
rice, which can severely decrease crop yield
(4). A major problem with rice straw burn-
ing is the emission of smoke and other pol-
lutants into the atmosphere and their effects
on ambient air quality and public health.
One study has shown that burning 1 ton of
dry rice straw emits about 7 pounds of par-
ticulate matter, 80 pounds of carbon
monoxide, and 10 pounds of hydrocarbons
(4). The California Air Resources Board
(CARB) estimated that from 1981 through
1994, Sacramento Valley Air Basin resi-
dents burned an average of 150,000 acres
of rice per year (5). With a 1-acre field
producing 3 tons of rice straw, the amount
of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere
from rice burning is significant. While
minimal health information regarding the
effects of rice straw burning has been com-
piled at present, many citizen complaints
and air pollution problems are reported to
occur during the fall rice straw burning
period, when pressure to burn acreage is at
its peak and meteorological conditions are
usually near their worst for smoke disper-
sion (4,5).
Prior to the 1970s, rice stubble burning
was unregulated; in 1971, in response to
public complaints, the state adopted rules
to minimize maximum daily burn totals.
In the 1980s the rice-growing industry
joined with state officials to set up an air
quality monitoring system to determine
where and when waste rice straw fires
could safely be set (6). In 1991 the state
legislature passed AB 1378, which mandat-
ed a 10% yearly reduction of rice stubble
burning, with the elimination of the prac-
tice entirely by the year 2000 (7I. Since
that time the annual percentage of acreage
permitted to be burned has decreased as
mandated; however, because yearly planted
acreage has increased, the amount of
acreage actually burned each year has only
minimally decreased. Presently, the state
legislature is being asked to consider a
request by rice growers who are asking for a
temporary freeze on the annual allowable
percentage of rice stubble burned, citing
economic hardship. This decision needs to
be made using more information regarding
the health effects related to the inhalation
of emissions from rice smoke.
We reviewed the possible effects of rice
burning on asthma hospitalizations in Butte
County, California, a rural county with the
largest population (182,000) by the 1990
Census (8) of any of California's rice-grow-
ing counties. Our objectives were to deter-
mine the effect of rice straw burning on daily
hospital admissions for asthma in Butte
County from 1983 to 1992. Additionally,
we ascertained whether rice straw burning
was related to air quality parameters [sus-
pended particulate matter <10 pm (PM14),
coefficient of haze (COH) and carbon
monoxide (CO)], which might act as proxies
for exposure to rice smoke.
Materials and Methods
Daily astuna hospitalization information was
compiled using 1983-1992 discharge data
tapes from the Califomia Office of Statewide
Health
Planning and Development
(OSHPD) (9). The data elements gathered
included age, race, and sex of each patient
and the day, month, and year admitted for
only those discharges from Butte County
hospitals with the principal diagnosis of asth-
ma (International Classification ofDiseases,
Revision 9; ICD-9, code 493) (1Q). There
were five hospitals in Butte County that oper-
ated throughout the 10-year time period; two
were located in Chico, with one each in
Oroville, Gridley, and Paradise. See Figure 1
for locations of hospitals and air monitoring
stations.

Air quality data were obtained through
CARB's Air Quality Data series from 1983
to 1992 (11).
Ozone (03) values were continuously
measured by the ultraviolet absorption
photometric method. Hourly average val-
ues were recorded on a daily basis by
CARB. The highest value of the hourly
average values for each day was used in this
study as the daily ozone level (ppm) for
Butte County. Values were obtained from
one site, located in Chico, from 1 January
1983 to 31 December 1992, including 123
days with missing values. Days with miss-
ing environmental data were not more
prevalent during rice burning periods.
There did not appear to be a pattern to the
missing data, which most likely reflected
monitoring machine malfunction.
Carbon monoxide (CO) levels were
measured continuously by the nondispersive
infrared radiation method. Hourly average
values were recorded on a daily basis by
CARB. The highest value of the hourly
average values for each day was used in this
study as the daily CO level (ppm). CO val-
ues were obtained from two monitoring sta-
tions in Chico from 1 January 1983 to 31
December 1992 (including 170 and 327
missing values from stations 1 and 2, respec-
tively). These values were averaged to obtain
the mean daily CO level for Butte County.
Samples of suspended particulate mat-
ter <10 iim (PM1O) were collected approxi-
mately on every sixth day over a 24-hour
period on a quartz fiber filter by using a
high volume sampler equipped with a size-
selective inlet and operated at 36-44
ft3/min. This is a measurement of the mass
concentration of respirable particles that
can deposit in the alveoli. Daily mean val-
ues (in micrograms per cubic meter) were
recorded from three sites in Chico and
from one site in Biggs from 1 January 1983
to 31 December 1992. These values were
averaged to produce an every-sixth day
PM1O level for Butte County. Daily PM1O
values from the every-sixth day data were
calculated by performing a linear regression
using PM1O as the dependent variable and
modeling daily COH measurements, daily
03 values, precipitation amounts, and an
indicator variable for month from a
method suggested by Delfino (12). These
calculated values were recorded as the daily
PMIO level for Butte County.
Soiling index (COH) measurements
were made from particulate matter samples
that were collected by a smoke sampler. In
this procedure, sample air is drawn through
a 1-inch diameter spot of paper filter tape
at a rate of 6.25/1/min. A clean spot of the
filter paper tape is automatically advanced
for sampling every 2-3 hr. A photometer
detects the quantity of light absorbed by
the particulate matter on the tape and pro-
duces a proportional electrical signal. The
quantity of light absorbed, often referred to
as the soiling index, is reported in the
COH scale. Daily COH measurements
were recorded from monitoring stations in
Chico and Gridley from 1 January 1983
through 31 December 1992. These values
were averaged to create a daily COH level
for Butte County.
Weather information was compiled using
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) Climatological
Data California from 1983 to 1992 (13).
Variables recorded induded daily maximum
temperature, daily minimum temperature
(temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit and
were averaged from hourly temperatures),
and daily precipitation totals in inches. All
weather variables were obtained from
NOAA's monitoring station in Chico from 1
January 1983 to 31 December 1992.
Rice acreage burned was compiled
using monthly crop burning acreage tally
sheets on file at the California Air
Resources Board and the Butte County Air
Pollution Control District in Durham,
California (14). Each air district receives
permit applications for agricultural burning
from growers in their region. The district
also keeps daily records of acreage burned
for individual crops and compiles a month-
ly tally sheet, which is filed at the district
level and sent to CARB. Daily burn acreage
amounts were obtained from 1 January
1982 through 31 December 1993. There
were five missing months of daily data
from 1983.
The daily counts of individuals needing
admission to hospitals for asthma in this
population was relatively rare (mean = 0.65
admissions/day) and follows a Poisson dis-
tribution. By contrast, ordinary least
squares regression analysis assumes that the
outcome is normally distributed. Therefore,
we elected to use Poisson regression in our
time-series analysis of rice burning and
environmental factors. Time-series analyses
have been the most sensitive methods for
assessing exposure effects when individual
exposure data is unavailable. We used the
general Poisson equation

where E(Y) denotes the expected number
of hospital admissions by day (i), Xi is the
matrix of covariates stratified by day, and 3
is the estimated regression coefficient.
The basic Poisson regression model ana-
lyzed the association between daily counts of
admission to all of the five Butte County
hospitals and either an individual air quality
parameter (03, CO, PM10, or COH) or rice
burn acreage. The basic model controlled
for temperature (modeled as a continuous
variable) because asthma exacerbations have
been shown to be affected by both heat and
cold (15). The basic model also controlled
for seasonal effects using indicator variables
to account for potential confounders (i.e.,
pollen), which may not be adequately con-
trolled by temperature, because numerous
countries including the United States have
described seasonal increases in both emer-
gency room visits and hospital admissions
(16,17). The county's population grew by
approximately 25% over the 10-year time
span in this study (18), so we used the esti-
mated annual population of Butte County in
the model to control for growth in popula-
tion during the decade of study. We did not
control for age, race, or sex in the regression
because the distribution of these variables in
the population do not vary from day to day
and do not influence the expected number of
asthma hospitalizations. In addition, the pro-
portions of these demographics in the popu-
lation remained constant during the period
of study. Days with missing environmental
data were not considered in the Poisson
regressions. Daily asthma hospitalization
counts and air pollution parameters were
analyzed for serial correlation through ordi-
nary least squares regression, and Durbin-
Watson statistics were derived. Residuals of
daily asthma admission counts were plotted
using autocorrelation-function plots. Both
techniques failed to demonstrate serial corre-
lation of admissions or pollution parameters
(19). The statistical package used for the
analysis was STATA 4.0 for Windows [Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX (20)].
Results
From 1 January 1983 to 31 December 1992
(3,653 days), 837,838 acres of rice were plant-
ed in Butte County, an annual average of
almost 84,000 acres. Over 690,000 acres
were burned (approximately 82% of planted
acreage), with an average annual burn of
69,030 acres. There were 2,253 days without
any rice burning (60%) during the 10-year
period. Of the remaining days, 151 values
were not recorded and 1,249 days had burn-
ing. When only burn days are considered,
the mean acreage burned was 555 acres,
with a median figure of 269 acres burned per
day (Table 1). The amounts ranged from a
low of 1 acre to a high of4,832 acres burned
per day.
Recorded ozone levels averaged 0.05
ppm/day over the 10-year period. The val-
ues ranged from a low of zero to a high of
0.13 ppm. Only 1% of daily ozone values
exceeded the California standard of 0.09
ppm. Daily carbon monoxide levels had a

mean of 2.48 ppm, with values ranging
from zero to over 13 ppm. Again, less than
1% of all recorded values during this time
were above the federal and state standard of
9.0 ppm. Coefficient of haze values averaged
2.36 COH units, with a median value of
1.8. Approximately 20% of recorded COH
values were >1, with approximately 45% of
values exceeding 2 units. Daily PM1O values
had a mean of 34.3 pg/m3, with a median
value of 29.1 pg/m3. Fifteen percent of the
daily values exceeded the California PM1O
standard of 50 pg/mi3.
During the 10-year period, there were
2,361 admissions to Butte County hospitals
with asthma as the primary diagnosis, with
a mean of 0.65 admissions/day. When
admissions were viewed by day, there were
1,978 days with no admissions (54.1%),
1,153 days with one admission (31.6%),
393 days with two admissions (10.8%), and
less than 4% with three or more admis-
sions. Over 50% of all asthma hospitaliza-
tions occurred in two hospitals in Chico,
the largest city in Butte County. Females
constituted 60% of all admissions for asth-
ma in Butte County during this time.
When frequencies were standardized by
person-years, older adults had the highest
rate with 265 admissions/100,000 popula-
tion, and children under 5 years of age had
the second highest rate with 235/100,000
population. The county's overall asthma
hospitalization
rate was 136 admis-
sions/100,000 population, well below the
1987 U.S. average of 188/100,000 (21).
The peak months for admission during
this period were January through March,
with approximately 30% of all admissions.
Admissions slowed in the warmer summer
months (less than 6% of total admis-
sions/month) and then began to rise in the
fall. Yearly admissions peaked in 1989 with
a population-adjusted rate of 177.3 admis-
sions/100,000 population.
Monthly rice burn acreage was observed
relative to air pollution parameters to deter-
mine whether pollution parameters could
be used as proxies for rice burning (Table
2). All air pollutants were poorly correlated
with rice burn acreage, with no Spearman
rank correlation (22) for any pair higher
than 0.06. Ozone levels were strongly corre-
lated with maximum daily temperature
(0.74), carbon dioxide levels were strongly
correlated with daily COH levels (0.72),
and COH values were strongly correlated
with daily PMI0 levels (0.81).
The outcome of interest, daily asthma
admissions to all hospitals in Butte County,
was analyzed in individual Poisson regressions
using a basic model with either daily rice
burn acreage or an individual air pollution
parameter as the exposure of interest (Table
3). All regressions controlled for maximum
daily temperature and season and were
adjusted for the yearly population of Butte
County. All air quality parameters showed
small but nonstatistically significant eleva-
tions of relative risk (RR) for daily asthma
hospitalizations. Elevations of PM1O showed
the largest risk of admission (RR
= 1.04) for
an increase of 1 pg/m3 of PM
concentra-
tion. Burn acreage showed a statistically sig-
nificant elevated risk of admission [RR =
1.0001; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.00004-1.0002] per acre on the day of hos-
pitalization. In this model, maximum daily
temperature showed a statistically significant
protective effect for asthma admissions [RR =
0.99; CI, 0.987-0.995). Winter had the
largest relative risk of admission for asthma
by season in this model (RR =1.15), but this
elevation was not statistically significant.
When burn acreage was categorized and
analyzed with indicator variables in this
model (Fig. 2), we observed a dose-response
effect as acreage burned increased. Days
with the greatest acreage burned (>499
acres) had the largest risk of hospitalization
(RR = 1.23; CI, 1.09-1.39), but days when
100-499 acres were burned also had a statis-
tically significant increased risk of admission
(RR= 1.2; CI, 1.05-1.37).

may be associated with increased asthma
hospitalizations, potential intermediates

totals of rice stubble burned and failed to
show a statistically significant elevation for
risk of admission with asthma. This may be
due to several reasons. First, because asth-
ma admissions to all Butte County hospi-
tals were quite small (<1/day), the power
was insufficient to detect a statistically sig-
nificant difference in admissions per
amount of pollutant measured per day,
despite having 10 years' worth of daily
data. Other factors that may have affected
admissions include problems with access to
health care, physician management prerog-
ative, and severity of the asthma attack.
Measurement error may also have played a
role in failing to find an elevated risk of
asthma hospitalization for population
exposures due to criteria pollutants.
Because there is inherent misclassifica-
tion in the use of fixed-site outdoor moni-
tors to represent overall population exposure
to air pollutants (12), a significant amount
of measurement error may have been intro-
duced into this study. Because the majority
of monitoring stations were located in
Chico, it is questionable whether the mea-
sured pollution values were truly representa-
tive of the population's exposure. In this
study it was assumed that each individual in
Butte County was exposed to the same
amount of pollution, which may be either
an overestimate or underestimate of the
actual exposure. Since only about 25% of
the county's residents live in Chico, three-
fourths of the population may potentially be
misclassified. Additionally, CARB burning
restrictions may be protective for larger
cities like Chico. These restrictions limit
and direct burning so that rice smoke and
particulates produced in the southern and
western part of the county are blown by
westerly winds and may not be measured by
monitors located in Chico (more northerly
located); therefore, residents in locations in
the county other than Chico may be
exposed to higher levels of particulates than
what is measured in Chico. Also, CARB has
regulated rice burning since the early 1980s
and prohibits the burning of rice straw on
days with poor air quality and dispersion
parameters. Days when burning is permitted
are relatively cleaner, with lower measured
pollutant values before the burning and
weather conditions have an increased capaci-
ty to mitigate effects from rice burning.
Finally, in Butte County, measurements for
PM10 were only recorded every sixth day.
We were able to calculate daily PMIO values
based on daily COH measurements, but
further error may have been introduced into
this study by the lack of actual measure-
ments of PM10 on over 80% of the days in
this study.
Despite these limitations, burn acreage
still showed a slight but statistically signifi-
cant increase in asthma hospitalization per
acre of rice burned when modeled with
daily maximum temperature, season, and a
term for yearly population. An increased
risk of admission per acre of rice burned
was still evident in succeedingly more com-
plex models, which also included terms for
criteria air pollutants. More suggestively,
rice burning demonstrated
a
clear
dose-response association with daily
admissions for asthma, with the highest
level of acreage burned contributing an
excess risk of 23%.
Based on the data from this study,
approximately 70,000 acres of rice stubble is
burned annually in Butte County. Prior
studies have shown that substantial amounts
of particulate pollution are generated from
rice burning, which is taken up by the
atmosphere and transported by the wind in
thick, acrid clouds of smoke (4). CARB
tracks smoke complaints from the public
during the intensive fall burning period.
From 1981 through 1984, the days with
smoke-related complaints averaged over
40% (5). While this study failed to demon-
strate a statistically significant relationship
between rice burn acreage and pollution
parameters, the high proportion of smoke-
related complaints suggests that some Butte
County residents are exposed to the smoke
and that air pollution monitoring may not
accurately reflect the actual exposures in
the population.
Limited studies have been published in
the medical literature analyzing the effect of
rice burning on pulmonary health, although
it has been suggested that rice straw smoke
produces an irritant effect to the upper air-
ways (4). While no prior population-based
studies have been performed to examine
this question, McCurdy et al. (23) recently
published their findings of 464 rice farmers
in the northern Sacramento Valley, which
demonstrated some elevations in respiratory
morbidity. They found that the prevalence
for physician-diagnosed asthma (7.1% in
their cross-sectional study) was moderately
above that seen in population-based studies,
such as the National Health Interview
Study. While rice farmers are exposed to
other occupational agents (dusts and pesti-
cides) that may potentially effect respiratory
health, this increased prevalence may also
be due in part to exposure to rice burning.
McCurdy et al. (23) also reported that
chronic cough (coughing on most days of
the week for 3 consecutive months or more
during the year) was associated in a
dose-response fashion with reported hours
per year of burning rice stubble. While
farmers would be expected to have higher
exposures than individuals living farther
from the fields, exposures to these more dis-
tant individuals likely occurs, as evidenced
by increases in complaints to GARB, during
the fall burning season (5). The study of
McCurdy et al. (23) lends biological cre-
dence to the inference that exposure to rice
smoke may produce or exacerbate asthma.
The data from Butte County suggests
that rice burning (especially on days of high
volume burning) may produce a small, but
potentially preventable, effect on asthma
admissions. The population-attributable risk
(PAR; the fraction of the total asthma admis-
sions that would have been prevented if rice
burning had not occurred) can be calculated
from a formula by Bruzzi et al. (24) and was

found to be 2.6% (PAR = 1- 1/x II; l/r,
where x = the total number of asthma cases
and r = each of the relative risks for admis-
sion by burn acreage strata) (24). Dividing
the total number of asthma hospitalizations
in Butte County by the period of the study
(2361/10) and multiplying by the PAR
(2.6%), we see that approximately six asthma
cases/year could be attributable to rice burn-
ing. While this number is relatively small, it
is important to realize that the majority of
individuals who may be affected by rice
burning may never become sufficiently ill to
require hospitalization. These individuals
may include those who regard rice smoke as
a nuisance and complain to the air board or
are silent about this problem. Those with
respiratory or cardiac disease may increase
the frequency of their medications during
burning episodes, visit their regular physi-
cians, or present at the emergency depart-
ment without being observed in the
OSHPD hospital discharge data base.
Our data suggests that while CARB
regulations have been effective in mitigat-
ing the problem of air pollution caused by
rice burning on the basis of monitoring
data analysis, it is less clear that these regu-
lations are as effective in preventing hospi-
talizations for asthma when hospitalizations
are analyzed by actual acreage burned.
Conclusion
Increases in rice straw burn acreage were
shown to contribute to hospital admissions
for asthma in Butte County, California,
during a decade of observation. Rice burn
acreage was not correlated to air pollution
parameters monitored by CARB in limited
parts of the county. These pollution para-
meters were not associated with increases in
asthma hospitalizations. The time-series
method, although insensitive compared to
traditional case-control methods, demon-
strated an apparent association between
acres burned and daily asthma admissions.
Additionally, a dose-response effect was
seen, with the risk of asthma hospitalization
increasing as the number of acres burned
increased. Future studies should attempt to
better clarify exposure perhaps using expo-
sure models broken down by zip code
areas. In addition, future studies may con-
sider using visits to emergency rooms or
local physicians' offices as a better indicator
of respiratory exacerbations. While the use
of hospitalization data was considerably
easier in terms of time spent extracting
records and cheaper in terms of cost, it may
have underestimated the number of those
affected with asthma because there are
many fewer hospitalizations for asthma
than visits to emergency rooms.

Burning of agricultural fields is an understudied source of air pollution in rural communities in the United States. 
Smoke from agricultural burning contains air toxics that adversely impact respiratory health. Imperial County in 
southeastern California is a highly productive agricultural valley that heavily employs agricultural burning to 
clear post-harvest crop remnants. We related individual-level exposure to agricultural burns to parent-reported 
respiratory symptoms in children. 
We leveraged the Children's Assessing Imperial Valley Respiratory Health and the Environment (AIRE) cohort 
of 735 predominantly Hispanic low-income elementary school students in Imperial County. Parents reported 
children's respiratory health symptoms and family demographic characteristics in questionnaires collected at 
enrollment and in annual follow-up assessments from 2017 to 2019. Permitted agricultural burns in Imperial 
County from 2016 to 2019 were spatially linked to children's geocoded residential addresses. We used gener­
alized estimating equations to evaluate prevalence differences (PDs) in respiratory symptoms with increasing 
exposure to agricultural burning within 3 km in the 12 months prior to each assessment.

Nearly half of children (346, 49 %) lived within 3 km of at least one agricultural burn in the year prior to study 
enrollment. In adjusted models, each additional day of agricultural burning in the prior year was associated with 
a one percentage point higher prevalence of wheezing (PD 1.1 %; 95 % CI 0.2 %, 2.0 %) and higher bronchitic 
symptoms (PD 1.0 %; 95 % CI -0.2 %, 2.1 %). Children exposed to four or more days of burning had an absolute 
increased prevalence of wheezing and bronchitic symptoms of 5.9 % (95 % CI -0.3 %, 12 %) and 5.6 % (95 % CI 
-1.8 %, 13 %), respectively, compared to no burn exposure. Associations with wheezing were stronger among 
children with asthma (PD 14 %; 95 % CI -1.4 %, 29 %). 
To our knowledge, this is the first U.S. study of agricultural burning and children's respiratory health. This 
work suggests that reducing agricultural burning could improve children's respiratory health.

Adolescent girls often help with these cooking and household tasks, but little is known about their exposures. We 
characterized 24-h exposures to HAP and household garbage burning in adolescent girls by measuring fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), urinary biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates. We recruited 60 girls between 13 and 17 years of age who helped with 
cooking activities and lived with participants of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. 
We recruited n = 30 girls each from the control (wood-burning stove) and intervention (liquefied petroleum gas 
stove) arms. We also measured real-time kitchen concentrations of BC in 20 homes (33%). PM2.5 and BC were

measured in n = 21 control and n = 20 intervention participants. Median concentrations of personal PM2.5 and 
BC and kitchen BC were lower (p < 0.05) in the intervention arm by 87%, 80%, and 85%, respectively. PAH 
metabolite concentrations were lower (p < 0.001) for all nine metabolites in intervention (n = 26) compared to 
control participants (n = 29). Urinary BPA concentrations were 66% higher in participants who reported using 
cosmetics (p = 0.02), and phthalate concentrations were 63% higher in participants who had reported using hair 
products during the sample period (p = 0.05). Our results suggest that gas stoves can reduce HAP exposures 
among adolescents who are not primary cooks at home. Biomarkers of plastic exposure were not associated with 
intervention status, but some were elevated compared to age- and sex-matched participants of the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

household furnaces and the health 
of their owners

The aim of the study was to determine the scale of emission and airborne dispersion of selected 
pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, TVOC, HCHO) associated with the combustion of various types of municipal 
waste (MW), its mixed stream and separate fractions, in a household furnace, as compared to 
conventional (CF) and alternative (AF) fuels. We demonstrated that each type of fuel (AF, CF, AFw) 
combusted in a household furnace is a significant source of air pollutants, especially fine PM2.5 
particles, whose concentrations exceeded the limit values (3.1–17.2 times for PM2.5 and 0.5–7.4 times 
for PM10). The combustion of MW in household furnaces generated higher levels of PM2.5 (up to 
345 µg/m3) and PM10 (up to 369 µg/m3) than AF or CF, at the same time being a significant source of 
TVOC (up to 0.3 mg/m3) and HCHO (0.4 mg/m3). The analysis showed that according to the Polish and 
European classification, air quality (AQI) during the combustion of all the materials analyzed is very 
poor (n = 12) or extremely poor (n = 19). The combustion of such materials as polystyrene, rubber and 
upholstery foam in household furnaces generates drastically high health risk to local inhabitants. We 
found that the combustion of polystyrene generated the highest Cancer Risk (CR) values of 1.04E-01 
(children) and 2.60E-02 (adults), exceeding the acceptable level multiple times (CR > 10–6). Inhalation 
exposure to very poor air quality can lead to health problems, such as disorders of the respiratory, 
cardiovascular and immune systems. Additional risk is posed by solid fuel combustion in rural areas, 
which may be a significant factor deteriorating the chemical condition of soils, especially those used for 
agricultural purposes.
Keywords  PM2.5, PM10, TVOC, HCHO, Health risk
Out of all contemporary environmental factors, air pollution has the greatest negative impact on human life and 
health1–3. Depending on the type and time of exposure to harmful substances in the air, people may suffer from 
various conditions, which can even lead to diseases, predominantly of the circulatory and respiratory systems, 
but also the reproductive and nervous systems4–6. Air pollution is most harmful to children, the elderly and the 
chronically ill7,8. According to statistical data for Poland, almost 30% of children under the age of 2 and over 50% 
of the population over 60 years of age receive continuous medical care9. It is estimated that several million people 
around the world die every year due to poor air quality10–12.
Poland is a European country where there is still much to be done with regard to air quality improvement13–15. 
Air quality in Polish cities is among the poorest in the European Union16. This pertains to the above-standard 
levels of such substances as PM10 and PM2.5 particulates and benzo(a)pyrene. In 2011, six out of ten European 
cities having the highest number of days with exceeded permissible daily concentration of PM10 were located 
in Poland17. Undoubtedly, this stems from the fact that fossil fuels are the main materials for the energy sector, 
which are used e.g., for the heating of households and public institutions 18. Although the data refers to a situation 
from over 10 years ago, air quality in Polish cities has remained poor or very poor17. Therefore, the country 
had to take corrective action in terms of reducing low emissions (anti-smog resolutions requiring furnace and 
coal boiler replacement), installing renewable sources of energy systems (i.e., the use of biogas, installation of 
photovoltaic panels, solar collectors, heat pumps), heating residential and public buildings, and expanding the 
district heating and gas network19. Measures taken to reduce transportation emissions have mainly focused on 
the purchase of low- or zero-emission public transportation buses, construction of new routes for public and 
bicycle transportation, modernization and repair of tramway tracks, creation of paid parking zones and more 
frequent removal of dust accumulated on the roads. Actions taken to reduce industry emissions have included

www.nature.com/scientificreportsinspections at particularly harmful plants, implementation of the best available techniques (BAT) and creation of 
an emission database based on the permits issued for the largest industrial plants. These activities are sanctioned 
by relevant legislation.
In terms of the air quality law, and in particular the reduction of low emissions, two European Union directives 
are of greatest importance. The first one is Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe20, also called the CAFE Directive (Clean 
Air for Europe). It is the main legal act in the European Union concerning the reduction of emissions of such 
pollutants as: PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2, NOx, CO, Pb and C6H6. The second act is Directive 2004/107/EC of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel 
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air21. It concerns the reduction of PAH emissions, 
especially B(a)P, generated mainly in the household and municipal waste sector. It sets out the target values for 
As, Cd, Ni and B(a)P measured in PM10, the number of sampling points, the criteria for selecting their location, 
the data quality required and the reference measurement methods.
Poor air quality is largely due to PM10, PM2.5 and benzo(a)pyrene in PM10, which are mainly emitted as 
a result of burning low-quality fuels in households1,22–25. What is also observed in Poland is the practice of 
burning municipal waste in household furnaces18, although it raises many controversies and is legally prohibited 
by national and local law26. Household furnaces are mainly charged with solid fuels, i.e., hard coal, wood or 
wood pellets. Sadly, it is still common to encounter illegal practices of burning selected fractions of municipal 
waste in these furnaces. The quality and quantity of waste generated from combustion, i.e., ash, depends on the 
thermal decomposition technology (technological parameters of the boiler) and the type of the raw material 
used in the system18,27.
In rural areas in Poland, the proportion of municipal waste in the total waste collected is decreasing, unlike 
in the other European countries28. This decline does not result from green behavior, whose aim is to reduce 
waste generation, but stems from the fact that some waste fractions, or worse—their mixed stream, are burnt in 
household furnaces. This action is aimed at reducing the cost of heating by using the heat obtained from burning 
this “free furnace fuel”. According to a study by Lim et al.24, this practice is closely related to people’s income 
level and economic situation. As shown by Kicińska and Caba29, the toxic properties of ash are determined by its 
morphological and chemical composition. Compounds contained in ash are readily leached and dispersed in the 
water-soil environment. Excessive concentrations of these substances, i.e., sulfates, phosphates, chlorides, oxides 
of silicon, aluminum, magnesium, iron, and calcium, and potentially toxic elements, including: Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, 
Zn etc., which are the main constituents of ash, have an adverse effect on the components of the environment, as 
demonstrated in studies by AlMulla et al.30 and Wei et al.31. These substances directly pollute the soil, water and 
air, and have an indirect effect on the entire ecosystem and the health of organisms living in it1,32,33.
The consumer market offers numerous classes of household furnaces (boilers) for burning various types 
of solid fuels, both conventional (hard coal, lignite) and alternative (coal pellets, pellets), as well as biomass 
(wood, green waste). However, these appliances are not suitable for burning waste, and especially not the mixed 
waste stream. There are various chemical reactions taking place in the combustion chamber (at a relatively low 
temperature of 250–480 ⁰C), which are associated with the presence of different materials (e.g., PVC, paints, 
adhesives, varnishes, solvents, plastics etc.). As a result, volatile compounds (e.g., formaldehyde or organic 
compounds) and harmful or even toxic substances are emitted through exhaust chimneys34,35.
In light of these facts, the main aim of the present study was to determine the emission and airborne 
dispersion of selected pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, HCHO – formaldehyde and TVOC – total volatile organic 
compounds) associated with the combustion of various types of municipal waste, its mixed stream and separate 
fractions, in a household boiler. The other research objective was to assess health risk associated with the effect 
of these pollutants on local inhabitants. An innovative element of the work is that it demonstrates the degree 
of harm caused by the combustion of individual fractions of municipal waste in inadequate systems, such as 
household furnaces.
Research area
The air quality analysis was conducted in the village of Żydów, located in Igołomia-Wawrzeńczyce commune, 
in Małopolska Province (Poland, EU). Igołomia-Wawrzeńczyce is a typically rural commune, with some extent 
of service and manufacturing activity. Agricultural land accounts for 90.5% of the commune’s area, forests and 
woodlands for 0.6% and surface water for 2.8%. Housing and transportation areas take up over 5.2% of the area 
and the remaining area (0.9%) is wasteland. The surface area of the village is 2 ha and the number of inhabitants 
is 188. About 90% of inhabitants have connections to mains gas. All the residential, public, and commercial and 
service buildings in the commune have individual heating systems powered by coal (80%) and gas (20%). All the 
public buildings have gas-fired boiler rooms.
The area’s climate is a combination of subcontinental and central European climate. The average daily 
temperature is 8.7 °C (13.3 °C during the day and 4.1 °C at night). The annual rainfall is 672 mm36. The heating 
season lasts from October to the end of April (7 months).
The selected air quality parameters were measured at six sampling points in Żydów (Fig. 1). Their selection 
was determined by: site accessibility, lack of tall vegetation, and location relative to the source of emissions 
(mainly due to the dominant wind direction, west: points 2 and 3, south-west: point 1, and north-east: points 
4, 5 and 6). The distance between the emission source where the collected material was combusted (Fig. 1) and 
sampling points 1–6 was as follows (data in m): 16.7, 53.3, 100, 16.7, 41.7 and 75.

The 32 materials (Table 1) incinerated in a Keller 10 kW chamber furnace (with nominal heating capacity of 
10 kW, efficiency of 80%, and maximum working pressure of 0.25 MPa) located in a private household were as 
follows:
•	 conventional fuels (CF, n = 3) comprising hard coal from various fuel storage sites,
•	 alternative fuels (AF, n = 8) including: coal pellets, wood pellets, straw and green waste,
•	 alternative fuels—wood (AFW, n = 5) including the wood of walnut Juglans L., willow Salix L;, acacia Acacia 
Mill. and oak Quercus L,
•	 mixed municipal waste (MMW, n = 3), comprising mixed samples of all waste fractions generated in house­
holds,
•	 municipal waste (MW, n = 11), comprising the following separately collected fractions: paper, textiles, ply­
wood, upholstery foam, artificial leather, rubber, polystyrene and PVC packaging (used to store mineral oils 
or plant protection agents).
The self‐ignition temperatures (data in °C) were as follows: 450–550 for hard coal, 250–280 for peat, 210–320 
for wood (different types), 230 for straw, 550 for coal pellets, and 180–260 for municipal waste (different types). 
A full description of the furnace charge preparation process has been provided in a paper by Kicińska and 
Caba37. The weight of the incinerated material, which had previously been fragmented, homogenized, reduced 
and divided into feed portions, was about 5 kg.
CF and AF were collected selectively (i.e., based on the type that is most commonly used in households in the 
study area). On the other hand, MW (dry fraction) was collected into a separate container and then processed 
by grinding or crushing. In this part of the study, maintaining similar combustion conditions was of utmost 
importance.
Statistical calculations and data presentation were conducted with the Statistic ver. 13.3 and Excel applications. 
The differences between means were detected by the Tukey HSD test at a significance level of 0.05. To analyze 
the possible effect of the burning of different materials on air quality parameters (PM2.5, PM10, HCHO and 
TVOC), as well as the possible influence of atmospheric conditions (wind direction, speed of wind [km/h], 
pressure [hPa], temperature [°C] and rain [mm]) recorded during sampling at different sampling points, a 
regression analysis was performed in R26. The lm() function within the Stats package was used for this purpose. 
This function allows the analysis of the effect on continuous variables (air quality parameters) produced by 
categorical or factor variables (i.e. fuel type, sampling point, wind direction) and numerical variables (wind 
speed, atmospheric pressure, temperature and precipitation). The application of this tool allows for determining 
whether the changes in the average concentration of the different atmospheric pollutants associated with the 
value of one of the categorical variables (for example, the burning of a certain fuel or a given sampling point) are 
statistically significant.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/The air quality parameters measured were: PM2.5 and PM10 [measured in μg/m3], and HCHO and TVOC 
[mg/m3]. The measurement of each parameter was repeated twice and the result included in the analysis was 
the average value. The measurements were performed at six points (1–6, Fig. 1), during a heating period from 7 
January to 6 February 2022 using an air quality sensor Webber SP 86, at a fixed time, in the evening (6–8 PM). 
The measurements were taken at the height of 1.5 m above ground level. The detection limits for the sensor used 
were as follows: 0.1 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and PM10 and 0.001 mg/m3 for HCHO and TVOC. Typically, HCHO and 
TVOC are measured indoors. However, this time we decided to carry out the measurements outdoors.
Health risk assessment
The health risk assessment associated with the presence of a harmful substance/element is usually based on 
estimating the magnitude of the risk and classifying it as carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic. Non-carcinogenic 
risk (HQ) is determined by comparing the calculated doses of pollutants which entered the body via individual 
exposure routes (in this case, inhalation) with the corresponding reference doses (RfD). In turn, carcinogenic 
risk (CR) is estimated as the lifetime probability of developing cancer as a result of exposure to a given carcinogen 
through a given route of exposure.
Risk assessment for formaldehyde (HCHO)
Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessment for HCHO was conducted using the methodology 
recommended by the US EPA38–42 To determine the value of health risk associated with inhalation exposure, 
inhalation exposure concentration (ECinh) was calculated using Eq. (1):

Results and discussion
Air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, HCHO, TVOC) and the type of fuel combusted
Air quality measurements were carried out in the coldest months of the year, namely January and February 
(winter time). In the study area, this is the peak of the heating season, which determines air quality. The 
concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 at the six sampling points ranged from 62 to 345 µg/m3 and from 75 to 
369 µg/m3, respectively (Table 2). The levels of PM10 were higher than those of PM2.5 at nearly all sampling 
points. The finer fraction, i.e., PM2.5, accounted for an average of 91% of the PM10 fraction, which is consistent 
with the data published by Faria et al.4 and Yu et al.47. The coarse fraction also comprised larger particles, with 
a diameter of 2.5–10 µm, which are mineral particles lifted by wind from the ground. The proportion of these 
forms in the particulate matter in the winter time is small and, as shown in the present study, reaches only 9%. 
This result indicated, as expected, the dominant role of a point source of pollution, namely a chimney conveying 
exhaust gases and solid pollutants. The analysis showed that the impact of other sources of pollution in this area 
was small.
The obtained values (Table 2) significantly exceeded the limit values for PM2.5 and PM10 in the air set out 
for the protection of human health20,48,49, for the 24-h average, i.e., 20 and 50 µg/m3, for all materials (fuels) at all 
sampling points. In the case of PM2.5, the levels were exceeded 3.1–17.2 times and in the case of PM10, 0.5–7.4 
times (Fig. 2). The situation is very concerning, especially with respect to PM2.5. Particulates with a diameter 
smaller than 2.5 µm are atmospheric aerosols considered most harmful to human health, as they can easily and 
directly penetrate into the trachea or bronchi and consequently enter the bloodstream. Respirable dust particles 
play a role in the exacerbation of asthma, impaired lung function, lung, throat and larynx cancers, cardiac 
arrhythmias, vasculitis, atherosclerosis and low birth weight and respiratory problems in babies exposed to these 
particulates during fetal development4,6. They have also been reported to exacerbate circulatory and respiratory 
symptoms in people suffering a long-term exposure to these particulates10. In turn, PM10 are a mixture of 
suspended particles, whose diameter does not exceed 10 µm. Their detrimental effect is associated with the 
presence of other harmful substances, i.e. benzopyrenes, furans or dioxins, also in the form of potentially toxic 
elements (Zn, Tl, As, Pb, Cd or Hg). They negatively affect the respiratory system, being responsible for coughing 
attacks, wheezing, rapid bronchitis or the development of asthma. A study by Park et al.7 demonstrated that a 
long-term exposure to PM10 indirectly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.
As already mentioned, the obtained values indicate that PM2.5 and PM10 levels exceeded the limit values 
at all sampling points and for all materials, regardless of whether these were conventional or alternative fuels 
(Fig.  2). The average PM2.5 and PM10 levels in the air after the combustion of individual groups of fuels 
decreased in the following order (PM2.5, PM10 – data in µg/m3): selected fractions of municipal waste (169, 
202) > conventional fuels – hard coal (133, 146) > wood – various species (130, 138) > mixed stream of municipal 
waste (121, 127) > alternative fuels – various types (106, 117).
The second group of air quality parameters measured were organic pollutants, i.e., formaldehyde (HCHO) 
and volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The first one—formaldehyde (methanal), is an organic compound 
formed during the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing substances. It is the key compound among 
the oxidized forms of volatile organic substances found indoors due to its presence in numerous materials 
(including varnishes, paints, and adhesives) and even preservatives. Therefore, multiple materials are saturated 
with formaldehyde. Our measurements showed that at all sampling points the concentration of this compound 
did not exceed 0.400 mg/m3, which is the odor detection threshold. In concentrations exceeding 0.01 ppm, 
formaldehyde may cause irritation of the epidermis, nasopharyngeal mucosa and eyes. According to the

www.nature.com/scientificreports/guidelines by the German Ministry of the Environment50, formaldehyde levels should not exceed 0.1 mg/m3 in 
indoor air.
Volatile organic compounds (TVOC), the other indicator measured, have a high tendency to evaporate 
(especially at low temperatures), causing gaseous air pollution51,52. Our study showed that the air levels of TVOC 
levels ranged from trace amounts (< 0.001 mg/m3) to max. 0.3 mg/m3 (Table 2). It is believed that concentrations 
below 0.2 mg/m3 do not cause irritation or poor well-being, whereas levels in the range of 0.2–3.0 mg/m3 are 
conducive to irritation and well-being deterioration50. The WHO established an indoor air quality guideline of 
0.1 mg/m3for a 30-min exposure49.
Thus, HCHO and TVOC concentrations at selected sampling points exceeded the limit values (i.e., 0.01 and 
0.02 mg/m3, respectively). In the case of HCHO, this pertained to wood (different species), mixed municipal 
waste and some groups of municipal waste (i.e., PVC packaging, polystyrene, rubber and upholstery foam). As 
for TVOC, the limit values were exceeded in the case of mixed municipal waste and some fractions of municipal 
waste, i.e., PVC packaging, polystyrene, rubber, upholstery foam and furniture boards (Fig. 3). Some countries 
have set out standards for the limit values of TVOC, but these apply to indoor air quality. For example, the 
Chinese limit value for TVOC is 0.6 mg/m353, while relevant legislation in Germany specifies the following 
HCOH and TVOC concentrations (ppm): 0.001–0.4 and 0.3–1.2, respectively.
The average HCHO and TVOC levels in the air after the combustion of individual groups of fuels decreased 
in the following order (HCHO, TVOC – data in mg/m3): separate fractions of municipal waste (0.044,

www.nature.com/scientificreports/0.041) > mixed stream of municipal waste (0.022, 0.018) > wood – different types (0.010, 0.005) > conventional 
fuels – hard coal (0.007, 0.002) > alternative fuels – different types (0.002, 0.002).
Having analyzed the impact of the combustion of conventional and alternative fuels on the amount of 
inorganic pollutants in the air, we found that CF generated the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (133 
and 146 µg/m3, respectively). In turn, the combustion of AF, such as coal pellets, straw, green waste or wood 
pellets, generated PM2.5 and PM10 amounts that were approximately 20% lower compared to CF (106 and 
117 µg/m3, respectively). A slightly different situation was observed for wood combustion (various types). Here, 
the PM2.5 and PM10 values were only slightly lower, by about 2% (130 and 138 µg/m3, respectively), than the 
results recorded for CF. For the wet wood sample, the values of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air were 10% higher than 
for the wood sample of the same species, but dried out.
As for organic pollutants, the highest concentrations in the air, both for HCHO and TVOC, were recorded 
after burning various wood species (AFw). The average concentrations of these parameters recorded for this entire 
group of fuels were 0.022 and 0.004 mg/m3, respectively, being 10- and twofold higher than the concentrations 
observed for other AF, and 3- and twofold higher than those recorded for CF. These relationships stem from the 
chemical composition of the primary materials. This is because the main mass of wood is comprised of organic 
substances consisting of 4 main elements: C (about 49.5%), H (6.3%) and O2 and N (44.2% in total, with the 
share of N being about 0.12%). The proportion of mineral matter is low and depends on the species of wood, 
but does not exceed 0.2–1.7 wt%54. In contrast, hard coal contains from 75% to as much as 97% of C, while 
other elements such as: H (2–6%), O2 (1–18%), N (0.5–2%) and S (0.2–2%) make up the rest of its chemical 
composition55,56. The high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) may be due to the high content (up 
to 40%) of mineral matter (ash – the residue from incomplete combustion), which is transferred to the external 
environment through the chimney57. The chemical composition of ash (composed mainly of Al, Fe, Si, Ca, Na, 
K, and S oxides and elements described as potentially toxic: Cu, Pb, Cd, Hg) and its effect on human health as 
well as environmental pollution have been the subject of numerous scientific studies58–62.
These differences have direct health implications for individuals breathing polluted air, especially in the long 
term. In terms of pollutant emissions (organic and inorganic) and their impact on human health, the least 
harmful fuels burned in household furnaces are coal pellets and wood pellets.
In summary, the combustion of individual fuel groups and the obtained PM2.5, PM10, HCOH and TVOC 
values showed that:
•	 the highest average concentrations (for all materials analyzed n = 32) were observed during the combustion 
of polystyrene; these were 249 and 281 µg/m3 (PM2.5, PM10) and 0.176 and 0.195 mg/m3 (HCOH, TVOC),

www.nature.com/scientificreports/•	 in the MMW group, the highest concentrations were recorded for sample no. III (155, 149, 0.013 and 0.042, 
respectively); this was mixed waste collected in a detached house inhabited by two adults who frequently shop 
online,
•	 in the AF group, the highest concentrations were found during the combustion of green waste (120, 132, 
0.004, 0.004, respectively); its main constituents were dry kitchen waste and shrub and grass cuttings,
•	 in the AFw group, the highest concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and HCOH were recorded during the combus­
tion of wet willow wood (152, 166 µg/m3 and 0.23 mg/m3, respectively). For the sample of the same wood, but 
dried out, these values were on average 20% lower,
•	 in the CF group, for the two hard coal samples analyzed, the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 
155 and 168 µg/m3, respectively, and those for HCOH and TVOC were 0.011 and 0.003 mg/m3, respectively.
Airborne dispersion of pollutants
A chimney discharging exhaust gases from a furnace (boiler), where the fuel combustion process takes place, is a 
typical point source of pollution. The airborne dispersion of harmful substances contained in the plume depends 
on the height reached by the exhaust gases, the size of their particles and climatic factors, i.e., atmospheric 
stability, humidity, and wind direction and speed63,64. The substances are mainly transported by wind and mix 
with the surrounding air, with the scattering taking place horizontally (this process occurs much faster and 
depends on the topography of the area) and vertically65,66.
To analyze air pollutant dispersion from a point source, we employed the Gaussian Dispersion Model, which 
uses a normal distribution curve (Gaussian distribution) to describe the concentration of harmful substances. 
The variables included in the analysis were the emission rate from the source and wind speed. Ground level 
concentration was calculated using Eq. (4).

www.nature.com/scientificreports/In our study, we analyzed the concentrations of the substances in the air, but not at ground level, which is 
undoubtedly important in soil research, but at the level of a person’s mouth and nose (i.e., 1.5 m). The selection 
of the sampling points has been described in the previous subsection.
At the initial stage of the analysis, we verified whether there were any associations between the factors 
studied (Table 3, Fig. 4). The statistical analyses (i.e., correlation coefficients, cluster analysis and factor analysis) 
indicated that:
•	 atmospheric factors (such as wind speed and direction and temperature) play a major role in the dispersion 
of pollutants (Fig. 4B),
•	 wind direction plays a major role in PM2.5 and PM10 dispersion (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the find­
ings obtained by Galán-Madruga et al.66,
•	 there is a very strong correlation between the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (r = 0.88),
•	 there is a very strong correlation between the concentrations of HCHO and TVOC (r = 0.68), and between 
organic pollutants (HCHO and TVOC) and particulate matter pollutants (Tab. 4), r = 0.67 and 0.64 for PM2.5 
and r = 0.63 and 0.60 for PM10, respectively.
We analyzed pollutant dispersion for all the substances combusted (Fig. 5S). The analysis revealed that:
•	 under the same atmospheric conditions, particulate pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) disperse somewhat differ­
ently than organic pollutants (TVOC and HCHO). Organic pollutant plumes are considerably smaller and 
narrower (samples 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 16, 25, 26, 31, and 32) as compared to particulate matter plumes,
•	 PM2.5 and PM10 dispersion plumes for the majority of the materials analyzed are very similar (Fig. 5S),
•	 lack of wind is conducive to the formation of fog, i.e., no clear plume is observed (samples 27, 30),
•	 wind speed > 30 km/h causes rapid pollutant dispersion and the formation of a plume consistent with the 
predominant wind direction (samples 1, 2),
•	 organic pollutant dispersion is largely affected by low (negative) temperatures, which considerably enlarge the 
TVOC and HCHO dispersion plumes (samples 19, 20, 21).

alternative and municipal waste fuels analyzed in the study have been presented in Fig. 5. Based on this data, we 
found that in the case of:

bustion of such materials as coal pellets, straw or green waste (AF),

Health risk associated with inhalation of polluted air
Health risk assessment relies on several key assumptions. These are based on toxicological testing carried out for 
individual substances43. Due to the fact that we did not measure the concentrations of individual constituents 
of PM2.5, PM10 and TVOC, and the registered values pertain to the entire group of compounds, it was not 
possible to carry out a full health risk assessment using generally accepted equations. This analysis could only be 
performed for formaldehyde (HCHO). Nevertheless, to assess the impact of the other parameters on the health 
of local inhabitants, we used the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the recommended limit values.
Formaldehyde
We calculated the carcinogenic health risk associated with the presence of formaldehyde in the air, following 
the combustion of various fuels, for two age groups: children and adults (“Health Risk Assessment” section). As 
mentioned in the method description, we assumed that children spend only 2 h a day outside during the heating 
season, whereas adults 5 h a day, which is related to e.g., the need to remove snow from the area around homes 
and to perform agricultural work associated with the late (autumn) harvesting of agricultural crops.
The obtained CR values for children and adults at all sampling points ranged as follows: 7.80E-04–1.04E-01 
and 6.50E-05–2.60E-02, respectively (Table S1). Values denoting low or negligible risk (CR < 10–6) were not 
observed for any of the substances combusted (although at several points, the level of pollutants was below the 
detection limit of the sensor). In turn, CR of 10–6–10–4 (uncertain risk) accounted for 77% of the values obtained 
for adults and 47.5% for children. Substances posing an uncertain risk during combustion were oak wood, straw, 
coal and wood pellets and green waste. CR > 10–4 denoting an unacceptable carcinogenic risk accounted for 23% 
and 52% of the values obtained for adults and children, respectively. These values pertained to the combustion 
of mixed municipal waste (samples 19 and 21) and PVC packaging, polystyrene, rubber, artificial leather and 
textiles. The combustion of polystyrene and rubber posed the highest health risk for adults. We found that the 
combustion of polystyrene generated the highest CR values of 1.04E-01 (children) and 2.60E-02 (adults). Such 
high values not only call for corrective action, but also point to the need of expanding research about the impact 
of this practice on other environmental components67.
Non-carcinogenic risk (HQ) calculated for formaldehyde fell within the range of 0.51–203 (adults) and 0.51–
814 (children). Only 33% and 15% of the values (for adults and children, respectively) met the methodologically 
assumed recommendation of HQ ≤ 1. It is concerning that 2% and 11% of the HQ values exceeded 100 and, 
in the case of children, 1% of the values exceeded 500. This occurred during the combustion of polystyrene 
and upholstery foam. This is not an unprecedented result in the scientific literature. Values as high as these 
(HQ = 214.2 for < 2 year-old children and HQ = 51.8 for 2–6 year-old children) have been reported by Li et al.68, 
who studied HCOH in indoor environments.
TVOC
We compared our measurements of TVOC concentrations in the air with relevant legal recommendations. 
However, the proposed limit values for TVOC refer to indoor air quality69. The first limit value 0.3 mg/m3 was 
proposed by Seifert70. However, it had not been determined based on toxicological studies. Another limit value 
was proposed in 200769. It was extended in terms of assessing the level of pollution with these compounds, as it 
presented five pollution levels and specific recommendations to be taken when such pollution occurs. However, 
it still did not address health risks.
Referring to these 5 levels of pollution—and their corresponding limit values of (mg/m3): < 0.3 (level I), 
0.3–1(level II), > 1–3 (level III), > 3–10 (level IV) and > 10–25 (level V), we determined that the maximum value 
of 0.3 mg/m3 points to a minimal presence of volatile organic compounds and the situation does not require 
any corrective measures to be taken. The Chinese legislation53 recommends the value of 0.6 mg/m3, which is 
considerably (two times) higher.
Air quality index—PM2.5 and PM10
The next step in the study involved the parametric assessment of air quality at the six sampling points. For this 
purpose, we calculated the Air Quality Index (AQI), as it is the easiest way to determine air pollution levels. The 
AQI values range between 0 and 500, and the higher the index, the more polluted the air. Our assessment was 
based on the particulate matter levels (PM2.5 and PM10), but it can also include other pollutants, i.e., SOx, NOx, 
CO, COx and O3, C6H6. AQIs for individual pollutants are calculated based on hourly concentrations of these 
compounds and assigned to a relevant category presented in the table of AQI ranges (Table 4). Next, the overall 
index takes the value of the worst individual index among the pollutants measured.
The analysis showed that according to the Polish and European classification, air quality (AQI) during 
the combustion of all the materials analyzed was very poor (n = 12) or extremely poor (n = 19) (Tab. 4). The 
exception was a sample of materials marked with number 18 (mixed municipal waste I), whose combustion 
resulted in medium AQI. Very poor AQI was obtained for all alternative fuels (coal pellets, straw, wood pellets, 
leaves and green waste). This means that pollution generated by burning these materials is so high that patients, 
the elderly, pregnant women, and small children should avoid staying outside and other people should minimize 
outdoor activity. Long-term inhalation exposure to air of quality like this increases the risk of changes in the 
respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems.
Extremely poor AQI was found for all species of wood and the majority of coals and mixed municipal waste. 
Extremely poor air quality was also observed for nearly all fractions of municipal waste, except for paper and 
cardboard packaging, whose combustion resulted in very poor air quality. Inhalation exposure to very poor air

www.nature.com/scientificreports/quality can lead to health problems, such as disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems. 
Outdoor activities should be limited to the necessary minimum.
The American (US values, Table 4) and Chinese legislation (CN values) is slightly different from the legal 
solutions adopted in Europe, and thus in Poland (which is an EU Member State), in terms of measurement 
ranges. Of these, the EU regulations are the most restrictive. The good, fair and moderate AQI ranges are identical 
in the US and EU law, but significantly different in the CN legislation. In turn, the EU legislation is much more 
restrictive with regard to the poor, very poor and extremely poor AQI ranges as compared to the provisions in 
the US and CN (which are nearly identical), which is reflected in the final AQI assessment.
Air quality determined based on the CN criteria would be medium for 5 samples, poor for 13 samples, very 
poor for 13 samples and extremely poor for 1 sample (Table 4). According to the US criteria, AQI would be poor 
for 19 samples, very poor for 12 samples and extremely poor for 1 sample. As for the EU legislation (assigning 
the class according to the highest value of any parameter), AQI would be very poor for 4 samples and extremely 
poor for the other 28 samples.
The general conclusion stemming from this data is that all the solid fuels (hard coal), alternative fuels (coal 
pellets, pellets, wood) and municipal waste (mixed or selected fractions) analyzed in the study emit substantial 
amounts of PM2.5 and PM10 when combusted in household furnaces, which results in very poor or extremely 
poor air quality in the surrounding area. It should be stressed that the study had several limitations such as the 
existing climatic conditions, the terrain and the selected groups of materials (n = 32) subjected to combustion. 
Undoubtedly, the parameters of the furnace used in the study also significantly determined the study results.
Conclusion
In light of the research hypotheses, we found that:
•	 each type of fuel (AF, CF, AFw) combusted in a household furnace is a source of air pollutants, especially fine 
PM2.5 particles, which are harmful to human health,
•	 combustion of municipal waste in household furnaces is a substantial source of organic air pollutants (TVOC 
and HCHO) and thus constitutes a dangerous exposure source to people living in nearby areas,
•	 it is vital to stop burning such materials as polystyrene, rubber and upholstery foam in household furnaces 
due to the drastically high health risk associated with this practice,
•	 in rural areas, solid fuel combustion is a significant factor deteriorating the chemical condition of soils, espe­
cially those used for agricultural purposes.
•	 Furthermore, the study showed that research on this subject should be continued and extended to include 
detailed identification of individual particulate matter and VOC constituents, which would allow for calcu­
lating the overall health risk.
Despite the existing knowledge and legal regulations, the economic and political situation may prompt people to 
use waste for energy purposes. The data presented in the paper undoubtedly make an important contribution to 
the discussion on expanding and increasing the share of renewable sources in energy production in rural areas. 
The solution to the existing situation is to develop a model for managing renewable energy resources in such a 
way that individual energy sources are used most efficiently, with the least social cost and in accordance with the 
assumptions of sustainable development and environmental policies.

Association between sugar cane burning and
acute respiratory illness on the island of Maui
Christina Louise Mnatzaganian1*, Karen L. Pellegrin2, Jill Miyamura3, Diana Valencia4 and Lorrin Pang5
Abstract
Background: Sugar cane harvesting by burning on Maui island is an environmental health issue due to respiratory
effects of smoke. Volcanic smog (“vog”) from an active volcano on a neighboring island periodically blankets Maui
and could confound a study of cane smoke’s effects since cane burning is not allowed on vog days. This study
examines the association between cane burning and emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and
prescription fills for acute respiratory illnesses.
Methods: This retrospective study controlled for confounders that could increase respiratory distress on non-burn
days by matching each burn day with a non-burn day and then comparing the ratio of patients with respiratory
distress residing in the path of sugar burn smoke to those residing elsewhere on Maui on burn versus non-burn
days. Patients with acute respiratory distress were defined as those with one or more acute respiratory diagnoses at
one of the hospitals or emergency departments on Maui. Separately, patients with acute respiratory illness were
identified through prescription records from four community pharmacies, specifically defined as those who filled
prescriptions for acute respiratory distress.
Results: There were 1,256 reports of respiratory distress prescriptions and 686 hospital/ED diagnoses of acute
respiratory illness. The ratio of cases within to outside of smoke exposure was higher on burn days for both the
ED/hospital data and the pharmacy, though not statistically significant. In post-hoc analyses of the pharmacy data
based on the number of acres burned as a proxy for volume of smoke, there was a dose response trend for
acreage burned such that the highest quartile showed a statistically significant higher proportion of acute
respiratory distress in the exposed versus non-exposed regions (P = 0.015, OR 2.4, 95 % CI [1.2–4.8]).
Conclusions: After adjusting for confounders on non-burn days, there was a significantly higher incidence of
respiratory distress in smoke-exposed regions when greater amounts of acres were burned. Health officials should
consider actions to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with sugar cane burning practices.

Background
Outdoor air pollution is associated with mortality and
hospital admissions due to respiratory and cardiovascu-
lar disease in both short-term and long-term studies [1].
There is a paucity of research on the specific impact of
sugar cane burning on health, despite evidence that it is
at least as toxic as pollution produced by traffic and
more toxic than traffic after repeated exposures [2, 3]. In
particular, no published studies have examined the
impact of current sugar cane burning practices on the
island of Maui in Hawaii.
Sugar plantations were established two centuries ago
on the islands of Hawaii. Today, only the island of Maui
continues to produce 200,000 tons of cane annually [4].
Controlled, scheduled burns of cane fields occur prior to
harvest to reduce the volume of waste material for trans-
port and processing. Cane field fires produce smoke and
ash above the Maui central valley resulting in ash fall
locally known as “Maui snow”. Burns typically begin in
the early morning hours and end before dawn, thereby

Burning rules are set and monitored by the Hawaii
Department of Health (DOH). Burning is prohibited on
days when high amounts of volcanic smog (“vog”)
occur on Maui, originating from the consistently-active
Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii, located
117 miles southeast of Maui. There is a general north-
easterly wind direction during days when cane burning
is allowed. When vog blows in on weaker southerly
winds, it tends to uniformly expose Maui’s entire island
population. Therefore, vog could confound clinical/
epidemiologic studies of cane burning’s respiratory effects
if one used days of no cane burning as controls for days of
burning. Additionally, cane cannot be burned during
extremely rainy weather, which is associated with cold
symptoms, another potential confounder. Therefore, com-
parisons of burn versus non-burn days on Maui require
methods that control for at least these confounders.
The study of sugar cane burning on Maui is a particu-
larly important environmental health issue given the
relatively high prevalence of asthma in Hawaii. Accord-
ing to the National Center for Environmental Health,
asthma affects 16.9 % of children and 16.1 % of adults in
Hawaii, higher than the US prevalence of 12.5 % and
13.3 %, respectively [5, 6]. Asthma exacerbations have
continually contributed to increasing emergency de-
partment (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and mortality [7].
Hawaii reports approximately 5,000 ED visits and 1,500
hospital admissions annually due to asthma exacerba-
tions [8]. According to the National Institute of Health,
environmental factors that may trigger or exacerbate
acute respiratory illnesses include viral respiratory in-
fections, environmental allergens, smoking, exercise,
occupational chemicals, environmental changes, irri-
tants, emotions, stress, drugs, food, changes in weather,
exposure to cold air, and endocrine and comorbid con-
ditions [9]. Cane burning and vog emissions are typical
examples of smoke, chemical, and particulates on Maui.
Additionally, residents may be exposed to molds and
viral infections during extremely wet and rainy weather
when cane burning is not permitted.
There are only a few published studies to date that
examine the health effects of sugar cane burning and none
examining health effects under current DOH burning re-
strictions in the unique environment of Hawaii. Lehman
studied 36 patients who were scheduled for intracutaneous
skin testing due to significant chronic allergy problems.
When exposed to sugar cane smoke extract, there was a
significant increase (P < 0.01) in positive skin reactions in
subjects exposed to cane smoke extract as compared to
the control group [10]. In Louisiana, there were 6,498 hos-
pital visitations for asthma during a two-year study period
with a positive (though not significant) dose–response
trend in asthma hospitalization rates during sugar cane
burning [11].
Brazilian studies demonstrate an association with ad-
verse health effects. One study analyzed 673 records of
children less than thirteen years old and elderly greater
than 64 years old and found particulate matter (PM) and
carbon monoxide (CO) markers from cane burning led
to respiratory effects [12]. Data analysis showed that the
PM10 during the nonburning period was 28.9 ± 12.8 μg/m3
compared to 87.7 ± 57.9 μg/m3 during the burning
period. The PM2.5 during the nonburning period was
10.0 ± 4.6 μg/m3 compared to 22.8 ± 14.7 μg/m3 during
the burning period. In both the child and elderly group,
PM10, PM2.5, and black carbon were significantly asso-
ciated with respiratory hospital admissions even after
adjusting for season and weather. These correlations
remained significant even after adjusting for season
and weather.
In another ecological time-series study, total sus-
pended particle (TSP) concentrations from cane burning
doubled during burn periods with a statistically signifi-
cant increase in asthma hospital admissions 1–5 days
after increasing TSP concentrations [13]. Study authors
used a lag structure of 0 to 9 days between burn dates
and hospital admissions with adjustments for over-
dispersion. During the 493 days of the study, there were
a total of 640 asthma hospital admissions; during the
burning period (318 days) there were 477 admissions, a
rate 50 % higher, and statistically significant, compared
to
163
admissions
during
the
non-burning
period
(175 days).
In a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 1,076 private-
and public-schooled children aged 10–14, Riguera found
lower asthma symptoms but higher rates of rhinitis in
children during times of burning [14]. Through a series
of assessments, he found that the prevalence of asthma
and rhinitis symptoms was 11 % and 33.2 %, respect-
ively. Rhinitis occurred most frequently from June to
October, a period that matches the sugar cane harvest
season in Brazil as well as seasonal variations. Addition-
ally, daily prevalence of peak expiratory flow below 20 %
of the median of each child’s best measurements was
greater in days with higher PM2.5 concentrations. The
authors concluded that the prevalence of asthma symp-
toms was actually below the national Brazilian average
(19 %) whereas rhinitis prevalence exceeded the national
average (29.6 %) during the study period.
More recently, there is evidence that reduction of pre-
harvest sugar cane burning in response to a state law in
Brazil requiring the gradual elimination of this practice
has been associated with a decrease in hospitalizations
due to respiratory disease [15].
In 1972, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) studied cane and leaf burning from Hawaii
Mnatzaganian et al. Environmental Health  (2015) 14:81 
Page 2 of 8crops in an incinerating tower for pollutant analysis [16].
Burning of 20 whole cane plots and 19 cane leaf trash
samples
yielded
particulates,
carbon
monoxide,
and
hydrocarbon emissions all within normal ranges of many
other herbaceous types of fuel previously burned within
the tower. During whole cane burns, particulate yields
averaged 112 lbs/acre of fuel burned (99 % CI with true
mean between 92 and 132 lbs/acre), which was deter-
mined to not be excessive. The carbon monoxide yield
averaged 1,113 lbs/acre (99 % CI with true mean between
843 and 1,383 lbs/acre), and also determined to be a
moderate amount emitted, similar to the yield from dry
cereal grain straw. Finally, the hydrocarbon yield averaged
152 lbs/acre (99 % CI with true mean of 121 lbs/acre) and
authors concluded this also to be within normal emis-
sions. Pollutant yields from leaf trash were a little less than
from whole cane; additionally, those fires simulated
against the direction of wind flow did not emit any signifi-
cant difference compared those in the direction of wind
flow. However, this marker study does not address all pol-
lutants potentially causing health problems or examine if
mixtures of pollutants have a compounding effect. For
example, vog is another source of air pollution on Maui
and was studied at a clinic downwind from the active vol-
cano on the Big Island of Hawaii [17]. In sampling 1,189
patients, high vog exposure during increased volcanic ac-
tivity was associated with a six-fold increase in health
visits for acute airway problems, cough, headache, and
pharyngitis.
Given the link between sugar cane burning and nega-
tive respiratory health outcomes in other locations, the
high prevalence of asthma in Hawaii, and the complex
environment in Hawaii, it is important to study the im-
pact of current sugar burning practices on Maui. There-
fore, this study retrospectively examines the relationship
between sugar cane
burning and acute respiratory
illnesses on the island of Maui on burn days while con-
trolling for confounding factors likely to be present on
non-burn days.
Methods
Study design
This study used a historical, controlled (paired), and par-
tially blinded design to compare the ratio of respiratory
distress events among those residing in the path of sugar
cane burn smoke to those residing elsewhere on Maui
on burn versus non-burn days. This design controls for
confounding variables (e.g., vog and rain) on the non-
burn days. The ratio of cases from smoke exposure area
to non-exposed areas was hypothesized to be higher on
burn days compared to non-burn days. The Institutional
Review Boards of the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii
DOH granted ethical approval.
Data sources
Cane burning records between April 2011-April 2012
were obtained from the DOH. This period was selected
because cane employees used a newer, detailed system of
reporting information with spot-check confirmation by
DOH personnel. Investigators selected 55 burn days
where burning was completed by 6:00 AM (to ensure
residential exposures only), more than 70 acres were
burned, and uniform wind speed greater than zero. Each
burn day was matched with a random non-burn day that
was preceded by at least four days of no burning as a
“washout” period.
DOH field maps and Google Earth software were then
utilized to identify areas where burning occurred. The
sugar cane company maps and numbers all cane fields
so the burn location and acreage is available in records
submitted to the DOH. Investigators plotted the site of
the burn and drew a cone of smoke exposure based on
the averaged wind directions with a 30 degree angle of
smoke dispersion. This angle was determined from ob-
servations of smoke from the sugar mill during a variety
of wind conditions as well as previously conducted re-
search [18]. Areas of exposure were drawn to the edge
of the island.
Respiratory distress events on selected burn and non-
burn dates were obtained from two sources: a database
of all hospital admissions and all ED visits on Maui and
four community pharmacies on Maui. Hospital admis-
sion and ED data pertaining to acute respiratory disease
were obtained from Hawaii Health Information Corpor-
ation (HHIC). HHIC collects, cleans, and verifies de-
tailed patient-level discharge data from hospitals for all
payers in the state of Hawaii. HHIC data elements in-
clude patient race/ethnicity, age, gender, insurer, length
of stay, patient residence, and primary and secondary
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision
(ICD-9) diagnostic codes. Specifically, the following dis-
charges and ED visits were obtained from HHIC on
selected burn and non-burn days: asthma with exacer-
bation (ICD-9 493.02), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 466.0),
acute sinusitis (ICD-9 461), acute pharyngitis including
streptococcal pharyngitis (ICD-9 462; 034.0), acute con-
junctivitis (ICD-9 372.0), cough (ICD-9 786.2), head-
ache (ICD-9 339), all pneumonias (ICD-9 480–486),
and other acute airway problems (requiring immediate
treatment such as oxygen, medications, or respiratory
treatments, ICD-9 786.05).
Databases of prescriptions filled from four commu-
nity pharmacies in four different regions (representing
13 % of the pharmacies on Maui) were queried for the
following medications used to treat respiratory condi-
tions: albuterol, ipratropium, and albuterol/ipratropium
inhalers and nebulizers, nasal sprays including flu-
ticasone, mometasone, and flunisolide, promethazine/

and
200 mg), prednisone tablets (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg),
methylprednisolone dose-packs, and medications for
conjunctivitis including prednisolone, olopatadine, and
prednisolone eye drops.
For each respiratory distress event (i.e., hospital admis-
sion, ED visit, prescription filled), the patient’s home ad-
dress was obtained. Patients with residences outside of
Maui were excluded, and those with multiple qualifying
diagnoses or prescriptions were counted as one exposure.
For each burn day and matched non-burn day, sub-
jects with one or more respiratory distress events were
plotted to reside either in the area of cane smoke ex-
posure or outside of it. To facilitate understanding of
the design, subjects from both burn days and non-burn
days were plotted on the same map (Fig. 1). Data were
tallied across all pairs of days retaining the exposed vs.
non-exposed and burn day vs. non-burn day designa-
tions. A 2x2 Chi-square test was used to compare these
mutually exclusive counts, aggregated across all burn/
non-burn day pairs. An equivalent approach would be
to take the odds ratio (OR) of these two ratios with a
null hypothesis of no effect having this OR (burn day
ratio: non-burn day ratio) = 1.

Page 4 of 8Results
There were 191 burn days from April 2011-April 2012; 55
burn days and 55 matching non-burn days were chosen
based on the criteria previously detailed (Table 1).
Hospital data
Island-wide, there were 315 hospital/ED acute respira-
tory visits on burn days and 371 hospital/ED visits on
non-burn days (N = 686); without any mapping to smoke
exposure versus no exposure there was a significantly
higher (P = 0.04) rate of respiratory illnesses on the days
when cane was not burned (Table 1). However, in the
analyses of exposed vs. non-exposed smoke areas to con-
trol for the confounders on non-burn days, 37 (11.7 %)
of the 315 cases on burn days were exposed compared
to 34 (9.2 %) of the 371 cases from the corresponding
areas during non-burn days (Table 2). This higher pro-
portion of respiratory distress from exposed areas on
burn days was not significant (P = 0.33; RR = 1.28, 95 %
CI [0.82–2.0]).
Pharmacy data
Similar results were found with the pharmacy data.
Island-wide, there were 576 patients who filled respiratory
prescriptions on burn days and 680 subjects who filled
prescriptions on non-burn days (N = 1,256); without map-
ping to smoke exposure areas there was a significantly
higher number during non-burn days (P = 0.0025; RR
1.18, 95 % CI [1.06–1.31]) (Table 1). However, in smoke
exposure mapping analyses of exposed vs. non-exposed
areas to control for confounders on non-burn days, 76
(13.2 %) of the 576 cases on burn days were exposed com-
pared to 78 (11.5 %) of the 680 cases in the corresponding
areas during the non-burn days (Table 2). This greater
proportion of respiratory distress in the area of exposure
on burn days was not statistically significant.
Thus, the hypothesis that the ratio of respiratory dis-
tress events among those inside to outside smoke ex-
posure areas would be greater on burn day than on
non-burn days was not supported with either hospital
data or pharmacy data. To explore the possibility of dose
response in post-hoc analyses, the selected burn days (and
paired non-burn days) were broken down by quartiles ac-
cording to the acreage burned; in essence, into four
smaller studies using data from the community phar-
macies. There was a statistically significant (P = 0.02;
OR = 2.4 (95 % CI [1.2–4.8]) higher proportion of
illness from the smoke exposed areas during the highest
quartile of cane burning based on number of acres
burned. The remaining quartiles did not show statisti-
cally significant differences although the OR trended
downwards as the amount of cane burned decreased by
acreage (1.07, 0.86, 0.74, respectively) (Table 3).
To estimate study power and sample size, with 177
total exposures from each of the burn and non-burn
days one could have detected a shift in cases from 15 to
11 % of total cases in the exposed areas between the
burn and non-burn days, respectively (alpha error of 5 %
and beta of 20 %). With 750 in each group one had the
same power to detect a smaller 15 % to 13 % shift.
Statistical calculations were done using EPIINFO 7.0; if
not specified otherwise, P-values were calculated by
Fishers Exact tests.
Discussion
The use of global positioning system (GPS) mapping
allowed study investigators to compare the ratio of cases
of cane-smoke exposed regions during burning to the
ratio of cases from these same areas when no burning
occurred to isolate the effect of burning. Comparison of
these two ratios adjusted for vog, as well as other
geographical or temporal confounding effects. Without
these adjustments we showed there was significantly
more symptoms on the days when cane was not burned,
which would be expected due to respiratory effects of
vog and the prohibition of burning cane on vog days.

Page 5 of 8With these adjustments there was an increase, although
statistically insignificant, in the proportion of cases from
smoke-exposed areas during days of cane burning. When
this same analysis was repeated by quartiles of acreage of
cane burned as a “dose” effect, there was a trend showing
higher proportions from the smoke-exposed areas when
more cane was burned. The highest quartile showed a sta-
tistically significant higher proportion corresponding to
2.4 fold increase in the expected number of cases and a
dose–response effect by quantity of acreage burned.
When studying the health impact of cane burning, the
typical design would tally all acute symptoms associated
with a burn event and compare to control periods with
no cane smoke exposure. It is typically assumed that
most or all of the acute symptoms caused by cane burning
occur temporally near the burn event. When symptoms
(or the measurable events reflecting the symptoms) might
lag the burn event by a few days, designs must account for
this potential lag to ensure that the control period isn’t
“contaminated” with lagged effects from the burn event.
In this study, control periods were chosen to account for
this potential lag in symptoms by selecting non-burn days
that were preceded by at least four days of no burning.
Similarly, designs that limit measurement of acute symp-
toms to the day of the burn event risk missing lagged
symptoms that are caused by the event. While this ap-
proach was used in this study and represents a limitation,
measuring symptoms in the first 24 h after exposure was
believed to be the best way to capture most of those
caused by the burn event while minimizing the inclusion
of symptoms due to other causes.
A unique challenge to designing research on the health
impact of cane burning on Maui is that burning is
intentionally avoided on “voggy” days. Thus, simply
comparing acute symptoms across the Maui population
on burn versus non-burn days does not isolate the im-
pact of cane burning. That is, the higher vog pollution
on non-burn days potentially masks the impact of cane
burning. Therefore, the design must adjust for vog and
other
potential
confounding
factors.
One
approach
would be to select the control, no-burn days, to have
exactly the same vog effect as the burn days. This is
problematic as the declaration of a “vog day” is very sub-
ject and imprecise, depending on observing haze and the
amount and duration of the haze seen. For a given year,
different agencies report varying percentages of vog days
between 5–20 % for Maui. Additionally, associations
with marker chemical pollutant(s) are not well validated.
Therefore, the method used in this study (ratio of ratios)
is more likely to effectively control for confounders that
potentially affect health island-wide by comparing the
ratio of symptoms in exposed versus non-exposed re-
gions on burn versus non-burn days.
Furthermore, it may appear that the lower two quar-
tiles of acreage burned have a “protective effect” where
areas of smoke exposure have proportionately fewer
cases when looking at the trend effect based on acreage.
It is possible that there is an underrepresentation of out-
comes in all quartiles. Perhaps the methods of measur-
ing respiratory distress only captured more acute events,
so that the impact of burning on indicators of milder re-
spiratory distress (e.g., clinic visits, taking a sick day
from work, and/or general malaise) were not measured.
For example, when the smoke exposure is mild (lower
quartiles), respiratory distress symptoms may be milder,
and subjects take a “wait and see” approach hoping that
the symptoms clear with the smoke. This could result in
lower than normal ED visits, hospital admissions, or pre-
scription fills that day. The following day, the symptoms
either clear or result in case outcomes if they don’t re-
solve; thus a lag-effect may exist. Our method only de-
tected symptoms on the day of the burning and would
miss second-day delayed visits and/or more mild distress
if they occurred.
While we controlled for the effect of vog and rain more
likely to occur on non-burn days, our study design can
address other confounders like “healthy survivor” effect
where residents relocate to another part of the island to
avoid the vog as well as disproportionate pharmacy cover-
age across a geographical area. The strength of the meth-
odology is that the adjustments occur without actually
knowing the degree of confounding or even identifying
that a confounder exists. This is analogous to having an
individual be his own control, which adjusts for known
and unknown confounders, measured or not. For small

Page 6 of 8communities requiring a rapid assessment of outdoor pol-
lution sources, this method should be considered. This
method requires that the targeted confounding effect oc-
curs either uniformly geographically (vog, pollen, or mold)
or persists over time (pharmacy coverage, healthy survivor
effect, etc.). An alternative approach to adjusting for con-
founders may involve mathematical modeling (regres-
sions, etc.). In order to do this, one must measure the
confounding effect upon which to build the model. For ef-
fects like vog, this may be difficult since there are a variety
of irritants, acting alone and in combinations, and clinical
effects may persist beyond the actual detection period
of the polluting chemicals in the air. However, our
design of comparing morbidity of self-matched groups
offers a simple way to adjust for confounders without
actually knowing the markers or the magnitude of their
effects. Perhaps a stratified analysis on the matched
case–control pairs would have offered more precision
but it is not clear how much more these statistical
methods would have added [19].
Given the accumulation of data showing the negative
health impact from air pollution in general and sugar
cane burning specifically, public health officials should
consider actions to minimize this impact. This study
suggests that limiting the number of acres burned on a
given day might significantly reduce acute respiratory
distress among those residing in exposed areas. It is
noteworthy that in Brazil, where most of the studies of
sugar cane burning impact have been conducted, one
state has passed a law requiring the gradual elimination
of pre-harvest burning. Preliminary results indicate that
this has resulted in improvements in respiratory health
[15]. While economic interests are often of concern with
such actions, economic evaluations should include all
likely impacts, including cost of associated healthcare,
productivity, and quality of life. On Maui, where tourism
is the dominant economic engine, impact on visitors
should also be considered.
Conclusions
These results provide additional evidence of the harmful
effects of sugar cane burning on respiratory functioning,
specifically a “dose” response based on the number of
acres burned as an indicator of volume of smoke. Maui
is a small island with a complex environment that
includes vog and other potential triggers of respiratory
distress. New technologies may offer better detection of
chemical markers of pollution; however, this study dem-
onstrated that modern technology of satellite mapping
can help control for confounders. While additional
research will advance scientific understanding of the
relationship between air pollution and health, public
health officials should consider taking action based on
the accumulation of research to date.

Abstract
Background: Since July 2015, Lebanon has been experiencing a waste management crisis. Dumpsites in inhabited
areas and waste burning have emerged due to the waste accumulation, further adding to the gravity of the situation.
However, the association between the crisis and health of the population has not been scientifically reported.
Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to assess whether exposure to open dumpsites and
waste burning is associated with acute health symptoms. The study sample included 221 male workers between the
ages of 18–60 years selected from two areas chosen based on their proximity to a garbage dumpsite and waste
burning. 110 workers were exposed to a garbage dumpsite and waste burning, and 111 workers were not. Data
were collected via a face-to-face interview using a newly developed validated structured questionnaire. Chi-square
tests were used to check for statistically significant differences between exposure and covariates. Multivariable analyses
using multiple logistic regression were used to compare health symptoms between exposed and unexposed workers
adjusting for potential confounders.
Results: The prevalence of acute health symptoms was greater among the exposed workers than the non-exposed
workers, including gastrointestinal, respiratory, dermatological and constitutional symptoms. Controlling for
confounding variables, such as age, insurance, family support, residence near dumpsite, work site, and smoking, a
minimum odds ratio (OR) of 4.30 was obtained when comparing the exposed population to those non-exposed.
Conclusion: The strong association between improper waste management and physical health calls for immediate
attention by the government, stakeholders and community members to find optimal solutions for this waste
management crisis and set immediate priority interventions such as regular waste collection, volume reduction and
recycling performance improvement. However, the long recall period may have underestimated our results.
Keywords: Waste, Waste management, Dumpsites, Waste burning, Physical health, Workers
Background
From July 17, 2015 till end of September, heaps of garbage
crowded the residential areas and streets in Lebanon.
Civic protests broke out throughout the country calling
for a clean-up of the streets and asking for a permanent
solution to the waste management dilemma the country
has been facing for years [1]. Temporary solutions were
made, eventually resulting in the reemergence of the crisis
in August 2016. Due to the lack of a proper national re-
cycling plan, waste management remains as one of the
most challenging development-related issues that the
government is facing. Historically, municipalities have
managed disposal and refuse collection. As a conse-
quence of civil unrest, municipalities have been unable
to provide a much needed service and until recently
slow burning and uncontrolled dumping on hillsides
and seashores, particularly in industrial areas such as
Dawra and Dekwaneh, have become common practices

DOI 10.1186/s12940-017-0240-6for solid waste disposal in Lebanon resulting in serious
land, sea and air pollution problems [2].
The change in weather conditions and prolonged
duration of the crisis reached a critical stage, resulting
in multiple claims regarding health implications and
infectious illnesses, including accumulation and leakage of
toxins into water sources and spreading of pathogens in-
cluding, but not limited to, Vibrio cholerae and hepatitis
[3]. While leakage into water sources can be compensated
by a high-quality water system, this leakage, however,
could be concerning given the inefficient water system in
Lebanon. Municipal water supplied to households in
Lebanon was reported to be turbid, possibly because of
infrequent monitoring of the municipal water quality [4].
Improper
disposal
of
garbage,
specifically
burning
wastes in the open, poses serious danger on health. Some
of the most dangerous pollutants emitted are dioxins, par-
ticle pollution, carbon monoxide and volatile organic
compounds. Dioxins are persistent, bio-accumulative and
toxic pollutants that settle on plants, thus building up in
the food chain and resulting in harmful effects. Some of
the adverse effects of dioxins include suppression of im-
mune systems, disruption on hormonal system and cancer
[5–7]. Particle pollutants are microscopic particles that
can aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma and
bronchitis and are associated with cardiac arrhythmias
and heart attacks. Carbon monoxide can cause neurologic
symptoms in people exposed to significant burning of gar-
bage; these symptoms include headache, fatigue, nausea
and vomiting. Inhaling volatile organic compounds can
cause headaches, loss of coordination, nausea, damage to
the liver, kidney and central nervous system and irritation
to the eye, nose and throat. Hence, the broad spectrum of
adverse effects caused by emission of these compounds
into the atmosphere calls for serious restructuring of
waste management in Lebanon [8].
Current research indicates that burning wastes can
increase the risk of heart disease, aggravate respiratory
ailments such as asthma and emphysema and cause
rashes, nausea, headaches or diarrhea, damages in the
nervous system, kidney or liver, in the reproductive system
and development system [9, 10]. For instance, burning of
polystyrene polymers, such as foam cups or meat trays,
releases styrene gas that is absorbed through the skin
and lungs, resulting in harmful effects ranging from a
spectrum of acute symptoms to severe life-changing
problems [5]. Moreover, the acid and chemicals emitted
by trash fires can cause severe bronchoconstriction in
asthmatics [11]. Other long-term effects caused by ex-
posure to a landfill include congenital abnormalities
and malformations [12].
In Lebanon, waste accumulation on the streets and
other sites has led to the emergence of unlicensed landfills
and dumpsites in inhabited areas [3]. Improper waste
management is a public health concern with a large
spectrum of outcomes. However, data concerning the
magnitude of the ongoing waste crisis, such as the preva-
lence of acute health symptoms resulting from improper
waste management, is still scarce and has not been scien-
tifically reported. This study aimed to assess whether ex-
posure to dump sites and waste burning is associated with
poor physical health, defined by the occurrence of acute
health symptoms. Acute symptoms have a rapid onset and
a short course. It includes, but is not limited to, general
systemic symptoms such as nausea, skin allergies, dyspnea
– shortness of breath – and asthma attacks.
Methods
Research design
A comparative cross-sectional study of 221 male workers
aged 18–60 years was conducted in the northern suburbs
of the capital city.
A total of 110 participants was taken from workplaces
in Dawra, a region in the Northern suburbs of the capital
Beirut, characterized by patriarchal industrial areas, and in
proximity (100 m radius) of a major open dump, where
the waste burning also occurred. A comparison group of
111 workers was taken from Dekwaneh, another industrial
area in the suburbs of Beirut, close to Dawra and where
no garbage dump existed within a 100 m radius. Workers
who have been working in the chosen industrial areas of
similar composition for at least 3 months were inter-
viewed. Foreign workers, mentally handicapped and phys-
ically disabled workers were excluded to minimize any
communication problems.
A walk-through survey method was adopted to select
a random sample of workers in each of the two areas.
All consecutive shops (mechanic, electrician, retail of
auto spare parts, companies such as BOSCH) in the
blocks were selected. Upon consent of the employer to
approach his/her employees, the investigators inquired
from the employees whose birthdays were closest to the
date of interview and selected him. The research team
member(s) filled out the structured questionnaire ac-
cordingly on behalf of the selected employees.
Measures
We defined acute symptoms as those that have a rapid
onset and a short course; the outcomes encompassed
22 physical symptoms from major systems, including
non-specific constitutional symptoms. These systems
included the gastrointestinal systems, integumentary
system/skin, and upper respiratory system. Other con-
stitutional symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and
headache were noted as well.
Indicators for the acute symptoms included the pres-
ence of the symptoms based on a recall period of 2
Morsi et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:39 
Page 2 of 6months prior to the interview, duration, severity, treat-
ment, and absence from work (in days).
Other co-variates included the socioeconomic charac-
teristics of workers (age, educational level, marital status,
occupation, income sufficiency, and health insurance
status); exposure related variables such as working site
(indoors or outdoors), residency area (whether there is a
garbage dump present in the vicinity of their residence)
and the use of protective measures (eg. mask, etc.); health-
related variables including presence of chronic conditions
such as diabetes, asthma, cancer, and smoking status.
Data collection
After gaining consent from the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) at the American University of Beirut, data
were collected from the participants through a struc-
tured questionnaire. The employer was first approached
to take permission for interviewing the workers. Upon
his approval, the workers were then randomly selected
based on the last-birthday sampling method, where the
available employees were called upon by the employer
and were asked for their birthdays. If the employer re-
fused to give consent, then no replacement of the shop
was made. The employees with the birthdays closest to
the date of interview at the time being were selected for
the study, and the research team member(s) asked for
the employees’ verbal consent. Upon consenting, the re-
search team member(s) proceeded with surveying each
worker in a more private place in the shop or office,
avoiding any third person not directly involved with the
face-to-face interview or research team.
Data analysis
We analyzed the quantitative data using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v.23. The survey re-
sults were summarized and presented as the percentage
of participants who had a response to each statement.
Frequency distributions and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were calculated to estimate relevant prevalence
rates of acute symptoms.
All co-variates were cross-tabulated with exposure status
and Chi-square tests performed to check for statistically
significant differences. The presence of acute symptoms
was compared according to exposure status. Unadjusted
ORs and their 95% confidence intervals were reported.
The symptoms chosen for multivariable analysis were
based on the number of outcomes per symptom and their
significance. The adjusted ORs for each symptom were
then calculated using multiple logistic regression including
the confounding variables found to significantly affect the
data at the bivariate level. Finally, bivariate analysis was
conducted to compare the distribution of acute conditions
between the exposed sample and the non-exposed sample.
Non-parametric tests such as Mann–Whitney U test were
then used to confirm whether there was an association
between exposure to waste and the distribution of
symptoms. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the participants by
exposure status. The two groups were similar with respect
to age, education, marital status, work shift duration, and
income sufficiency. Exposed workers were more likely
than non-exposed to be living near a dumpsite (42.7% vs
22.7%), and to work indoors (48.2% vs. 26.1) and to be the
main support to their family (81.0% vs. 65.5%).
With regard to the health-related demographic charac-
teristics, the majority of both non-exposed and exposed
workers did not have a chronic disease, such as diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, etc. A significantly higher pro-
portion of exposed workers were smokers (61.8% vs.
45.9%). The majority of both non-exposed and exposed
workers had insurance.
Prevalence of acute physical symptoms with exposure to
waste
Multivariable analysis was used to control for the poten-
tial confounders that were found to be significant with
exposure and outcomes at the bivariate level. These con-
founders included residence near a dumpsite, place of
work (indoors, outdoors, or both), family support and
smoking status. Age and insurance were also controlled
for, to minimize any effect on their association with the
workers’ physical health.
Table 2 shows the results of different logistic regression
models for the association between each acute physical
symptom and exposure to waste, after adjusting for con-
founders. Workers exposed to waste burning and dump
sites have significantly greater odds of having fatigue
(OR = 22.48; 95% CI 9.34–54.09), headache (OR = 16.88;
95% CI 7.85–36.31), and insomnia (OR = 10.64; 95% CI
3.09–36.67) among general constitutive symptoms. Exposed
workers also have greater odds of gastrointestinal manifes-
tations, including nausea (OR = 9.72; 95% CI 4.74–19.92),
diarrhea (OR = 4.30; 95% CI 1.65–11.18), and vomiting
(OR = 4.74; 95% CI 1.53–14.68). Being exposed was also
significantly associated with respiratory symptoms, includ-
ing dyspnea (OR = 14.99; 95% CI 6.60–34.01), sneezing
(OR = 24.75; 95% CI 8.41–72.80), dry cough (OR = 9.57;
95% CI 4.03–22.70), sputum (OR = 8.79; 95% CI 3.23–
23.94), and rhinorrhea (OR = 6.00; 95% CI 2.48–14.56).
Moreover, the median number of symptoms for exposed
workers was greater than that of non-exposed workers
(1 vs. 4). An independent-samples Mann–Whitney U test
showed that there was a statistically significant difference
between the underlying distributions of symptoms in ex-
posed workers as opposed to non-exposed workers.

Page 3 of 6Severity of acute physical symptoms among both exposed
and non-exposed workers
Nausea, headache and diarrhea were chosen to estimate
the severity of the symptoms among the exposure group,
out of all the symptoms found to be significant and with
prevalence greater than 10%. Around half of those ex-
posed reporting headaches took medication (45.1%),
while around 80% of those not exposed reporting head-
aches took medication. Those exposed who reported
nausea had leaves of absence ranging from zero to
30 days, while those not exposed who reported nausea
did not take any leaves of absence. Additionally, around
a quarter of exposed workers who reported diarrhea
visited doctors; around one-tenth of these individuals
took leaves of absence. On the other hand, around five
percent of those non-exposed who reported diarrhea
visited doctors, and none of these individuals took any
leave of absence.
Discussion
The results from this comparative cross-sectional study
showed that exposure to open waste dump is associated
with a greater likelihood of acute symptoms. These
results are consistent with the claims mentioned on the
health implications that the improper waste manage-
ment could result in, such as an increased risk of asthma
and increased rate of hospitalization due to respiratory
and gastrointestinal manifestations [3].
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been
conducted on the association between garbage exposure
and physical health of workers during the waste crisis
that extended from July till end of September 2015.
Most of the claims were not based on scientific evidence.
Moreover, it is the first study documenting and analyzing
the type of symptoms occurring as well as the severity.
These findings reinforce the negative implications of im-
proper waste management as suggested by other findings
in regards to exposure to carcinogenic air toxins such as
dioxins linked to diseases like lymphomas, leukemias, and
heart disease [13].
This is a rigorous epidemiological study controlling
for many potential confounders. One potential variable
that was not taken into account is the installment and
usage of ventilation systems. We also minimized recall
bias by coinciding data collection with the waste crisis.
However, a two-month recall period may have underes-
timated the prevalence and duration of reported symp-
toms or may have affected the reported data related to
medication. Other strengths included selecting a sam-
ple of adequate representation of the working popula-
tion, and increasing the external validity of the study by
randomly selecting the workers. The working population
chosen was representative of the working Lebanese popu-
lation, given the age and gender of the sample selected.
The socio-demographic characteristics were generally
similar to that of the Lebanese population in regards to
age groups,
smoking, education, marital status and
chronic medical conditions [14].

Page 4 of 6The confidence in the association between garbage
exposure and physical health of workers was affected by
a number of limitations. One limitation was that docu-
menting symptoms was self-reported and based on recall
and not on any objective medical assessment. In addition,
the target population did not include vulnerable age
groups such as children and the elderly, but rather only
included those workers, who were present at the time of
data collection. Moreover, workers who were severely
affected by the crisis may have not been present at the
time of data collection.
Policy implications
Therefore, our study establishes an association of large
magnitude
between
garbage
exposure
and
physical
health. The burden of garbage exposure on physical
health is not the only alarming issue; the garbage exposure
may also have financial implications, which pose as an
economic burden on the Lebanese population. Workers
may have also transmitted the infections to other house-
hold members, and this may be considered a social bur-
den. Hence, this study stresses the importance of taking
strict measures to alleviate any anticipated consequences
of the waste management crisis. Although waste manage-
ment plans are being currently discussed, they are still not
optimal to alleviate the symptoms entirely. Instead, they
might be resulting in shifting the symptoms elsewhere.
Short-term measures to be considered include indus-
trial waste minimization by adopting measures such as
production process modification, volume reduction and
recovery. Each municipality can create well-planned
landfills or incineration sites located more than 10 km
away from inhabited areas, attempt to prevent trash piles
from contaminating water sources, routinely measure
contaminated
water
sources
for
toxins,
implement
awareness campaigns on recycling and health hazards, and
collaborate with the government and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to achieve better outcomes [3]. It is
important to set immediate priority interventions such as
regular waste collection, volume reduction and improve-
ment in recycling performance. On an individual level,
citizens should also be more aware of protective mea-
sures such as recycling, minimizing individual acts of
waste burning, and wearing masks, in order to minimize
the transmission of pathogens.
Long-term measures include establishing a proper
color-coding system for waste segregation, collection,
transportation, storage and providing proper training for
waste handlers; import and export regulatory regimes
should also be established on a policy level as forms of
interventions;
a
regulatory
framework
and
national
guidelines should be established under which regional and
national treatment/disposal polices are to be developed;

Page 5 of 6non-governmental organization is the Integrated Sus-
tainable Waste Management (ISWM). This waste man-
agement plan would optimally include a cohesive tie in
the environmental sustainability, economic costs and so-
cial acceptance of all potential solutions for the current
waste crisis in Beirut [15, 16]. Another multifaceted meas-
ure would be the initiation of a national committee in
Lebanon for the monitoring and surveillance of proper
disposal and garbage treatment practices. The government
can also participate by appointing local municipalities with
waste management responsibilities, and provide these
municipalities with technical and financial support [3].
Lebanon recently finalized the municipalities that poten-
tially need to systematically address this waste manage-
ment problem in an evidence-based manner. However,
our results are timely and critical for these new leaders to
urgently take on a more active role. Despite the fact that
there might not be an optimal solution for waste disposal,
efforts should be directed towards involving all stake-
holders in formulating local models and building on the
strengths of the city [17].
Conclusion
It has been established that improper waste management
can have an impact on the physical health in the short
run. However, if this waste crisis is not contained and
managed immediately, it might have other long-term
health implications. Therefore, it is important to take
necessary measures and implement policies to maintain
the situation, to avoid emergence of epidemics and attend
to these health consequences before they occur.

"The open burning of plastic wastes is a practice that is highly prevalent across the globe, toxic to human and 
environmental health, and a critical—but often overlooked—aspect of plastic pollution. Most of the countries 
where such burning is widespread have laws and policies in place against it; open burning continues never­
theless. In this article, using data from ethnographic fieldwork in urban and rural sites in India, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Zambia, we examine local practices of open burning and investigate why regulations to tackle it 
have proven largely ineffective. Adopting a harm reduction approach, we then suggest preliminary measures to 
mitigate the health risks of open burning by targeting those plastics and packaging types that are most toxic 
when burned.

BACKGROUND: Prescribed agricultural burning is a common land management practice, but little is known about the health
effects from the resulting smoke exposure.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between smoke from prescribed burning and cardiorespiratory outcomes in the U.S. state
of Kansas.
METHODS: We analyzed a zip code-level, daily time series of primary cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits for
February–May (months when prescribed burning is common in Kansas) in the years 2009–2011 (n = 109,220). Given limited
monitoring data, we formulated a measure of smoke exposure using non-traditional datasets, including ﬁre radiative power and
locational attributes from remote sensing data sources. We then assigned a population-weighted potential smoke impact factor
(PSIF) to each zip code, based on ﬁre intensity, smoke transport, and ﬁre proximity. We used Poisson generalized linear models to
estimate the association between PSIF on the same day and in the past 3 days and asthma, respiratory including asthma, and
cardiovascular ED visits.
RESULTS: During the study period, prescribed burning took place on approximately 8 million acres in Kansas. Same-day PSIF was
associated with a 7% increase in the rate of asthma ED visits when adjusting for month, year, zip code, meteorology, day of week,
holidays, and correlation within zip codes (rate ratio [RR]: 1.07; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.13). Same-day PSIF was not
associated with a combined outcome of respiratory ED visits (RR [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.97, 1.02]), or cardiovascular ED visits (RR [95% CI]:
1.01 [0.98, 1.04]). There was no consistent association between PSIF during the past 3 days and any of the outcomes.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest an association between smoke exposure and asthma ED visits on the same day. Elucidating
these associations will help guide public health programs that address population-level exposure to smoke from prescribed
burning.

INTRODUCTION
Wildland ﬁre smoke is associated with irritation of the respiratory
system, exacerbations of chronic diseases such as asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and premature mortality
[1, 2]. Exposure to smoke is particularly hazardous for individuals
with preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease [3].
Large-scale prescribed agricultural burning, a contributor to
wildland ﬁre smoke emissions, is a common land management
practice. Prescribed burning of invasive vegetation and old growth
returns nutrients back to the soil and can be beneﬁcial to the
surviving plants and landscapes [4]. It is used to reduce fuel
loading in forested and agricultural areas and hence potentially
prevent wildﬁres, and also used to enhance native vegetation, and
maintain ecosystems [4, 5]. The smoke from prescribed burning
contains numerous air pollutants including particulate matter,
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic com-
pounds [5]. The known health effects of inhalation of air pollution
include detrimental effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems [6].
Although the impact of prescribed burning on air quality is well
described [7–11], research on its impact on health is limited [7, 12].
Results from the few studies on the health effects of prescribed
burning suggest adverse health impacts from this practice. One
study conducted in the southeastern United States estimated a
modest increase in emergency department (ED) visits for asthma
due to exposure to smoke from prescribed burning [13]. A second

1234567890();,:study conducted in this region used information from burn permits
and concentration-response functions to estimate that prescribed
burning is associated with asthma ED visits, hospital admission for
respiratory reasons, and premature death [14]. In a different region
of the United States, a study in the Paciﬁc Northwest used a health
impact assessment tool and observed associations between
prescribed burning and an increase in respiratory symptoms,
bronchitis, lost days of work, and death [15].
The Flint Hills region of Kansas and northern Oklahoma is a
tallgrass prairie where approximately 2 million acres are cleared by
prescribed agricultural burning each spring [16]. Burning in this
region promotes the growth of desired grass species and controls
woody species growth ultimately resulting in increased cattle
weight gain [17, 18]. These burns are a substantial contributor to
air pollution [19, 20]. Levels of air pollution that exceed the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards have been recorded in
Kansas and nearby states following prescribed burning activities
[18]. In 2017, it was estimated that prescribed burning was
responsible for 44% of primary ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5)
emissions in Kansas, compared with only 14% nationally [21].
Despite elevated air pollution levels, the health effects of smoke
exposure resulting from prescribed burning in Kansas is currently
unknown. This
study
sought
to determine
the
impact
of
prescribed agricultural burning on cardiorespiratory ED visits in
Kansas.
MATERIALS/SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We conducted a time series study in the state of Kansas using a
measure of smoke exposure formulated from non-traditional
datasets and daily zip-code level cardiorespiratory ED visits from
2009 to 2011.
Limited air quality monitoring data were available for the region
and time period of interest. Additionally, we found no accessible
information on the dates and locations of prescribed burns. In the
absence of this information, we used remote-sensing data and
model-based predictions to calculate a “potential smoke impact
factor” (PSIF; described below) and used the PSIF to characterize
population-level exposure to smoke from agricultural burning. We
downloaded burn-related information from the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Fire Information for
Resource Management System [22]. Speciﬁcally, we obtained
information from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, which identify
ﬁre pixels that have had one or more ﬁres. From these 1×1
kilometer (km) pixels, we extracted information on maximum ﬁre
radiative power (FRP) for each day in our spatial and temporal
domains. Typically, FRP is used to ascertain emission rates and
factors [23–26], but for this assessment we used it to approximate
ﬁre intensity.
Initially, we considered using a distance-weighted measure of
FRP for each block group without considering other meteorologic
factors. However, as highlighted by Waller and colleagues [27],
distance-weighting alone will not capture the true “exposure
potential” as air pollutant impacts may depend not just on
distance to emission sources but also on other factors such as
wind characteristics. Hence, population-exposure resulting from
ﬁres with differing ﬁre intensities was estimated factoring in both
smoke dispersion and proximity to each ﬁre location. Smoke
dispersion from the location of each individual ﬁre was assumed
to be heavily inﬂuenced by wind speed and direction as
agricultural burning happens over grasslands with no signiﬁcant
elevation differences.
We combined information on ﬁre intensity with estimates of
surface meteorological parameters generated from the North
American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS) model
[28]. First, we created eight wind sector designations of 45° each
based on a continuous measure of wind direction (i.e., 22.5°–67.4°,
67.5°–112.4°,
112.5°–157.4°,
157.5°–202.4°,
202.5°–247.4°,
247.5°–292.4°, 292.5°–337.4°, 337.5°–22.4°). Using hourly wind
characteristics, we calculated daily wind probability and speed
for each of the eight wind-sector designations, for each ﬁre pixel
and separately for each U.S. Census block group. We also created a
distance matrix, providing the distance between each ﬁre pixel
and block group in Kansas. We limited the radius of inﬂuence for
each ﬁre to block groups within 100 km. After using wind direction
and location to identify block groups that potentially could receive
smoke from a ﬁre due to congruent wind direction, we used the
inverse of the squared distances between centroids of each block
group and ﬁre pixel as weights to calculate a daily smoke
exposure metric for each block group. Of note, using a distance-
weighted approach is common in environmental health, especially
to assign pollution impacts from a speciﬁc source [27, 29, 30]. We
then generated population-weighted estimates of this potential
smoke impact factor (PSIF) at the zip code level from block group
level estimates to align with the geographic resolution of the
available health data.
We evaluated the PSIF metric using the limited available air
quality monitoring data. During the period of this analysis, air
quality data were available on PM2.5 and ozone from 4 air quality
monitors, coarse particulate matter (PM10) from 2 air quality
monitors, and carbon monoxide from 1 air quality monitor. PM2.5
was sampled every 3 to 6 days; all other pollutants were sampled
daily. The monitors were located in the cities of Wichita, Peck,
Topeka, and Olathe; all in Eastern Kansas. We matched PSIF data
with air monitoring data by zip code and estimated Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient (r).
We analyzed a zip code-level, daily time series of primary
cardiorespiratory ED visits for the years 2009–2011. We examined
three outcomes: (1) asthma ED visits (2) respiratory ED visits
including asthma, wheeze, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections, and (3)
cardiovascular ED visits including ischemic heart disease, dys-
rhythmia, congestive heart failure, and ischemic stroke (Interna-
tional

Modiﬁcation [ICD-9-CM] codes listed in Table 1). Daily counts of
ED visits for each outcome were calculated for each zip code in
Kansas from individual-level data. We used zip code of patient
residence for aggregating ED visits; ED visits were excluded if the
patient resided outside the state of Kansas. ED data were obtained

Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (2023) 33:663 – 669from the Kansas Hospital Association (KHA) and the Veterans
Health Administration. On average, ED data were available from
100 KHA hospitals each year, representing approximately 73% of
KHA member hospitals in Kansas during this period. Data were
obtained from all Veterans Affairs hospitals in Kansas.
We used Poisson generalized linear models that accounted for
overdispersion to estimate the association between PSIF (same-
day [lag 0] and 3-day moving average [lag 0–2], i.e., same day and
two previous days) and asthma, respiratory, and cardiovascular ED
visits. Analyses were restricted to the months when prescribed
burning is common in Kansas (February–May) and to zip codes
with at least one primary asthma ED visit and one primary
cardiovascular ED visit during the analysis months. The distribu-
tion of PSIF was highly skewed towards 0 and was modeled in two
ways: (1) a binary variable (presence vs. absence of smoke
exposure) and (2) a 4-level variable (zero vs. tertiles of non-zero
exposure). All models were implemented using generalized
estimating equations with a ﬁrst-order autoregressive correlation
structure to allow for correlation within zip code. Covariate control
for temporal and meteorologic factors was based on a previously
developed model for estimating the association between air
pollution and cardiorespiratory outcomes [31]. Adjusted models
controlled for parametric cubic splines with monthly knots, year,
zip code, day of week, holidays, cubic polynomials for lag 0
maximum temperature, cubic polynomials for lag 0 mean dew
point, and cubic polynomials for lag 1–2 moving average
minimum temperature (for models assessing 3-day moving
average PSIF exposure).
For models with results indicating a health effect of prescribed
burning, we also considered a negative control exposure (NCE) to
evaluate residual confounding, model miss-speciﬁcation and
measurement error. In these analyses, we added PSIF 2 days in
the future to the model and assessed its association with the
outcome of interest. This negative control approach uses the fact
that a future exposure cannot cause past health outcomes to
assess potential biases [32–34]. We used PSIF 2 days in the future
(rather than the typical 1 day used in this approach) because there
is a morning satellite pass that may identify ﬁres that started late
on the previous day and were hence not captured in the previous
day’s exposure estimate.
All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) and R 4.02 [35]. This activity was reviewed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was conducted
consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (See e.g.,
45C.F.R. part 46, 21C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. §241(d); 5 U.S.C. §552a;
44 U.S.C. §3501 et seq.).
RESULTS
During the study years (2009–2011), prescribed burning took
place on approximately 8 million acres in Kansas [36]. PSIF levels
were highest in April, the month when prescribed burning was
most frequent (Table 2, Fig. 1). Levels were highest in the Eastern
part of the state where the Flint Hills region is located (Fig. 1).
Comparing the PSIF to the limited available air quality monitoring
data, there was moderate overall correlation between PSIF and
PM2.5 (r = 0.33) with correlation at individual air monitors ranging
from a minimum of r = 0.16 to a maximum of r = 0.49. Poor
correlation was observed between PSIF and other air pollutants,
such as, ozone, PM10, and carbon monoxide.
Between February–May, 2009–2011, 9,824 primary asthma ED
visits, 69,620 primary respiratory ED visits, and 39,600 primary
cardiovascular ED visits were identiﬁed in the health dataset
(Table 1). Of these ED visits, 98% were to KHA hospitals with the
remaining 2% to Veterans Affairs hospitals. The average patient
age was 41 years old; 34.7% of ED visits were to individuals under
the age of 18 (Table 3). Approximately half of visits were to
patients of female sex (49.2%). The majority of visits were to
patients of White or Black race (72.3% and 10.7% respectively) and
non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (81.0%). Counts of asthma ED
visits peaked in the spring and fall months (Fig. 2).
Having a non-zero PSIF level was associated with a 7% increase
in the rate of asthma ED visits on the same day in both unadjusted
and adjusted models (rate ratio [95% conﬁdence interval (CI)]: 1.07

comparing tertiles of exposure to a reference group of non-
exposure, adjusted rates of asthma ED visits on the same day were
3% higher in the ﬁrst tertile, 10% higher in the second tertile, and
7% higher in the third tertile (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.03 [0.93, 1.15],
1.10 [1.01, 1.19], 1.07 [0.99, 1.15] respectively) than rates in the
reference group of no exposure (PSIF = 0). Having a non-zero
three-day moving average PSIF level was associated with a 2%
increase in the rate of asthma ED visits when adjusting for
covariates (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.97, 1.08]) (Table 4). When
comparing tertiles of 3-day moving average exposure to a
reference group of non-exposure, the pattern was not monotonic;
adjusted rates of asthma ED visits were 4% higher in the ﬁrst
tertile, 2% lower in the second tertile, and 6% higher in the third
tertile (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.04 [0.96, 1.12], 0.98 [0.92, 1.05], 1.06
[0.99, 1.04], respectively) than rates in the reference group of no
exposure.
For the analysis between PSIF modeled as a binary variable and
asthma, we evaluated the association of a NCE with the outcome,
adding PSIF 2 days in the future to the model. We found no
meaningful association between the future variable and asthma
(results not shown) and inclusion of the future variable did not
change the association between same-day PSIF and asthma. For
this model to converge, we omitted zip code control for which
had little impact in the main analyses.
When examining respiratory ED visits including asthma (Table 1),
we found no evidence of an association with PSIF level. The
adjusted rate ratios for both same-day PSIF level and 3-day
moving average PSIF level were close to the null value of 1 (rate
ratio [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.97, 1.02], 0.99 [0.97, 1.01], respectively) as
were most of the rate ratios when comparing tertiles of exposure
to a reference group of no exposure (Table 4).
For cardiovascular ED visits, we found no consistent evidence of
an association with PSIF level. Having a non-zero PSIF level was
associated with a 1% increase in the adjusted rate of ED visits on
the same day (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.01 [0.98, 1.04]), and having a
non-zero 3-day moving average PSIF level was associated with a
3% decrease in the adjusted rate of ED visits (rate ratio [95% CI]:
0.97 [0.94, 0.99]). When comparing tertiles of exposure to a
reference group of no exposure, results were mixed, with some
results suggesting an increased rate of ED visits with increasing
level of PSIF and other results suggesting a decreased rate of ED
visits with increasing level of PSIF (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest an association between smoke exposure
during the months when prescribed burning is common (i.e.,
February–May) and asthma ED visits on the same day. Although
negative controls are less than 100% sensitive for detection of bias
due to confounding or model misspeciﬁcation, the results of our
NCE analyses showed no indication of major modeling or
confounding issues impacting this result. We found no consistent
evidence of an association between smoke exposure and all
respiratory ED visits or cardiovascular ED visits. This study adds to

Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (2023) 33:663 – 669the limited previous research suggesting adverse health impacts
of smoke exposure resulting from prescribed burning.
Public health ofﬁcials and land managers can take steps to limit
exposure to smoke from prescribed burning. During seasons of
prescribed burning activities, health departments can educate
residents about protecting themselves from smoke exposure
using some of the same actions recommended during episodes of
wildﬁre smoke, including monitoring local air quality and keeping
indoor air clean [3]. These precautions are particularly important
for individuals at the highest risk for health impacts from smoke
such as those with preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular
disease. For land managers, the Kansas Flint Hills Smoke
Management Plan details ﬁre management practices that can be
used to help limit smoke from prescribed burns [18]. These
practices include using environmental and air quality conditions
to inform when to burn and reducing fuel loads prior to burning.
In the Flint Hills Region of Kansas, expanding the timing of
prescribed burning to help diminish resulting smoke concentra-
tions may also be an option [37, 38].
This study expands the scope of literature on the health
effects of prescribed burning by being conducted in the state of
Kansas and by using a different approach to estimating
exposure to smoke from prescribed burning. Combining multi-
ple environmental datasets to create the PSIF metric allowed us
to estimate zip-code level exposure to smoke from prescribed
burning
in
the
absence
of
robust
monitoring
data.
The
combination
of
remote
sensing
data
with
surface
wind
characteristics allowed us to identify communities that are
impacted by smoke from these ﬁres. Because burning in Kansas
occurs on a large-scale and in grasslands with a ﬂat terrain,
remote sensing data is expected to perform well at capturing
prescribed burns in Kansas. However, our PSIF metric will not
capture smoke exposure resulting from secondary formation
and may misclassify exposure resulting from long-range trans-
port of smoke and air pollution from sources that are outside of
Kansas. Improving record keeping on the location and timing of
prescribed burns along with increasing air quality monitoring in
areas with prescribed burning could help reduce any potential
exposure misclassiﬁcation in future studies addressing the
health impact of burning activities.
We should consider several potential limitations in addition to
creating exposure measures from non-traditional data sources.
Although exposure to and the impacts of smoke from prescribed
burning may be larger in certain demographic groups, we did
not examine potential differential effects by race, ethnicity, or
socioeconomic factors. By examining combined outcomes of
respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, we may have masked
true associations with individual respiratory or cardiovascular
conditions. Using zip code as the spatial unit of analysis has
limitations because zip codes do not align directly with the
spatial unit of data collection for health or environmental
factors. We observed low correlations between the PSIF metric
and air quality monitoring data; the limited availability of
monitoring data prevented us from determining how represen-
tative these results may be for the full study region. We
estimated ambient smoke exposure which may differ from
personal smoke exposure due to behavior modiﬁcations such as
avoiding going outside on days with poor air quality or using
indoor air ﬁltration systems. Although we adjusted for a wide
range of potential confounders, given the large number of
factors that can impact cardiorespiratory exacerbations it is
possible that uncontrolled confounding may have impacted
ﬁndings. Examples of potential confounders that were not
accounted for include additional meteorological factors, area-
level socioeconomic status, and land use factors. A previous
study in the state of Georgia observed higher levels of social

Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology (2023) 33:663 – 669vulnerability in areas impacted by prescribed burning [14]. If the
same association exists in Kansas, social vulnerability could
potentially confound the results of this study given the known
disparities in cardiorespiratory outcomes by components of
social vulnerability such as socioeconomic status and race
[39, 40].
The data for this study are for the years 2009 to 2011.
Nevertheless, prescribed burning is still a common practice in
Kansas. During the years of this study, an average of approxi-
mately 2.7 million acres were burned in prescribed ﬁres each year
in the Flint Hills region of Kansas. Comparatively, between 2019
and 2021, in the same region, an average of approximately 2.4
million acres were burned annually [36]. Given the similarities in
acreage burned, we anticipate that our results are relevant to the
health impacts of prescribed burning in Kansas today.
Prescribed burning is a common agricultural practice in Kansas and
in many other geographic locations. In this study using ED data from
across Kansas and a novel metric of smoke exposure, we observed an
association between smoke during the months in which prescribed
burning is common in Kansas and asthma ED visits. Continuing to
elucidate the impact of smoke from prescribed burning on health will
help guide public health programs that address population-level
smoke exposure. Educating the public on protecting themselves from
the smoke of prescribed burning and ensuring that land managers
take steps to limit smoke production from these burns may be
important steps to help limit health impacts.

Research
On 1 June 2008, a lightning strike initiated 
a fire in the eastern plains of North Carolina. 
Low humidity and prolonged drought con­
tributed to the spread of the fire into the 
Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, 
where it smoldered through rich deposits of 
peat. Peat in the refuge was, on average, 3 ft 
and in places up to 15 ft deep. Poor oxygen 
supply during combustion of carbon in the 
decomposing vegetation produced massive 
amounts of smoke. The region exposed to the 
hazardous levels of air pollution generated by 
the fire was largely rural, sparsely populated, 
and economically disadvantaged.
To investigate health effects associated 
with this fire, we obtained data on daily 
emergency department (ED) visits for car­
diac and respiratory conditions for eastern 
North Carolina counties reported through 
the statewide syndromic surveillance system. 
Satellite measurements of aerosol optical 
depth (AOD) were used to determine a 3‑day 
window of dense plume. We estimated rela­
tive risks (RRs) associated with these days and 
5‑lag days for the counties most impacted by 
the smoke plume and the surrounding, less 
impacted, referent counties.
Air pollution is a complex mixture of 
gases and particles whose toxicity depends 
on the type of fuel and conditions of com­
bustion. There are > 100 epidemiological 
studies demonstrating mortality and morbid­
ity associated with both chronic and acute 
exposures to air pollution, mostly focused 
on emissions of burning fossil fuels in auto­
mobiles, diesel engines, and coal- or oil-fired 
power plants [U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) 2009b]. During episodes of 
wildfires, affected regions experience acute 
exposures, with concentrations that are orders 
of magnitude larger than observed in urban 
centers. However, health implications of the 
exposure to wildfire emissions are less well 
understood (Naeher et al. 2007). In contrast 
to health studies of urban air pollution, wild­
fire studies are constrained by the size and 
distribution of the exposed population, 
duration of the episode, and the retrospec­
tive accessibility of data on exposure and 
health outcomes. The most comprehensive 
studies, conducted for forest fires near large 
metropoli­tan areas, have reported significant 
increases in symptoms and exacerba­tions 
of under­lying respiratory illnesses (Delfino 
et al. 2009; Duclos et al. 1990; Johnson et al. 
2005; Künzli et al. 2006). Less-conclusive 
results have been found within smaller cohort 
and convenience sample–based studies and 
less-populated regions (Moore et al. 2006; 
Mott et al. 2005). The effects of exposure on 
cardio­vascular outcomes have been reported 
with more varied results (Delfino et al. 2009; 
Moore et al. 2006; Mott et al. 2005; Sastry 
2002; Vedal and Dutton 2006), in part due 
to lack of statisti­cal power.

Background: In June 2008, burning peat deposits produced haze and air pollution far in excess 
of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, encroaching on rural communities of eastern North 
Carolina. Although the association of mortality and morbidity with exposure to urban air pollu­
tion is well established, the health effects associated with exposure to wildfire emissions are less well 
understood.
Objective: We investigated the effects of exposure on cardio­respiratory outcomes in the population 
affected by the fire.
Methods: We performed a population-based study using emergency department (ED) visits 
reported through the syndromic surveillance program NC DETECT (North Carolina Disease Event 
Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool). We used aerosol optical depth meas­ured by a satellite 
to determine a high-exposure window and distinguish counties most impacted by the dense smoke 
plume from surrounding referent counties. Poisson log-linear regression with a 5‑day distributed lag 
was used to estimate changes in the cumulative relative risk (RR).
Results: In the exposed counties, significant increases in cumulative RR for asthma [1.65 (95% 
confidence interval, 1.25–2.1)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1.73 (1.06–2.83)], and 
pneumonia and acute bronchitis [1.59 (1.07–2.34)] were observed. ED visits associated with cardio­
pulmonary symptoms [1.23 (1.06–1.43)] and heart failure [1.37 (1.01–1.85)] were also significantly 
increased.
Conclusions: Satellite data and syndromic surveillance were combined to assess the health impacts 
of wildfire smoke in rural counties with sparse air-quality monitoring. This is the first study to 
demon­strate both respiratory and cardiac effects after brief exposure to peat wildfire smoke.

Climate-related changes and past land-
use practices are expected to increase the risk 
of wildfires in upcoming decades (National 
Interagency Fire Center 2009). In addition to 
the forests, of particular concern is the vulnera­
bility of large deposits of peat bogs to wildfires. 
Peat soil accounts for approximately 2% of 
global land cover, mostly in the boreal regions, 
where it has been traditionally harvested for 
energy. In drought conditions, peat bogs are 
exceptionally susceptible to ignition, can smol­
der indefinitely, and are notoriously difficult to 
extinguish. Although less common than for­
est fires, they have an important impact on 
regional climate and ecosystems. In 1997, 
Indonesian peat fires released the equivalent 
of 13–40% of the mean annual global car­
bon emissions from fossil fuels and contributed 
to the largest annual increase in atmospheric 
carbon dioxide (CO2) in four decades (Page 
et al. 2002). Despite the large impact of peat 
fires on the environment, significantly less is 
known about the associated health effects. 
One study of the Indonesian fires reported 
> 500 haze-related deaths, 290,000 cases of 
asthma exacerbation, 58,000 cases of bronchi­
tis, and 1,440,000 cases of acute respiratory 
infection between September and November 
1997 (Kunii et al. 2002).
Methods
We obtained daily counts of ED visits 
from the North Carolina Disease Event 
Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool 
(NC DETECT 2010), a statewide, early-event 
detection and public health surveillance sys­
tem that records daily ED visits from 111 of 
114 civilian North Carolina EDs. We con­
sidered visits for selected cardio­vascular and 
respiratory outcomes by adults throughout the 
eastern portion of the state, as well as county 
of residence, sex, age, date of admission, and 
discharge ICD‑9‑CM [International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(U.S. Public Health Service and Health Care 
Financing Administration 1980)] codes for all 
visits. Prior to the analysis, outcomes of inter­
est were defined through ICD‑9‑CM codes 
for asthma (493), chronic obstructive pulmo­
nary disease (COPD) (491–492), pneumo­
nia and acute bronchitis (481, 482, 485, 486, 
and 466), upper respiratory tract infections 
(URIs) (465), heart failure (428), cardiac dys­
rhythmia (427), and myo­cardial infarction 
(410, 411.1). ICD‑9‑CM codes grouped into 
all respiratory and all cardiac outcomes are 
listed in Table 1. Cardio­pulmonary symptoms 
(ICD‑9‑CM code 786) were grouped sepa­
rately. For respiratory-related outcomes, the 
population was stratified into two age groups: 
19–64 years and ≥ 65 years. The small num­
bers of ED visits for respiratory-related events 
in those < 19 years of age precluded analy­
sis of this subgroup. Cardiac outcomes were 
also stratified into two age groups: 45–64 years 
and ≥ 65 years. There were not enough visits 
for cardio­vascular events for people < 45 years 
of age to be informative. The population was 
dichotomized to differentiate causes of cardio­
vascular outcomes associated with ischemic 
heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction, 
which are less prevalent in the younger popula­
tion. The human subjects institutional review 
boards of the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill, East Carolina University, and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
approved the study. 
The study period was defined as the time 
between the onset of the wildfire through 
mid‑July when controlled flooding, increased 
humidity, and the first rainfall largely con­
tained the fire (1 June–14 July 2008). During 
this period, average daily temperatures ranged 
from 69 to 86oF, with overnight lows always 
< 75oF [see Supplemental Material, Figure 1 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003206)]. 
For most of the period, winds blew from the 
west, and smoke affected only a few sparsely 
populated neighboring counties. However, 
on 10 June, easterly winds directed the smoke 
plume inland, exposing a large portion of 
eastern and central North Carolina for a 
3‑day period (Figure 1A–C). On 12 June, the 
maximum 1‑hr concentration of fine particu­
late matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) 
exceeded 200 μg/m3 at ground-based moni­
tors located 200 km from the fire. We defined 
10–12 June as a window of high exposure, 
and estimated risks associated with the expo­
sure days and a 1‑ to 5‑day lag period after 
each exposure day relative to the non­exposed 
days of the 6‑week study period. Figure 2 
illustrates the window of exposure and lagged 
days of exposure along with the daily asthma 
visits. The RRs for lag days 0–5 were summa­
rized to define cumulative risk of exposure. 
County-level exposure to the plume was 
classified using AOD, measured by instru­
ments aboard a geo­stationary operational 
environ­mental satellite. AOD is a unit­less 
measure with scale from 0 to 2 of the atmo­
spheric scattering and absorption of light by 
aerosols, where larger values indicate higher 
concentration of particles in the atmosphere 
and lower visibility. Half-hour, 4 × 4 km 
resolution grid maps of AOD were aver­
aged over the available daytime hours. AOD 
has been shown to be a good surrogate for 
boundary layer fine particulate matter con­
centrations and a predictor of the Air Quality 
Index, a nationally uniform index for report­
ing daily air quality (Al-Saadi et al. 2005; 
Engel-Cox et al. 2004; U.S. EPA 2009a; 
Wang and Christopher 2003). Typical back­
ground levels of AOD for this region were 
well below 0.5. Based on the sharp difference 
between the high-density plume and back­
ground, we chose an AOD of ≥ 1.25 as an 
indicator of the high-density plume. Counties

with a minimum of 25% of the geographic 
area exceeding this threshold were defined as 
exposed to the smoke plume for each day in 
the high-exposure window. The operational 
algorithm of the satellite considers high AOD 
values created by strong reflectance from 
clouds as unreliable and removes them from 
the standard data product. At times, the dense 
smoke plume was classified as a cloud, result­
ing in missing AOD values on the interior 
of the plume. We considered such values as 
right-censored and classified the respective 
grid cells as exposed to the plume.
The study population resided in 42 contig­
uous counties in eastern North Carolina. One 
sparsely populated county (Gates County) was 
significantly impacted by another wildfire and 
was excluded from this analysis. Counties with 
smoke exposure on at least 2 days were con­
sidered exposed (18 counties in Figure 1D). 
The 23 referent counties were exposed 1 day 
(15 counties) or < 1 day (8 counties). The 
populations of exposed and referent counties 
are similar with respect to age structure, 
ethnicity, population density, and socio­
economic status. Counties in eastern North 
Carolina are more rural and agricultural, with 
a higher percentage of African Americans, 
and of lower socio­economic status than most 
of the remaining North Carolina counties.

Material, Table 1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/
ehp.1003206).
We applied a Poisson regression model to 
daily counts of ED visits for combined and 
individual cardio­vascular and respiratory out­
comes separately, with explanatory variables 
indicating days within the 3‑day window of 
dense smoke and subsequent 5 days of lagged 
exposure. The RR associated with days in 
which a county was exposed to wildfire smoke 
(and corresponding 5 lag days) was compared 
with other days in which that county was not 
exposed to smoke. For non­exposed (refer­
ent) counties, RR was calculated using the 
same days as were used for the exposed coun­
ties. RR was estimated separately for exposed 
and referent counties. The effects of exposure 
on outcomes at lags was estimated using an 
unconstrained distributed lag model (Peng and 
Dominici 2008). Previous studies (Braga et al. 
2001; Pope et al. 2008) have determined that 
air pollution produces immediate and delayed 
effects on morbidity and mortality and that 
the time to adverse outcome may vary by pol­
lutant and health outcomes. From the perspec­
tive of public health, in the present study we 
were interested in the total burden on human 
health associated with the wildfire episode. 
Inference on delay between the exposure and 
effect is not appropriate for this study without 
personal exposure measurements. Here, the 
results are reported in terms of the cumula­
tive relative risk (cRR), that is, cumulative risk 
over lag days 0–5 after exposure (Peng and 
Dominici 2008) according to

where βi is the log RR estimate associated with

100% and as cRR in Supplemental Material, 
Tables  2–4 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/
ehp.1003206). The analysis was stratified 
by age and sex in both exposed and referent 
county cohorts.
Results
Asthma-related visits accounted for 44% of all 
respiratory codes considered, and heart fail­
ure accounted for 33% of all cardiac events. 
Consistent with the distribution of asthma 
prevalence by sex, the aggregate counts of 
asthma-related visits occurred in more women 
(70%) than men and in more individuals 
between 19 and 64 years (85%) compared 
with those ≥ 65 years of age. Cardiac events 
were substantially more common in individu­
als ≥ 65 years (67%) compared with those 
45–64 years of age. The number of clinical 
events reported for each ICD‑9‑CM code 
during the study period is given in Table 1.
In the exposed counties, ED visits for 
several outcomes were significantly increased 
during the high-exposure days and subse­
quent lag days compared with visits during 
the remainder of the 6‑week study period in 
the exposed counties (Figure 3). ED visits 
for all the respiratory diagnoses were elevated 
in the exposed counties [cRR = 1.66; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.38–1.99] but not 
in the referent counties [1.06 (0.89–1.25)]. 
Among the respiratory outcomes, ED vis­
its for asthma [1.65 (1.25–2.17)], COPD 
[1.73 (1.06–2.83)], and pneumonia and acute 
bronchitis [1.59 (1.07–2.34)] increased sig­
nificantly. Visits for URIs [1.68 (0.94–3.00)] 
also increased but were not statistically signifi­
cant. We found no significant differences in 
respiratory outcomes when cumulative risks 
over the same calendar days were estimated 
for the referent counties.
In the exposed counties, cRR for heart fail­
ure–related ED visits [cRR = 1.37 (95% CI, 
1.01–1.85)] during the 3 high-exposure days 
and 5 subsequent lag days was increased com­
pared with other days, whereas visits for myo­
cardial infarction and cardiac dysrhythmias 
were not increased for the same time periods 
in exposed or referent counties. Reflecting 
the increase in cardiac and respiratory events, 
ED visits associated with cardio­pulmonary 
symptoms (ICD‑9‑CM code 786) were sig­
nificantly increased [1.23 (1.06–1.43)] in the 
exposed counties.
Associations with respiratory outcomes 
varied by age and sex, and stratified analy­
ses reflected higher uncertainty because of 
lower counts of events in these subgroups. In 
exposed counties, visits for asthma, pneumo­
nia, acute bronchitis, and URI increased to 
a greater extent among women than among 
men (Figure 4A). In contrast, visits related to 
COPD were elevated only in men in exposed 
counties. There was a greater increase in ED 
visits for asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and 
acute bronchitis during exposed versus unex­
posed days among individuals < 65 years of age 
compared with those ≥ 65 years in the exposed 
counties (Figure 4B). We observed no differ­
ences in ED visits for cardio­vascular events 
stratified by age or sex, possibly because the 
smaller number of visits for these ICD‑9‑CM 
codes diminished the power to observe effects 
in these subgroups.
Discussion
This is the first population-based health study 
of peat bog fire exposures using a syndromic 
surveillance system with a nearly comprehen­
sive record of health outcomes from an entire 
geographic region. We estimated the cRR of 
ED visits for cardio­respiratory outcomes asso­
ciated with 3 high-exposure days and their 
corresponding 5 lag days. The study demon­
strates that exposure to smoke from the wild­
fire increased ED visits for asthma, COPD, 
pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and heart failure 
in a sparsely popu­lated non­urban area. The 
study also demon­strates the utility of syndro­
mic surveillance in assessment of health bur­
den during widespread environ­mental events. 
In turn, such assessments should help guide 
develop­ment of strategies and the allocation of 
resources for the public health response.
Consistent with the results from other 
studies, asthma-related outcomes were most 
prevalent, especially among adult women. A 
surprising and important observation is the 
statistically significant association between 
smoke exposure and an increase in ED visits 
for heart failure, as well as the trend toward a 
positive association with acute coronary syn­
drome (myo­cardial infarction and unstable 
angina). We restricted the cardio­vascular clini­
cal end points to acute coronary syndrome, 
which included myocardial infarction and 
unstable angina (ICD-9 410 and 411.1) and 
heart failure (ICD-9 428) and excluded hyper­
tensive heart disease. Although previous stud­
ies have shown positive associations between 
ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and ED vis­
its and hospitalization for heart failure (Brook 
et al. 2010; Dominici et al. 2007; Wellenius 
et al. 2005, 2006), to our knowledge this is 
the first study that has reported ED visits for 
heart failure associated with wildfire exposure.

that an increased risk of cardio­vascular mor­
tality and morbidity may be due, in part, to 
wood smoke emissions (Sanhueza et al. 2009; 
Schwartz et al. 1993). Our study demon­
strated an increased percent change in RR of 
37%. Compared with the rest of the state, 
counties of eastern North Carolina are among 
the poorest and least healthy counties, charac­
terized by higher prevalence of hypertension, 
diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and heart fail­
ure (North Carolina State Center for Health 
Statistics 2009). These are clinical conditions 
that are associated with individuals more vul­
nerable to the health effects of ambient air 
particle pollution and may have contributed 
to the large number of events in this relatively 
sparse population (O’Neill et al. 2005, 2007; 
Wellenius et al. 2005).
Unlike the hot canopy forest fires often 
seen in the western portion of the country, 
the Pocosin fire was not associated with high 
temperatures and heat waves. Instead, a pro­
longed drought led to the unusually dry con­
ditions in the region that allowed for rapid 
spread of fire across the peat bogs after a light­
ning strike. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
we did not observe long-term linear trends or 
seasonality for the principal respiratory and 
cardiac diagnoses during this study period 
as shown for visits for asthma (Figure 2). 
However, at least three types of mis­classifi­
cation in exposure could have occurred in the 
study. First, any days with elevated AOD lev­
els outside the 3‑day window were classified 
as unexposed days, which could have resulted 
in a bias toward the null hypothesis. Second, 
some of the referent counties were exposed 
to emissions from the fire at some point dur­
ing the 6‑week period, although not to the 
extent of the exposed counties, also poten­
tially resulting in bias toward the null hypoth­
esis. Finally, some misclassifi­cation at the 
individual level may have occurred because 
of differences in exposure between county 
groups. According to information from the 
2000 census (U.S. Census Bureau 2010), 
exposed counties are demographically simi­
lar to but more rural than referent counties, 
which may have resulted in a higher exposure 
[see Supplemental Material, Table 1 (http://
dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003206)]. However, 
no individual data were available for the anal­
ysis. Well-documented risks of increased mor­
bidity and mortality due to air pollution have 
been based largely on central site monitoring 
and time-series studies of health outcomes 
within major urban centers. Rural and remote 
areas are often not studied because of sparse 
population and lack of monitoring data. The 
type and availability of monitoring most often 
found in sparsely populated areas, such as in 
this study, provide limited information about 
the geographic scope of exposure times of 
environ­mental events. Air pollution monitors 
collect data at irregular temporal resolution 
(e.g., every 24 hr, every 3 days, every 6 days) 
and do not provide comprehensive informa­
tion regarding the geographic scope of the 
exposure, depending on monitor location, 
wind direction, and terrain (e.g., differences 
in elevation). Developing new methods for 
assessing exposure will be increasingly more 
important as wildfires and other environ­
mental events become more frequent. Several 
computer models for atmospheric pollutant 
dispersion already exist but are difficult to 
vali­date against sparse ground measurements. 
In this study we used satellite-derived meas­
ure­ments of AOD to define spatial boundar­
ies of the smoke plume. This allowed us to 
capture the geographic extent of ED visits 
in the region and thereby increase statistical 
power. Such exposure assessment, however, 
allows us to associate changes in RR to the 
exposure period but not to the concentration 
of air pollutants.
Central reporting of ED visits and the 
high rate of case identification afforded by the 
NC DETECT syndromic surveillance sys­
tem contributed to the strength of the asso­
ciations we found in this study. Syndromic 
surveillance systems were developed to detect 
epi­demics and monitor outbreaks in near real-
time (Buehler et al. 2008). The program is 
implemented at the state level; the median rate 
of hospital participation in the United States is 
35% and ranges between 2 and 100%. Most 
states report chief complaint data alone, but 
a few, including North Carolina, report diag­
nostic ICD‑9‑CM codes. North Carolina has 
a uniquely comprehensive program, with 98% 
of its hospitals participating. Two other studies 
of health effects of wildfires in California and 
Florida (Johnson et al. 2005; Sorenset et al. 
1999) used syndromic surveillance data and 
reported increases in respiratory outcomes, 
asthma, respiratory complaints, eye irritation, 
and smoke inhalation for respiratory-related 
chief complaints. The strength of evidence 
found in the present study further supports 
efforts to expand automated surveillance sys­
tem for near-real-time delivery of informa­
tion and health advisories during emergencies. 
Although ICD‑9‑CM codes are not as timely 
as chief complaints, they can provide more 
specific measure­ments of health outcomes and 
should be added to syndromic surveillance 
systems in other states.
Peat fires burn significantly more biological 
mass, produce massive amounts of smoke, and 
are notoriously more difficult to extinguish 
than hot canopy forest fires or grassland fires 
(Muraleedharan et al. 2000; Page et al. 2002; 
See et al. 2007; Soja et al. 2004). One study of 
peat fire particle composition reported carbo­
naceous particles, particularly organic carbon,

excess risk (cRR = 19.16) [see Supplemental Material, Table 4 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003206)].

nitrate, and sulfate as major components of 
PM2.5, whereas the less-abundant constitu­
ents included ions such as ammonium, nitrite, 
sodium, potassium; organic acids; and metals 
such as aluminum, iron, and titanium (See 
et al. 2007). In another study, Muraleedharan 
et al. (2000) reported carbon monoxide, CO2, 
and methane to be the most abundant gas­
eous emissions. Although emissions from peat 
fires may differ from those from forest fires in 
chemical composition, it is not known if they 
differ in toxicity.
Population growth and land use alterations 
are the primary bases for increased wildfire 
events worldwide. Additional stress is created 
by earlier snow melts, rising temperatures, 
cumulative effects of the current drought, 
and other climate-related changes (National 
Interagency Fire Center 2009; Westerling et al. 
2006). Recent peat fires around Elektrogorsk, 
Russia, exemplify the synergistic effect 
of these factors and their impact on health 
and economy in the region (Reilly 2010). 
Unprecedented hot and dry weather in Russia 
during the summer of 2010 eased the spread 
of fires in swamps long ago drained to har­
vest energy from peat. The smoke obstructed 
ground and air travel and resulted in numer­
ous health advisories (Williams 2010). Peat 
bogs have been exploited for energy use in 
many parts of the world, leaving vest areas of 
dried wetlands and swamps particularly vul­
nerable to droughts. Therefore, the risk of peat 
fires is likely to increase in upcoming decades 
(National Interagency Fire Center 2009).
Conclusion
The consistent increase in RR in the exposed 
counties for nearly all outcome cate­gories dur­
ing and up to 5 days after exposure to wild­
fire smoke is striking and persuasive and has 
potentially significant public health implica­
tions. The precision of RR estimates in this 
study is attributed to the use of comprehen­
sive population health data from the North 
Carolina public surveillance program as well 
as to the use of spatially and temporally dense 
satellite measure­ments of AOD. The region 
of the state most affected by the smoke was 
sparsely populated, with few available air qual­
ity monitors. Therefore, traditional exposure 
assessment based on moni­toring and hospital 
admissions data alone would not provide us 
with enough information to assess the true 
risk. Both data sources used in this study are 
readily available to state and local public health 
officials and lend themselves to the applica­
tion of traditional statistical methods. In the 
near future, public health officials may benefit 
from dashboard-like visualization tools that 
allow end users to overlay environmental data 
with health care data to improve event charac­
terization capabilities and response efforts. 
Mitigation of exposure and raising public 
awareness would be expected to decrease the 
burden to the health care system and improve 
the well-being of the public.

"In Brazil, sugarcane ﬁelds are often burned to facilitate manual harvesting, and this burning causes
environmental pollution from the large amounts of soot released into the atmosphere. This material
contains numerous organic compounds such as PAHs. In this study, the concentrations of PAHs in two
particulate-matter fractions (PM2.5 and PM10) in the city of Araraquara (SE Brazil, with around 200,000
inhabitants and surrounded by sugarcane plantations) were determined during the sugarcane harvest
(HV) and non-harvest (NHV) seasons in 2008 and 2009. The sampling strategy included four campaigns,
with 60 samples in the NHV season and 220 samples in the HV season. The PM2.5 and PM10 fractions
were collected using a dichotomous sampler (10 L min1, 24 h) with Teﬂon ﬁlters. The ﬁlter sets were
extracted (ultrasonic bath with hexane/acetone (1:1 v/v)) and analyzed by HPLC/Fluorescence. The
median concentration for total PAHs (PM2.5 in 2009) was 0.99 ng m3 (NHV) and 3.3 ng m3 (HV). In the
HV season, the total concentration of carcinogenic PAHs (benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)ﬂuoranthene,
benzo(k)ﬂuoranthene, and benzo(a)pyrene) was 5 times higher than in the NHV season. B(a)P median
concentrations were 0.017 ng m3 and 0.12 ng m3 for the NHV and HV seasons, respectively. The
potential cancer risk associated with exposure through inhalation of these compounds was estimated
based on the benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalence (BaPeq), where the overall toxicity of a PAH mixture is
deﬁned by the concentration of each compound multiplied by its relative toxic equivalence factor (TEF).
BaPeq median (2008 and 2009 years) ranged between 0.65 and 1.0 ng m3 and 1.2e1.4 ng m3 for the
NHV and HV seasons, respectively. Considering that the maximum permissible BaPeq in ambient air is
1 ng m3, related to the increased carcinogenic risk, our data suggest that the level of human exposure to
PAHs in cities surrounded by sugarcane crops where the burning process is used is cause for concern.

Few studies have focused on the effects of exposure to air pollutants from vegetation ﬁre events (including forest
ﬁre and the burning of crop residues) among children. In this study we aimed to investigate the association be-
tween PM10 concentrations and hospital visits by children to address respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, and der-
matitis. We examined and compared these associations by the presence of vegetation ﬁre events on a given day
(burning, non-burning, and mixed) across the upper northern region of Thailand from 2014 through 2018. A veg-
etation burning was deﬁned when a ﬁre hotspot (obtained from NASA-MODIS) exceeded the 90th percentile of
the entire region and PM10 concentration was over 100 μg/m3. To determine the association between hospital
visits among children with PM10 concentrations on burning and non-burning days, we performed a time-
stratiﬁed case-crossover analysis ﬁtted with conditional logistic regression for each province. A random-effects
meta-analysis was applied to pool province-speciﬁc effect estimates. The number of burning days ranged from
64 to 139 days across eight provinces. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration on a burning day was associated
with a respiratory disease-related hospital visit at lag 0 (OR = 1.01 (95% CIs: 1.00, 1.02)). This association was not
observed for hospital visits related to conjunctivitis and dermatitis. A positive association was also observed be-
tween PM10 concentration on non-burning days and hospital visits related to respiratory disease at lag 0 (OR =
1.03 (95% CIs: 1.02, 1.04)). Hospital visits for conjunctivitis and dermatitis were signiﬁcantly associated with
PM10 concentration at lag 0 on both non-burning and mixed days.

"Intercellular communication between malignant cells and neighboring nonmalignant cells is involved in
carcinogenesis. In the progression of carcinogenesis, exosomes are messengers for intercellular communication.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with functions that include regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation.
However, the functions of exosomal circRNAs are not clear. The present research aimed to determine whether
circRNAs secreted from arsenite-transformed human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells are transferred into normal L-02 cells
and become functionally active in the normal cells. The results showed that circRNA_100284 is involved in the
malignant transformation of L-02 cells induced by arsenite. The medium from transformed L-02 cells induced
upregulation of circRNA_100284, accelerated the cell cycle, and promoted proliferation of normal L-02 cells.
Transformed cells transferred circRNA_100284 into normal L-02 cells via exosomes and led to the malignant
transformation of the non-transformed cells. Knockdown of circRNA_100284, which reduced circRNA_100284 levels in
exosomes derived from transformed L-02 cells, blocked the accelerated cell cycle and reduced proliferation and
malignancy. In addition, in normal L-02 cells, exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells
induced acceleration of the cell cycle and promoted proliferation via acting as a sponge of microRNA-217. Further,
exosomal circRNA_100284 was upregulated in the sera of people exposed to arsenite. Thus, exosomes derived from
transformed L-02 cells transferred circRNA_100284 to surrounding cells, which induced an accelerated cell cycle and
promoted proliferation of normal liver cells and led to the malignant transformation of the non-transformed cells. The
ﬁndings support the concept that exosomal circRNAs are involved in cell–cell communication during carcinogenesis
induced by arsenite.",0
": Factor analysis utilizes the covariance of composi-
tional variables to separate sources of ambient pollutants like
particulate matter (PM). However, meteorology causes concen-
tration variations in addition to emission rate changes. Conven-
tional positive matrix factorization (PMF) loses information from
the data because of these dilution variations. By incorporating the
ventilation coeﬃcient, dispersion normalized PMF (DN-PMF)
reduces the dilution eﬀects. DN-PMF was applied to hourly
speciated particulate composition data from a ﬁeld campaign that included the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. DN-PMF sharpened
the morning coal combustion and rush hour traﬃc peaks and lowered the daytime soil, aged sea salt, and waste incinerator
contributions that better reﬂect the actual emissions. These results identiﬁed signiﬁcant changes in source contributions after the
COVID-19 outbreak in China. During this pandemic, secondary inorganic aerosol became the predominant PM2.5 source
representing 50.5% of the mean mass. Fireworks and residential burning (32.0%), primary coal combustion emissions (13.3%),
primary traﬃc emissions (2.1%), soil and aged sea salt (1.2%), and incinerator (0.9%) represent the other contributors. Traﬃc
decreased dramatically (70%) compared to other sources. Soil and aged sea salt also decreased by 68%, likely from decreased traﬃc.

"Multi-tiered sampling approaches are common in environmental and occupational exposure
assessment, where exposures for a given individual are often modeled based on simultaneous
measurements taken at multiple indoor and outdoor sites. The monitoring data from such studies is
hierarchical by design, imposing a complex covariance structure that must be accounted for in order
to obtain unbiased estimates of exposure. Statistical methods such as structural equation modeling
(SEM) represent a useful alternative to simple linear regression in these cases, providing
simultaneous and unbiased predictions of each level of exposure based on a set of covariates specific
to the exposure setting. We test the SEM approach using data from a large exposure assessment of
diesel and combustion particles in the US trucking industry. The exposure assessment includes data
from 36 different trucking terminals across the United States sampled between 2001 and 2005,
measuring PM2.5 and its elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) components, by personal
monitoring, and sampling at two indoor work locations and an outdoor “background” location. Using
the SEM method, we predict: 1) personal exposures as a function of work related exposure and
smoking status; 2) work related exposure as a function of terminal characteristics, indoor ventilation,
job location, and background exposure conditions; and 3) background exposure conditions as a
function of weather, nearby source pollution, and other regional differences across terminal sites.
The primary advantage of SEMs in this setting is the ability to simultaneously predict exposures at
each of the sampling locations, while accounting for the complex covariance structure among the
measurements and descriptive variables. The statistically significant results and high R2 values
observed from the trucking industry application supports the broader use of this approach in exposure
assessment modeling.

"A prominent vector of aquatic invasive species to coastal regions is the discharge of water, sediments, and bioﬁlm from ships’ ballast-
water tanks. During eight years of studying ships arriving to the lower Chesapeake Bay, we developed an understanding of the mech-
anisms by which invasive microorganisms might arrive to the region via ships. Within a given ship, habitats included ballast water,
unpumpable water and sediment (collectively known as residuals), and bioﬁlms formed on internal surfaces of ballast-water tanks.
We sampled 69 vessels arriving from foreign and domestic ports, largely from Western Europe, the Mediterranean region, and the
US East and Gulf coasts. All habitats contained bacteria and viruses. By extrapolating the measured concentration of a microbial metric
to the estimated volume of ballast water, bioﬁlm, or residual sediment and water within an average vessel, we calculated the potential
total number of microorganisms contained by each habitat, thus creating a hierarchy of risk of delivery. The estimated concentration of
microorganisms was greatest in ballast water  sediment and water residuals  bioﬁlms. From these results, it is clear microorganisms
may be transported within ships in a variety of ways. Using temperature tolerance as a measure of survivability and the temperature
diﬀerence between ballast-water samples and the water into which the ballast water was discharged, we estimated 56% of microorganisms
could survive in the lower Bay. Extrapolated delivery and survival of microorganisms to the Port of Hampton Roads in lower Chesa-
peake Bay shows on the order of 1020 microorganisms (6.8 · 1019 viruses and 3.9 · 1018 bacteria cells) are discharged annually to the
region.

1. Why study microorganisms?
In the context of invasive species, the reasons for inves-
tigating the transfer of aquatic microorganisms, including
viruses, bacteria, protists, and microalgae are threefold:
their high densities in natural waters, ability to form resting
stages, and potential toxicity or pathogenicity. Aquatic
microorganisms are orders of magnitude more abundant
than macroorganisms such as copepods and ﬁsh: naturally
occurring bacteria and viruses are found in concentrations
on the order of 106–1011 l1 (e.g., Ducklow and Shiah,
1993; Proctor, 1997; Fuhrman, 1999; Wommack and Col-
well, 2000). Given such high densities, microorganisms are
transferred and introduced globally via ships in greater
numbers than any other size class of organisms. Nearly all
such
microorganisms,
incidentally,
are
innocuous
to
humans. Instead, the viruses infect naturally occurring bac-
terial and phytoplankton hosts, in which they can cause sig-
niﬁcant mortality (Fuhrman and Noble, 1996; Suttle, 2005).
Once released, microorganisms are well poised to be
invasive species. They are small, a size that facilitates their
passive dispersal. They appear to have simpler requirements
for survival than do metazoans, based upon their ubiquity
in the biosphere, including extreme environments (Deming,
1997). They predominantly reproduce asexually and grow

Marine Pollution Bulletin 55 (2007) 333–341rapidly, factors also contributing to their widespread distri-
bution. Finally, life cycles of many invertebrate metazoans
and unicellular organisms such as bacteria, eukaryotic phy-
toplankton (including toxic dinoﬂagellates), and other pro-
tist species, include resting stages (variously called cysts,
spores, auxospores, ephippia, or resting eggs according to
taxon) capable of surviving prolonged periods of unfavor-
able conditions (e.g., Bailey et al., 2003).
These resting stages are typically produced at very low
frequency, if at all, under favorable conditions, and at high
frequency when environmental conditions deteriorate (e.g.,
declining nutrient concentrations, shortened photoperiod,
or reduced food quality; Blackburn and Parker, 2005). Pro-
duction of resting stages ensures long-term viability of the
population because they are extremely resistant to adverse
conditions, including anoxia, exposure to noxious chemi-
cals, freezing, and passage through digestive tracts of ﬁsh
and waterfowl. Resting eggs of invertebrates and cysts of
dinoﬂagellates are usually negatively buoyant and sink
when released or formed. Resting stages may remain viable
in sediments in a virtual suspended metabolic state for dec-
ades or even centuries (Hairston et al., 1995) and can germi-
nate under a combination of favorable light, temperature,
and other environmental conditions (e.g., Kremp and
Anderson, 2000; Itakura and Yamaguchi, 2001; Figueroa
et al., 2006).
Pathogenic or toxic aquatic bacteria, viruses, protists,
and microalgae can have devastating eﬀects on ecosystems
and economic resources. There are well-studied pathogen–
host systems among many aquatic phyla; for example,
viruses terminating algal blooms (e.g., Milligan and Cosper,
1994; Nagasaki et al., 1994; Van Etten et al., 1991; Short
and Suttle, 2002), viruses infecting seals (e.g., Osterhaus
et al., 1985; Grachev et al., 1989), and protists decimating
seagrass beds (e.g., Muehlstein, 1992; Ralph and Short,
2002). Furthermore, the apparent increasing frequency
and distribution of toxic microalgal blooms has received
much attention in the past two decades (see reviews by Hal-
legraeﬀ, 1993; CENR, 2000). Given marine pathogens can
spread locally much more quickly than terrestrial pathogens
(even when instances of obvious human intervention are
excluded, McCallum et al., 2003), and considering the rela-
tively fast transport by ships, the threat of global dispersal
of aquatic pathogens appears more immediate than the
threat of invasion by other groups of organisms.
Thus, by virtue of their abundance, life-history charac-
teristics, and potential pathogenicity or toxicity, microor-
ganisms possess a great capacity to invade and cause
detrimental eﬀects in new environments. This paper will
explore the extent and potential consequences of bacteria
and virus transport within ships.
2. Types of habitats within ships
Microorganisms can be found in several locations within
a ship—ballast water, residual sediment and water, and
bioﬁlms formed on interior tanks surfaces—each of which
will be considered separately. Transfer among these habi-
tats has not been fully explored (although see Meyer
et al., 2000). We do not consider microorganisms within
hull fouling communities in this review.
2.1. Ballast water
Ships’ ballast waters are the best investigated of these
habitats. Although water has been used regularly as ballast
since the 1880s (Carlton, 1985), the transfer of organisms
by ballast-water discharge was investigated only sporadi-
cally until the late 1980s. The interest in ballast water at
that time stemmed largely from the dramatic ecological
and economic impacts of introduced species, such as comb
jellies (Mnemiopsis leidyi) in the Black Sea and zebra mus-
sels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the North American Great
Lakes (International Maritime Organization, 1999). Much
of the work on ballast invaders has been dedicated to
studying metazoans (Fofonoﬀet al., 2003), despite the high
densities of naturally occurring microorganisms in aquatic
environments. To test the hypothesis that vast quantities of
bacteria and viruses are carried in ships’ ballast tanks, Ruiz
et al. (2000) quantiﬁed their abundance in ballast water of
vessels arriving to Chesapeake Bay from foreign ports.
Indeed, the numbers were high: mean abundances of
8.3 · 108 bacteria l1
and
7.4 · 109
virus-like
particles
(VLPs) l1 were documented.
2.2. Sediment and water residuals
We now know ships declaring no (pumpable) ballast on
board may also serve as vectors. Concerns about no ballast
on board (NOBOB) invasions have risen from a position of
relative obscurity a few years ago to one of the chief envi-
ronmental concerns in the Great Lakes basin today (e.g.,
Grigorovich et al., 2003). The potential for NOBOB-med-
iated invasions lies within tanks’ muddy puddles; residuals
of sediment and water can contain an assortment of meta-
zoans and microorganisms, including resting stages (e.g.,
Hallegraeﬀand Bolch, 1992; Galil and Hu¨lsmann, 1997;
Gollasch et al., 1998; Hamer et al., 2000). When NOBOB
tanks are later ﬁlled with ballast water, the accumulated
sediment (and associated biota) may be resuspended and
discharged immediately or at subsequent ports of call.
Sediment accumulation can be appreciable, depending
on elapsed time since the ship was last dry-docked. For
example, double-bottom ballast tanks of a cargo vessel
contained up to 30 cm of sediment after only two years
of use (Hamer et al., 2000). While circumstances vary from
ship to ship, the unpumpable water that remains in most
vessels, together with any residual sediment, potentially
harbors nonindigenous organisms. A metastudy of 13
European studies recorded 990 species in a combination
of ballast water and sediment samples (Gollasch et al.,
2002). Furthermore, Kelly (1993) reported Japanese ships
visiting the USA carried viable cysts and spores of nonin-
digenous species after 11–15 days’ voyage. Finally, Mac-
334
L.A. Drake et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 55 (2007) 333–341Isaac et al. (2002) modeled NOBOB vessel-mediated inoc-
ulation of the Great Lakes using available plankton densi-
ties in coastal European waters, ship transit times, species’
survival curves, and residual ballast volumes; individual
NOBOB vessels potentially discharge >107 individuals of
rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods, and 1011 bacteria,
depending on conditions inside ballast tanks.
In this regard, tank sediments serve as a repository for
particles, living or otherwise, that settle from water within
the tank. With respect to issues of invasions, therefore, sed-
iment and water residuals in a NOBOB tank will contain a
temporally integrated assortment of organisms found in
the water columns that overlay it days and weeks earlier,
and possibly months and years earlier, in the case of resting
stages of organisms.
2.3. Bioﬁlms on ballast-water tank surfaces
Aquatic surfaces are colonized to some degree with
bioﬁlms, organic matrices that can contain bacteria, micro-
algae, and associated protists, sometimes including patho-
genic forms (e.g., Decho, 1990, 2000). Microorganisms in
mature bioﬁlms are notoriously resistant to chemical disin-
fectants for reasons that have yet to be satisfactorily
explained (Costerton et al., 1999). The production of exo-
polymer secretions, ‘‘slimes’’, by surface-bound bacteria is
a well-recognized—but insuﬃcient—mechanism to explain
such resistance to chemical treatment. Confocal microscopy
and other tools have demonstrated the complicated, heter-
ogeneous architecture of thick bioﬁlms (many as thick as
hundreds of micrometers, Baier, 1984; Cook et al., 2000).
In addition to providing a chemical barrier to potentially
lethal agents, bioﬁlms might also provide refuge for bacteria
from predatory protists (Hu¨lsmann et al., 2000) or promote
interactions among pathogenic bacteria and protist grazers
such that evolutionarily successful pathogens survive diges-
tion by protists or become their endosymbionts (Barker and
Brown, 1994).
For these reasons, it is worthwhile to consider ships’ bal-
last-water bioﬁlms, but there are only two such reports.
First, bioﬁlm communities formed on multiple types of arti-
ﬁcial surfaces deployed in a ballast tank during a trans-
oceanic voyage (Meyer et al., 2000). When the substrata
and associated bioﬁlms were removed and submerged in
artiﬁcial seawater, they seeded secondary bioﬁlms, which
survived for years (Meyer et al., 2000). Second, bacteria
and VLPs have been enumerated in bioﬁlms collected from
ships arriving to Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes.
Microbial concentrations were up to ten times greater
than those in ballast water, and some samples contained
potentially harmful bacteria and microalgae (Drake et al.,
2005).

numbers in cities means that we transport large volumes of resources to these areas, which gives rise to waste and 
emissions, which places a burden on the neighboring environment to the it’s limits. This leads to problems for both 
human health and society's economy, which is because the ecosystems that help us, collapse. To counter this, a 
better urban planning is required which includes the environment in society as ecosystem services. The problem 
with ecosystem services is that they do not have a commercial value, which makes it difficult to implement since 
they do not indicate any economic gain. Therefore, it is necessary to increase knowledge about how they contribute 
so that they can be correlated to how they contribute to society from three aspects: economic, social,

Mortality and incidence of cancer among Swedish
gas workers
P Gustavsson, Christina Reuterwall
Abstract
The mortality and incidence of cancer was
studied among 295 workers at a Swedish gas
production company. All men employed for at
least one year between 1965 and 1972 were
included in the study. The follow up period for
mortality was 1966 to 1986, and the incidence of
cancer was followed up from 1966 to 1983.
Expected numbers of deaths were based on
local death rates among occupationally active
men, the expected numbers of cancer were
based on national statistics. The total mor-
tality was increased, mainly due to an excess of
deaths from circulatory diseases. The excess
was larger after long follow up and after long
employment periods. Two cases of cancer in
the nose and nasal sinuses were found; there
was no excess of lung cancer. Smoking habits
were investigated for a subset ofthe cohort and
did not differ from the average for men in
large cities. The findings are discussed in rela-
tion to other studies of soot and combustion
exposed workers.
Coal gas is produced by dry distillation of bitumin-
ous coal. Coke, the residue after distillation,
is
formed as a byproduct.
The Stockholm Gas Company has produced gas
since the middle of the nineteenth century. The
current plant started in 1893 and coal gas was
produced in coke ovens from around 1918 to 1972.
Before 1918 the gas was produced in retorts and since
1972 gas has been produced by cracking ofpetroleum
products. The coke ovens were similar to those in a
coke plant and coke was an important byproduct.
Around 150 000 000 m' gas and 300 000 metric tons
coke were produced annually in the period 1950-70.

smoke from the ovens. The first study indicating an
increased risk of cancer for gas workers was publi-
shed in 1936, when Kuroda and Kawahata reported
an excess of lung cancer at a Japanese gas plant.'
Excesses of cancer of the lung and bladder were later
reported among 2449 British gas workers2 and an
excess of lung cancer was also found in a small cohort
of Danish gas workers.3 Several case reports indicate
that gas workers are also at increased risk for skin
cancer. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
have been pointed out as the most probable cause of
the excess risks.4
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) evaluated the cancer hazards for gas produc-
tion workers and concluded that there was sufficient
evidence that coal tar from destructive distillation of
coal in gas works causes skin cancer in man and there
was also sufficient evidence that certain exposures in
retort houses of older coal gasification processes are
carcinogenic and give rise to lung cancer in man.4
There was limited evidence that such occupational
exposures also cause bladder cancer. No data were
available for exposures in newer processes.
The occupational exposures associated with coal
gas production have several similarities with those in
coke plants, where coke is produced for metallurgical
purposes and gas is a byproduct. An excess of lung
cancer was reported among 4661 workers in 12 coke
plants in the United States and Canada. There was
also a tendency towards increased mortality in cancer
of the kidney and prostate.'9
An excess of lung cancer was found among 6767
English coke production workers (SMR = 117)9 and
among
1269
French
coke
production
workers
(SMR= 251).1o
An investigation of the mortality and incidence of
cancer at a Swedish coke plant was first published in
1979""1 and the study was updated in 1987.12 There
was an increased mortality from ischaemic heart
disease but no definite indications ofan excess oflung
cancer in this small cohort.
Thus there is strong evidence for an increased risk
of lung cancer among coke and gas workers, possibly
caused by exposure to PAH. In recent years an
increased risk for atherosclerotic disease has also
been reported among workers exposed to combus-
tion products and PAH. Excesses of ischaemic heart
disease
were
found
among
Swedish

sweeps,13 '4 Danish chimney sweeps,""5 tar distillation
workers,'6 and aluminium reduction plant workers.'7
The aims of the present study were to evaluate the
risk of cancer in a comparatively modern gas com-
pany and to investigate further the relation between
exposure to PAH and atherosclerosis in man.
EXPOSURE CONDITIONS AND WORK TASKS
The exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was measured
in the current plant by area sampling on top of the
ovens. In 1964 a mean level of 4 3 ,ug/m3 of BaP was
detected, (range 0 007-33 ,ug/m3).
In 1965 lower
levels were found, mean 0 52 pg/m3, range 0 021-
1-29 pg/m3.'8 Calculations indicate that Swedish coke
plants (including the current gas company) have had
exposures of the same magnitude as in American
plants.'8
Generator gas for heating the coke ovens was
produced in the steam and generator department.
Generator gas contains -around 3000 carbon mono-
xide.
In 1967 the carbon monoxide content in exhaled
air was measured among the workers at the coke
ovens and at the steam and generator central as a
surrogate for carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) levels in
blood. A mean level of 20o COHb was found in 135
samples from 29 non-smoking workers at the gen-
erator
central. Twelve
per
cent of the samples
showed levels over 500 COHb, indicating a definite
occupational exposure to carbon monoxide. In 561
samples from 63 non-smokers in the coke oven
department the mean level was 04%Vk. Only 0 4%V
of
these
samples
showed
values
over 5% COHb,
indicating that only a few of these workers were
exposed to carbon monoxide in significant amounts
(unpublished data).
In the coke department coke was sorted, transpor-
ted, and stored. The work was dusty but no hygienic
measurements are available. The byproduct workers
handled benzene; exposure levels are unknown. The
workshop and maintenance workers have had inter-
mittent exposures, since many of them have moved
all over the plant. The outside workers transported
coal from the harbour to the coke ovens and the
workers at the department for sample preparation
collected samples of coal and coke for quality control.
All workers in the gas company were exposed to dust
coated with PAHs in varying degrees.
Study population and methods
All men employed for at least one year between
1 January 1965 and 30 June 1972 were identified
from company records. Data on work tasks and
employment periods were recorded for all 300 iden-
tified individuals. Data on work tasks before 1965
were not available, however, and in calculating
employment periods all workers were assumed to
have worked in the same department before 1965 as
they did at the beginning of that year. Exposure
period was calculated as the period from actual start
of employment until separation from employment
or until 30 June 1972 when the coal gasification
stopped.
Interviews were performed with a group of older
workers and foremen in the workshop and mainten-
ance departments regarding the smoking habits of
the cohort members in these departments. Smoking
data for 950o
of the cohort members
in these
departments were obtained in this way.
Outcome was traced by a computerised register of
the living population at Stockholm County Adminis-
tration Board, death and burial books at the clerical
parishes, and Stockholm City Archives. Underlying
causes of deaths were obtained from
Statistics
Sweden and data on the incidence of cancer were
obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Mor-
tality was investigated from 1966 to 1986 and the
incidence of cancer from 1966 to 1983.
Four of the 300 cohort members had emigrated
and one was never registered in Swedish population
registers.
These
five
individuals were excluded
from the analyses. Table
1 shows the number of
individuals and average employment periods in each
department.
Expected numbers of deaths and cancers were
computed according to the person-year method,
counting years at risk for each individual, specific for
five year age class and five year calendar time class.
The OCMAP'9 and EPILIN2"" computer programs
were used for the calculations.
The reference rates for mortality were based on the
mortality in ""Greater Stockholm,"" a geographical
area including Stockholm City and the surrounding
communities. A second set of reference rates was
also
calculated,
based on
the
mortality among
occupationally active men. The rates were derived by
combining the local mortality data with information
on the mortality among employed and not employed
individuals obtained in the national census of 1960.21
This second set of rates reflects the local mortality

Discussion
There was an increased mortality from circulatory
diseases and violent deaths among the gas workers.
The possible causes, the effects of smoking habits,
and choice of reference population are discussed
below.
CIRCULATORY DISEASES
The mortality from circulatory diseases, including
ischaemic heart disease, was increased in the cohort
and the increase was more pronounced after long
follow up and after a long employment period. This
supports that the excess was caused by occupational
factors.
An increased risk of ischaemic heart disease has
been reported
also
in other
groups exposed
to
combustion products, and animal experimental data
suggest that PAH may be the causative factor.2324 In
addition,
it has been proposed that the athero-
sclerotic plaque is a benign smooth muscle neoplastic
tumour."" A recent study showed the presence of a
transforming gene in human atherosclerotic plaque
DNA, indicating that somatic cell-gene alterations
play a part in atherosclerotic plaque development.26
The largest excess of ischaemic heart disease was
found among the workshop and maintenance work-
ers and not among the coke oven workers. The coke
oven workers had considerably shorter employment
periods, however, and their cumulated exposure to
PAHs may have been lower than that for the work-
shop and maintenance workers. No definite con-
clusions may be formulated since exposure data are
lacking.
The study was limited to workers employed for
at least one year between 1965 and 1972. In 1965
the plant had already been operating for a long time
and many of the gas workers had started their
employment earlier. This leads to a lack of indi-
viduals with short employment periods in the cohort
and since the long term employed workers are a
""surviving"" population the risks may be under-
estimated.27
An excess ofischaemic heart disease was also found
among coke oven workers at a Swedish steel plant,12
although no excess has been reported among coke
oven workers or gas workers in the United States' or
United Kingdom.29 Lack of smoking data and possi-
ble bias from the healthy worker effect make direct
comparisons difficult, however.2829
OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH
There were indications of an excess of respiratory
diseases after long follow up, with three observed
cases whereas 07 would be expected. The high
exposure to dust may have played a part, although no
conclusions can be based on only three cases.
CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY
There were two cases of nasal and sinonasal cancer
whereas only 007 would be expected. An association
with exposure to chemicals in the workplace could be
explained by deposition in the nasal mucosa of dust
particles
of large
diameters
coated
with PAH.

Increased risks for nose and sinonasal cancer have
been found among wood (furniture) workers,3032 but
not among gas or coke oven workers.
Neither the incidence nor the mortality of lung
cancer was increased. This agrees with the findings
in the Swedish cohort of coke oven workers'2 but
deviates from the excess found among coke oven
workers in the United States.
The reason for the normal rate of lung cancer is
obscure. The explanation for the non-positive find-
ings may be the high turnover rate ofthe workforce at
the coke ovens, leading
to
a comparatively low
cumulated dose of PAHs. The number of expected
cases was small and chance may also have contributed
to the normal finding.
SMOKING HABITS
Fifty two per cent of the workshop and maintenance
workers were daily smokers. The smoking habits in a
sample ofthe Swedish population comprising 55 000
subjects were investigated in 1963."" In large cities in
ages 18-49 57% were daily smokers and in ages 50-69
56% were smokers. Although a different method was
used for collecting data in our study, it seems as ifthe
workshop and maintenance workers had smoking
habits similar to those in the reference population
and the excess ofcirculatory diseases does not seem to
be caused by tobacco smoking.
REFERENCE RATES FOR MORTALITY
The SMRs based on occupationally active men as
referents were derived to reduce the bias from the
healthy worker effect.2' The error introduced by the
approximations seem to be small and the magnitude
of the healthy worker effect was similar to what has
been found in other studies.' These rates have been
given preference in the evaluation.

"Objectives Previous studies of chimney sweeps have
shown an excess mortality from cardiovascular diseases,
although the extent of confounding from tobacco
smoking is uncertain. The present study used referents of
similar socioeconomic background as the chimney
sweeps in order to reduce confounding, included both
lethal and surviving cases of myocardial infarction, and
investigated dose–response in terms of duration of
employment.
Methods A cohort of 4436 male chimney sweeps was
identiﬁed from nationwide trade union records from
1918 to 2006. Myocardial infarctions during 1991–
2005 were identiﬁed from the Swedish nationwide
register of ﬁrst-time myocardial infarctions. Standardised
incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated using skilled
manual workers in the service sector in Sweden to
calculate expected numbers.
Results There was a strong and statistically signiﬁcant
excess of myocardial infarction among the chimney
sweeps, SIR 1.39 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.55). The excess
was observed among both short- and long-term
employed.
Conclusions While the excess of myocardial infarction
among the short-term employed may be due to tobacco
and, possibly, alcohol use, it is likely that the excess
noted among the long-term employed was caused by
the high exposure to combustion products, particles or
metals still occurring among chimney sweeps. Preventive
measures to reduce hazardous occupational exposures as
well as smoking and alcohol use among chimney sweeps
are urgently needed.",0
"The conversion of waste to energy through briquetting has the potential for providing energy, while simultaneously 
reducing wastes and their environmental health risks. The current study developed and evaluated high-energy fuel 
briquettes from mixtures of coal dust, biowastes and postconsumer plastics. Five waste mix ratios (wt%) of coal dust 
(C), postconsumer plastics (P) and sawdust (S) were tested: (1) C50-40–S10, (2) C-60–P30–S10, (3) C70–P20–S10, (4) 
C-80–P20–S0 and (5) C-80A–P0–S20. Waste mix ratio had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on water absorption, shatter 
index, compressive strength and energy values, but had no effect on density. The densities (1.1–1.3 g/cm3) and shat-
ter indices (94–98%) of all briquettes conformed to international standard specifications for fuel briquettes, indicating 
that the briquettes had acceptable handling properties. A waste mixture ratio of 50% coal dust, 40% plastics and 10% 
sawdust (C50–P40–S10) produced a briquette with the best overall combination of handling and energy properties. The 
high-energy briquettes had calorific values of 26.5–33.8 MJ/kg, which were significantly higher than or comparable to 
the maximum values reported for high-energy coal (27 MJ/kg), while the compressive strength was 0.7 MPa. Potential 
applications of the briquettes include (1) household and institutional heating and cooking and (2) industrial heating in 
kilns, furnaces, smelters, curing and drying of crops (e.g., tobacco barns. Further work is required to address the following: 
(1) evaluation of the detailed physicochemical, combustion and emission properties, (2) optimization of the briquetting 
process, (3) cost estimation of the briquettes relative to existing competing solid fuels and (4) comparative performance 
evaluation of the briquettes versus conventional solid fuels in the various applications.

"Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) in the near-roadway environment is associated with 
multiple adverse health effects. To characterize the relative contribution of tailpipe and non-tailpipe 
TRAP sources to particulate matter (PM) in the quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5–10) 
size fractions and identify their spatial determinants in southern California (CA). Month-long inte­
grated PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 samples (n = 461, 265 and 298, respectively) were collected across 
cool and warm seasons in 8 southern CA communities (2008–9). Concentrations of PM mass, 
elements, carbons and major ions were obtained. Enrichment ratios (ER) in PM0.2 and PM10 relative to 
PM2.5 were calculated for each element. The Positive Matrix Factorization model was used to resolve 
and estimate the relative contribution of TRAP sources to PM in three size fractions. Generalized 
additive models (GAMs) with bivariate loess smooths were used to understand the geographic 
variation of TRAP sources and identify their spatial determinants. EC, OC, and B had the highest 
median ER in PM0.2 relative to PM2.5. Six, seven and five sources (with characteristic species) were 
resolved in PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, respectively. Combined tailpipe and non-tailpipe traffic sources 
contributed 66%, 32% and 18% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 mass, respectively. Tailpipe traffic 
emissions (EC, OC, B) were the largest contributor to PM0.2 mass (58%). Distinct gasoline and diesel 
tailpipe traffic sources were resolved in PM2.5. Others included fuel oil, biomass burning, secondary 
inorganic aerosol, sea salt, and crustal/soil. CALINE4 dispersion model nitrogen oxides, trucks and 
intersections were most correlated with TRAP sources. The influence of smaller roadways and 
intersections became more apparent once Long Beach was excluded. Non-tailpipe emissions con­
stituted ~8%, 11% and 18% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, respectively, with important exposure and 
health implications. Future efforts should consider non-linear relationships amongst predictors when 
modeling exposures.
Implications: Vehicle emissions result in a complex mix of air pollutants with both tailpipe and non- 
tailpipe components. As mobile source regulations lead to decreased tailpipe emissions, the relative 
contribution of non-tailpipe traffic emissions to near-roadway exposures is increasing. This study 
documents the presence of non-tailpipe abrasive vehicular emissions (AVE) from brake and tire wear, 
catalyst degradation and resuspended road dust in the quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), fine and coarse 
particulate matter size fractions, with contributions reaching up to 30% in PM0.2 in some southern 
California communities. These findings have important exposure and policy implications given the 
high metal content of AVE and the efficiency of PM0.2 at reaching the alveolar region of the lungs and 
other organ systems once inhaled. This work also highlights important considerations for building 
models that can accurately predict tailpipe and non-tailpipe exposures for population health studies.

Effective density of inhaled environmental 
and engineered nanoparticles and its impact 
on the lung deposition and dosimetry

Abstract 
Background  Airborne environmental and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are inhaled and deposited in the res-
piratory system. The inhaled dose of such NPs and their deposition location in the lung determines their impact 
on health. When calculating NP deposition using particle inhalation models, a common approach is to use the bulk 
material density, ρb, rather than the effective density, ρeff. This neglects though the porous agglomerate structure 
of NPs and may result in a significant error of their lung-deposited dose and location.
Results  Here, the deposition of various environmental NPs (aircraft and diesel black carbon, wood smoke) and engi-
neered NPs (silica, zirconia) in the respiratory system of humans and mice is calculated using the Multiple-Path Particle 
Dosimetry model accounting for their realistic structure and effective density. This is done by measuring the NP 
ρeff which was found to be up to one order of magnitude smaller than ρb. Accounting for the realistic ρeff of NPs 
reduces their deposited mass in the pulmonary region of the respiratory system up to a factor of two in both human 
and mouse models. Neglecting the ρeff of NPs does not alter significantly the distribution of the deposited mass frac-
tions in the human or mouse respiratory tract that are obtained by normalizing the mass deposited at the head, tra-
cheobronchial and pulmonary regions by the total deposited mass. Finally, the total deposited mass fraction derived 
this way is in excellent agreement with those measured in human studies for diesel black carbon.
Conclusions  The doses of inhaled NPs are overestimated by inhalation particle deposition models when the ρb 
is used instead of the real-world effective density which can vary significantly due to the porous agglomerate struc-
ture of NPs. So the use of realistic ρeff, which can be measured as described here, is essential to determine the lung 
deposition and dosimetry of inhaled NPs and their impact on public health.

Background
Over the  past century, the  exposure of  humans to air-
borne environmental and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) 
has increased dramatically due to air pollution, techno-
logical advancements and use in nano-enabled products 
across the value chain and various industries [1–6]. Such 
nanoscale particles share unique physicochemical prop-
erties that stem from their small size and large surface 
area, chemistry and reactivity  and render them rather 
toxic to human health [7].
In particular, environmental and engineered NPs have 
been linked with a variety of pulmonary [8–11], cardio-
vascular [12–15] and other effects [16–19], even though 
the  underlying mechanisms are still not well under-
stood. It is worth noting that given the continuous rise 
of air pollution due to climate change [20, 21], as well as 
the emerging markets for engineered nanomaterials [22], 
it is essential to get a better understanding of the impact 
of these NPs on public health.
Most of the (primary) airborne environmental pollut-
ants, such as black carbon (BC) or wood smoke, are emit-
ted from combustion sources, including engines, coal or 
biomass combustors and wildfires [23–25]. In addition 
to environmental pollutants, combustion contributes 
decisively to the formation of nanostructured commodi-
ties, including carbon black, silica  and titania  that are 
produced in flame reactors [22]. The environmental and 
engineered NPs formed during these processes coagulate 
into porous, fractal-like clusters (i.e. agglomerates) [26, 
27]. The  size of  these agglomerates is commonly quan-
tified by their mobility and aerodynamic diameters [28] 
that vary significantly between materials and combus-
tion sources and processes, as summarized in Table  1. 
The agglomerate porosity is determined by the effective 
density, ρeff, that is defined here as the ratio of the particle 
mass and equivalent mobility volume and is just a frac-
tion of the material bulk density, ρb [28, 29]. The small 
agglomerate ρeff affects the gravitational settling, inertial 
impaction and diffusion of NPs [30] and thus affects their 
lung deposition and dosimetry.
In nanotoxicology research, both in vivo animal stud-
ies as well as in vitro cellular approaches are employed to 
assess potential toxicological endpoints [31, 32]. Particle 
lung deposition models such as the Multiple-Path Parti-
cle Dosimetry (MPPD) [33, 34] and International Com-
mission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [35] models, 
are often used to determine the lung deposited dose using 
the airborne exposure levels of inhaled NPs. For example, 
MPPD has been recently used by the authors and others 
to derive the  inhaled dose of  ambient particulate mat-
ter [36–38], BC [39, 40], wood smoke [41], titania [42], 
ceria [31, 43], micro- and nanoplastics [44], nano-ena-
bled products [45], printer emitted particles [46, 47] and 
e-cigarette [48] emissions using ρb rather than ρeff. From 
the  calculated in  vivo lung-deposited dose, the in  vitro 
administered dose can also be back-calculated using 
in vitro particle-kinetic dosimetry models, as described 
in detail by the authors in previous publications [3, 31, 
45, 49, 50]. It should be noted that the effective density 
for in vitro particle dosimetry is defined as the density of 
the formed agglomerate in a culture medium [49, 50].Page 3 of 11
Lizonova et al. Particle and Fibre Toxicology            (2024) 21:7 
	
For simplicity, MPPD is commonly employed using ρb 
which can differ significantly from the  ρeff. [31, 38, 39]. 
This oversimplification may limit though the  accuracy 
of  MPPD calculations for various environmental and 
engineered NPs that form agglomerates with small ρeff 
[26]. For example, the total deposited mass of ceria NPs 
measured in mice was overestimated by MPPD using 
the  ceria  ρb by up to a  factor of  two [43]. Similarly, 
the mass of diesel BC deposited in the human respiratory 
system obtained using ρb (1 g/cm3) was a factor of two 
larger than that derived using the measured ρeff [51].
In this regard, the development and commercialization 
of  aerosol particle mass (APM) analyzers have enabled 
the accurate measurement of the NP ρeff [52–55]. During 
APM measurements, NPs pass through an electric field 
between two rotating cylindrical electrodes. By adjust-
ing the electric field potential and the rotating electrode 
angular velocity, the particle mass [52], volume fraction 
[56] and consequently ρeff [57] can be measured. It should 
be noted that APM is well suited for characterization of 
NP agglomerates, but its accuracy is not well established 
for elongated particles (e.g. fibers or tubes). For example, 
the alignment of such particles in an external electric 
field [58] can result in measurement errors up to 7% [59]. 
In addition to the APM analyzers, ρeff can be also meas-
ured using electrical low pressure [60] or hypersonic 
impactors [61] and time-of-flight mass spectrometers 
[62]. The agglomerate ρeff can be obtained also in vivo by 
fitting the MPPD simulations to the measured lung bur-
den [63].
So, APM analyzers have been used to obtain the  ρeff 
of  environmental NPs, including wood smoke [64], BC 
emissions from diesel [57, 65], gasoline [66, 67] and 
marine [68] engines, as well as that of engineered nano-
materials (e.g. carbon black [69], silica [70], zirconia 
[71]). The ρeff measured that way has facilitated the deri-
vation and validation of advanced computational models 
[72] for the  particle morphology [26], light absorption 
[73, 74], scattering [75, 76] and even climate impact [77].
Here, APM is used to demonstrate how to measure 
the ρeff of model environmental NPs, namely, aircraft-like 
BC from enclosed jet fuel combustion [78]. The aircraft 
BC ρeff obtained here, as well as those of other model 
NPs obtained from the literature for diesel BC [65], wood 
smoke [64], silica [70] and zirconia [71] (summarized in 
Table 1) are used in MPPD to determine the error from 
dose calculations derived using the commonly used pris-
tine material bulk density. The deposited mass distribu-
tions derived using ρeff are validated with experimental 
data  of  human  exposure diesel BC emissions [65] and 
compared to those obtained commonly in the literature 
using ρb.
Results and discussion
Effective density of environmental and engineered NPs
Figure 1 shows the ρeff measured for various model NPs 
such as aircraft (squares, this work) or diesel BC (cir-
cles [65]), wood smoke (diamonds [64]), silica (triangles 
[70]) and zirconia  (inverse triangles [71]) as a  function 
of  their  mobility diameter, dm. The  raw ρeff data pre-
sented in Fig.  1 have been obtained for NP agglom-
erates with distinct dm. The  NP ρeff decreases up to 
a  factor of  about four with increasing dm due to their

fractal-like, agglomerate morphology, which is consist-
ent with theoretical [26] and empirical [79] power laws 
derived for agglomerates. The ρeff of zirconia NPs is up 
to factor of  two larger than  those of  BC, wood smoke 
and silica due to their larger ρb (see Table 1). Similarly, 
the ρeff measured here for aircraft BC is up to a factor of 
1.4 smaller than that of diesel BC and wood smoke NP 
agglomerates having the  same dm. The  bulk density, ρb, 
is practically the same for aircraft, diesel BC and wood 
smoke primary particles (Table 1). So, this ρeff difference 
can be attributed to the diameter of about 28 nm of die-
sel BC [65] and wood smoke [64] primary particles that 
is 50% larger than the diameter of aircraft BC primary 
particles (12 nm [78]). This is consistent with theoretical 
power laws showing that ρeff increases with the primary 
particle diameter [26]. It is worth noting that the ρeff pre-
sented here for environmental and engineered NPs is up 
to an order of magnitude smaller than the respective ρb.
Using the  measured ρeff along with the  entire mobil-
ity size distribution, one can obtain the overall NP mass 
median mobility diameter (MMMD), as well as the mass 
median  aerodynamic diameter (MMAD; see Methods). 
The latter is essential for the estimation of the NP lung 
deposition and dose. Even though zirconia NPs have 
larger ρeff compared to silica (Fig.  1), their dm obtained 
from the  entire size distribution is about 30% smaller. 
This explains the MMMD of silica NPs that is 27% larger 
than that of zirconia ones. Table 1 summarizes the count 
median  diameter (CMD), MMMD, MMAD, ρb and ρeff 
of agglomerates having MMAD and MMMD for all NPs 
used in this study. For example, diesel BC agglomerates 
with MMAD = 152.8  nm and MMMD = 349.5  nm have 
ρeff = 0.28  g/cm3, which is within the ρeff = 0.96–0.26  g/
cm3 measured for agglomerates with dm = 50–368  nm 
(Fig. 1: circles [65]).
Lung deposition calculations and validation of MPPD 
dosimetric calculations with human experimental 
data using ρeff
Lung deposition of  inhaled NPs was simulated using 
MPPD with realistic ρeff (Fig.  2) and validated with 
measurements for the case of diesel BC [65]. The depos-
ited mass fractions derived here by MPPD accounting 
for the  realistic ρeff of  diesel BC are in excellent agree-
ment with the  measured ones, validating the  MPPD 
simulations presented in this work. In particular, Fig. 2 
compares the  mass fraction of  deposited diesel BC as 
a  function of  its dm derived by MPPD using ρeff (line) 
to those measured from 9 human  subjects exposed to 
the exhaust of a real diesel engine (symbols [65]). These 
data  were obtained using the  dm distributions meas-
ured in the  inhaled and exhaled air. The  ρeff used in 
MPPD is varied with dm using Eq. 2 (see Methods) with 
mass-mobility exponent and prefactor derived by fitting 
Eq. 2 to the ρeff measured for diesel BC (see Additional 
file 1: Table S1). At this size range, the deposition of die-
sel BC particles by diffusion, inertial impaction and gravi-
tational settling decreases with increasing dm [80, 81], 
reducing the total deposited mass fraction.
Impact of ρb and ρeff on lung deposition dose calculations
The  deposited mass of  environmental and engineered 
NPs in the respiratory tract of humans (Fig. 3) and mice 
(Fig.  4) was calculated using the  MPPD model with 
the measured ρeff (filled bars) or ρb (open bars) under the 
same input parameters. It is worth noting that MPPD, 
like any other model, has its own limitations and more 
studies are needed to validate the model for the various 
conditions and animal models. In humans (Fig. 3), using 
ρb rather than ρeff results in an overestimation of the total 
deposited mass by a factor of about two for all environ-
mental and engineered NPs investigated here. Neglect-
ing the realistic agglomerate ρeff affects also the regional 
distribution of the  deposited mass. For example, using 
ρb in MPPD overestimates the deposited mass of aircraft 
BC in the head human airways by just 17.1%. However, 
the  deposited aircraft BC mass in the  tracheobronchial 
and pulmonary regions is overestimated using ρb by 74.4 
and 80.2%, respectively. 
The overestimation of the deposited mass of NPs can 
be attributed to the  enhancement of  the  particle iner-
tial impaction in the  TB and pulmonary regions when 
large ρb is used instead of the realistic ρeff [30]. It should 
be noted that gravitational settling hardly contributes to 
the density effects observed here (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S1). So, the  ρb is commonly assumed in literature esti-
mations of  inhaled NP deposition and dosimetry when 
Fig. 2  Mass fraction of deposited diesel BC NPs measured (symbols

the realistic ρeff is either not known, or for the purpose 
of simplifying the calculations [38, 39, 43]. This can how-
ever lead to significant error in the NP deposition calcu-
lation, as is shown here.
Figure  3 shows that most of the  particles are depos-
ited in the  tracheobronchial (TB) and pulmonary (P) 
regions of the human respiratory system, where the dep-
osition is governed by diffusion, inertial impaction and

gravitational settling [80–82]. Therefore, the  largest 
deposited mass was obtained for zirconia NPs. These 
NPs are described by small MMAD compared to those 
of diesel BC and wood smoke which enhances their dep-
osition by diffusion [80, 82]. Moreover, zirconia NPs are 
described by high ρb and ρeff compared to those of air-
craft BC and silica, which further enhance their inertial 
impaction [30]. In the head airways of the human respira-
tory system, only few particles are deposited in all cases, 
where this is done by an impaction mechanism [80, 81, 
83].
The impact of ρeff on the estimation of the NP depos-
ited dose is similar for both human and mouse models, as 
shown in Fig. 4. So, neglecting the realistic ρeff and calcu-
lating with ρb instead results in an overestimation of the 
total NP deposited mass in mouse lungs by up to a factor 
of about two. The largest mass deposited in the TB and 
pulmonary regions is obtained here for zirconia, consist-
ent with the masses derived for zirconia NPs inhaled by 
humans (Fig. 3).
In summary, Table 2 shows the total mass of deposited 
NPs in the human and mouse respiratory tracts derived 
by MPPD using ρb or ρeff. The overestimation of the total 
deposited mass by a  factor of  1.5–2 obtained here 
using MPPD with ρb is consistent with those reported 
in literature for engineered [43] and environmental 
[51] NPs. Clearly, the  dose of  inhaled engineered and 
environmental NPs can be overestimated substantially by 
MPPD using ρb, limiting the assessment of their impact 
on pulmonary [8, 9] and cardiovascular diseases [12–15].
Furthermore, Fig.  5 shows the  distribution across 
the  respiratory system of  the  deposited mass fraction 
of inhaled aircraft BC NPs by humans (a) and mice (b) 
derived here by MPPD using ρb (open bars) or ρeff (filled 
bars). The  deposited mass fraction is obtained by nor-
malizing the  mass deposited in the  head, TB or pul-
monary region of  the  tract with respect to the  total 
deposited mass. Accounting for the  realistic ρeff of  air-
craft BC reduces its inertial impaction in all regions 
of  the  human  or mouse respiratory tract and does not 
alter significantly the distribution of the deposited mass 
fractions. The  distributions of  the  deposited mass frac-
tions derived here for diesel BC, wood smoke, silica and 
zirconia are similar to those obtained for aircraft BC and 
presented in Additional file 1: Fig. S2.
Conclusions
In sum, the  error in NP lung deposition dose calcula-
tions which is derived using the ρb rather than the actual 
ρeff of NPs was assessed here using a variety of model 
environmental and engineered NPs. As shown, the  ρeff 
measured here for aircraft black carbon (BC) NPs using 
an APM is one order of magnitude smaller than ρb and 
follows closely those measured in literature for diesel BC

[65], wood smoke [64], silica [70] and zirconia [71]. It was 
shown that the MPPD-derived mass fraction of diesel BC 
NPs deposited in the human lungs is in excellent agree-
ment with experimental data [65], validating the impor-
tance of using the realistic ρeff rather than the commonly 
used ρb.
More importantly, it was shown that using ρb and 
neglecting the  realistic porous structure of  environ-
mental and engineered NPs results in an  overestima-
tion of  their deposited mass by a  factor of  about two. 
This can be attributed to the NP inertial impaction that 
is overestimated by MPPD using ρb instead of ρeff. This 
may explain similar discrepancies reported in litera-
ture for ceria [43] and diesel BC [51] NPs and highlights 
the role of ρeff in the modeling of lung deposition of NPs. 
So, the use of realistic ρeff in lung deposition models is 
essential to determine the dose of inhaled NPs, enabling 
the accurate assessment of their impact on human health.
Methods
Synthesis of aircraft‑like BC NPs and measurement of their 
size and effective density
Aircraft-like BC NPs were generated here by enclosed 
spray combustion of jet A fuel at an effective equivalence 
ratio of 1.77 [78]. The morphology, composition, nano-
structure and primary particle size distribution of the BC 
NPs emitted by the present reactor (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S3) are in excellent agreement with those measured from 
real aircraft engines [84, 85]. So, the aircraft-like BC pro-
duced here was sampled using a straight tube and rapidly 
diluted by a factor of about 65 [71]. The diluted aerosol 
was directed to a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) 
made of  a  differential mobility analyzer (Model 3081, 
TSI Inc.) coupled with a  condensation particle coun-
ter (Model 3775, TSI Inc.) [71]. The CMD and MMMD 
of  the  dm distribution obtained by SMPS are given in 
Table  1. The  mass, m, of  the  sampled aerosol was also 
measured by interfacing an aerosol particle mass (APM, 
Model APM-3600, Kanomax) analyzer with the  SMPS 
[86]. That way, the ρeff can be derived from first principles 
[28]:
The NP agglomerate ρeff measured this way decreases 
with dm based on a power law [87]:
where k and Dfm are the  mass-mobility prefactor and 
exponent, respectively. The NP agglomerate k and Dfm

were derived by fitting Eq. 2 to the data shown in Fig. 1 
(Additional file 1: Table S1). So, ρeff can be estimated for 
any dm using Eq. 2 and the fitted k and Dfm. MMAD was 
derived based on the measured MMMD and ρeff [87, 88]:
where ρo = 1  g/cm3 is the  unitary density and CC is 
the Cunningham slip correction factor [80]:
where d = MMMD or MMAD and λ = 66 nm is the gas 
mean free path at room temperature [80]. The MMAD 
was obtained for aircraft BC NPs generated here, as well 
as for the diesel BC [65], wood smoke [64], silica [70] and 
zirconia [71] NPs using ρeff and dm distribution data avail-
able in the literature (Table 1).
Simulation of NP deposition in the respiratory system 
using MPPD model
The  MPPD model (V3.04) was used here to simulate 
the  deposition of  inhaled engineered and environmen-
tal NPs in the lung airway from the head to the alveolar 
region [33, 34, 89, 90]. MPPD  calculations for humans 
were done using the  Yeh/Schum symmetric model [91] 
with a functional residual capacity of 3300 mL and head 
volume of  50  mL [92]. The  nasal respiratory rate (RR) 
was set to 12 breaths/minute, the tidal volume (TV) to 
625 mL and the inspiratory fraction to 0.5 [92]. MPPD 
calculations were also done for mice using the  mouse 
BALB/c model [33] with body weight of 30 g [93]. The RR 
of 224 breaths/min and TV of 0.22 mL derived for mice 
using the  allometric scaling equations of Guyton et  al. 
[94] and Piccione et al. [95], respectively, were used for 
input into MPPD. The functional residual capacity (FRC) 
of 0.3 mL was used to be consistent with the measured 
range of 0.20–0.43 mL [96]. The upper respiratory tract 
(URT) volume of 0.0322  mL used here is the  default 
MPPD value, which is based on experimental measure-
ments [93] and is commonly utilized in MPPD simula-
tions [97, 98]. Both humans and mice were assumed to 
be exposed to a particle concentration of 0.01 mg/m3 at 
“upright” and “on stomach” body orientations, respec-
tively. The latter is consistent with in vivo conscious ani-
mal studies [99]. The mass concentration of 0.01 mg/m3 is 
the proposed ­PM2.5 limit by United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) [100]. It should be noted that 
­PM2.5 contains larger particles than those investigated 
here that are largely contained in the ­PM0.1 aerodynamic

size fraction. In this regard, the  mass concentration of 
­PM0.1 emissions from the  combustion sources investi-
gated here are often much larger than the  EPA ­PM2.5 
limit used here. For example, mass concentrations of 
3.3–26, 0.6–0.8 and 0.004–0.5  mg/m3 have been meas-
ured from pinewood [24], diesel [101], and jet fuel [102] 
combustion, respectively. The  MPPD parameters are 
summarized in Additional file  1: Table  S2. The  inhaled 
NPs were assumed to be monodisperse having the meas-
ured MMAD and ρeff (Table 1) or the constant bulk den-
sities, ρb = 1.8, 1.7, 2.2 and 5.7 g/cm3 for BC, wood smoke, 
silica and zirconia, respectively. The wood smoke ρb is 
obtained based on the measured organic carbon con-
tent and empirical ρb relations [74]. The deposited mass 
is calculated from the MPPD-derived regional deposited 
mass rate per minute (µg/min) by integrating over 40 h 
of exposure (equivalent to 8 h per day, 5 days per week), 
as previously described by Bitounis et al. [10]. It is worth 
noting that MPPD, despite its wide use in the nanotoxi-
cology domain, has its own limitations (like any other 
available inhalation dosimetry model) and further valida-
tion studies related to its proposed conditions and animal 
models will be useful in advancing the dosimetry field.
The impact of the ρeff variation with dm on the MPPD 
calculations was also investigated here. To this end, 
the lung deposition of aircraft BC was simulated assum-
ing monodisperse particles with MMAD, as well as 
accounting for their polydispersity by discretizing their 
dm distribution into 10 bins (Additional file 1: Table S3) 
using Eq. 2 with k, Dfm derived by fitting Eq. 2 to the ρeff 
measured for aircraft BC (Additional file  1: Table  S1). 
Accounting for the  geometric standard deviation of 
the mobility size distribution, as well as for the ρeff vari-
ation with dm decreased the total deposited mass just by 
6% (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). Therefore, the lung depo-
sition of inhaled NPs can be estimated rather accurately 
neglecting their polydispersity.

Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health
challenge globally. The burden of COPD is high in never-smokers but little is known about
its causes. We aimed to ﬁnd the prevalence and correlates of COPD in never-smokers,
with a special focus on solid fuel exposure.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Western China. COPD was deﬁned
by FEV1/FVC < lower limits of normal (LLN). Descriptive statistics and multivariable
logistic regression were used for analyses.
Results: Six thousand two hundred and seventy one patients were enrolled between
June 2015 and August 2016. The prevalence of COPD in never-smokers was 15.0%
(95% conﬁdence interval 14.1–15.9). The common independent predictors of COPD in
never-smokers included age ≥60 years, exposure to solid fuel, living in a rural area and a
history of tuberculosis. Participants with solid fuel exposure were 69% more likely to have
COPD (adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.41–2.04) than those without such exposure.
In addition, we found a positive association between small airway dysfunction and solid
fuel exposure (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18–1.53).
Conclusions:
This study conﬁrmed the substantial burden of COPD among never-
smokers and also deﬁned the risk factors for COPD in never-smokers. Furthermore,
we found a positive association between solid fuel exposure and COPD or small
airway dysfunction.
Keywords: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, never-smokers, prevalence, solid fuel, small airway

INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health challenge globally, with high
prevalence, morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Cigarette smoking is regarded as a major risk factor
for COPD (3–5), but never-smokers comprise a substantial proportion of patients suﬀering from
COPD (6). Indeed, it has been estimated that 25–45% of COPD patients are never-smokers (6, 7).
The burden of COPD in never-smokers is thus substantial in developed and developing countries
(7, 8).Long et al.
Solid Fuel and COPD in Never-Smokers
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
about half of the global population depends on solid fuel for
domestic cooking or heating (9). Burning of solid fuel produces
large amounts of health-damaging chemicals (10, 11). Exposure
to solid fuel has been linked to a range of adverse health
outcomes including lung cancer, COPD and pneumonia in
adults, especially among women (12–14).
Numerous studies have been carried out to evaluate the
prevalence and risk factors of COPD, while fewer studies have
focused solely on never-smokers. In a recent nationwide cross-
sectional study in China, more than half of the COPD patients
were never-smokers (15). In Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet)
and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), solid fuel
were generally used, with more than half of households relying
on solid fuel for cooking or heating (16). We aimed to assess
the prevalence and correlates of COPD among never-smokers in
Tibet and Xinjiang, with a particular focus on solid fuel exposure.
METHODS
Study Setting
We performed a cross-sectional study on the prevalence and
determinants of COPD among people living in Xinjiang and
Tibet, China. Xinjiang and Tibet are the largest and second largest
provincial-level autonomous regions in China, located along the
western border of China. The Institutional Review Board and
ethics committee of Beijing Hospital (2013BJYYEC-042C-01)
approved the protocol of this study.
Participants
Detailed methods of the study have been described previously
(17). Between June 2015 and August 2016, a multistage stratiﬁed
sampling procedure was conducted to select a representative
sample of subjects living in Xinjiang and Tibet. First, 13
districts or counties were selected in both urban (2 districts)
and rural areas (11 counties) using the probability proportional
to size method. Second, a simple random sampling method
was adopted; two streets or townships were selected from each
district or county, and three communities or village communities
were selected from each street or township. Third, we randomly
selected individuals aged 15 years or older from the selected
communities or villages. The proportion of samples from each
gender and age group was based on the 2010 census of Chinese
population. We chose only one participant from each household.
We included permanent residents (who had lived at their
current residence for 1 year or longer) aged ≥15 years for
this analysis. Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy;
myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident experienced
during the previous 3 months; heart rate >120 beats/min or
blood pressure >180/120 mmHg; and being physically incapable

of undergoing a spirometry test, such as due to recently
undergoing thoracic, abdominal, or eye surgery, or retinal
detachment. Each participant received detailed information
about the study and study methods, and provided written
informed consent before data collection.
Operational Deﬁnition
Trained and certiﬁed technicians performed pulmonary function
tests for all participants. We performed daily calibration
with a 3 L syringe and also recorded ambient temperature,
humidity and altitude daily. Forced expiratory volumes were
measured using the MasterScreenTM Pneumo PC spirometer
(CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA) before and 20 min after the
administration of 400 µg of salbutamol through a 500 ml
spacer. Each spirogram was centrally reviewed and scored based
on the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory

Solid Fuel and COPD in Never-Smokers
Society (ATS/ERS) acceptability and reproducibility criteria (18).
We deﬁned: (1) COPD as a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC
below the lower limit of normal (LLN) of the Global Lung
Function Initiative (GLI) 2012 multiethnic equations (19); and
(2) small airway dysfunction on the basis of at least two of the
following three indicators of lung function being <65% of the
predicted level: maximal mid-expiratory ﬂow (MMEF), forced
expiratory ﬂow (FEF) 50% and FEF 75% (20). We calculated
the ratios of observed to predicted FEV1 based on GLI 2012
multiethnic equations and used them to stage the degree of
obstruction (GOLD stage I, ≥80% predicted; GOLD stage II,
≥50–<80% predicted; GOLD stage III, ≥30–<50% predicted;
and GOLD stage IV, <30% predicted) (19). Moreover, we used
a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70, according to 2021
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
guidelines (1), deﬁne COPD in a sensitivity analysis.
Never-smokers were deﬁned as a participant who has

her lifetime (21). Passive smoking was deﬁned as inhalation
of smoke by never-smokers who lived with smokers. Solid
fuel was deﬁned based on whether the participant had
used an open ﬁre with charcoal, coal, coke, wood, crop
residues or dung as the primary means of cooking or
heating for more than 6 months in their lifetime. History
of tuberculosis was deﬁned as a positive answer to the
question “Has a doctor or other health care provider ever told
you that you had tuberculosis?” Peripheral oxygen saturation
was measured by pulse-oximetry (PHILIPS DB12) before
performing spirometry.
Participants were considered to have: (1) chronic cough if they
have a cough for most of the day for as much as 3 consecutive
months during a year; (2) chronic phlegm if they bring up phlegm
for most of the day for as much as 3 consecutive months during
a year; (3) recurrent wheezing if their chest (lungs) ever sounded
wheezy (whistling sound); (4) dyspnea in daily life if they were

Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics such as count and percentage for categorical
variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous
variables were determined separately for men and women.
We conducted independent Student’s t-test and χ2 test for
continuous and categorical variables, respectively. We performed
univariable logistic regression to determine the distribution of
the study subjects by the independent variable of interest and
to see crude association. Meanwhile, we used multivariable
logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, body mass index
(BMI), education, education, residence, history of tuberculosis,
exposure to solid fuel, exposure to passive smoking, and exposure
to dust or chemicals in the workplace with adjusted odds
ratio. In the sensitivity analyses, we applied a ﬁxed cut-oﬀto
determine COPD.
All statistical analyses were performed using R with ggplot2,
forestplot and ordinal packages (www.r-project.org). For all tests,
the p-value was set to <0.05 to determine signiﬁcance.
RESULTS
Population Characteristics
Between June 2015 and August 2016, a total of 12,991 individuals
were randomly selected and invited to participate in the survey, of
whom 6,271 never-smokers consented and completed the study
(Supplementary Figure 1).
The characteristics of the 6,271 participants are presented in
Table 1. The average age (SD) among the participants was 39.7
(15.6) years, and the mean BMI was 24.2 (4.1) Kg/m2, with 68.1%
of the subjects being women. Overall, 83.8% of participants were
lived in rural areas, 70.8% were exposed to solid fuel, 21.1% were
exposed to passive smoking, 3.9% had a history of tuberculosis.
Epidemiology of COPD
The overall prevalence of LLN-deﬁned COPD was 15.0% (95%
CI 14.1–15.9) in the never-smoking population aged 15 years or
older (Table 2). There was no diﬀerence in COPD prevalence (P
= 0.94) between men and women. The age-speciﬁc prevalence
of COPD rose signiﬁcantly with increasing age (P < 0.05 for
both men and women; Supplementary Figure 2). It reached
17.0% (95% CI 15.6–18.3) among those aged ≥40 years. COPD
prevalence was higher in rural residents (15.9%, 95% CI 14.9–
16.9) than in urban residents (10.5%, 8.7–12.5; P < 0.001;
Table 2). The prevalence of COPD was 15.7% (95% CI 14.4–17.1)
in primary school or less, 15.7% (95% CI 14.3–17.2) in middle
school or high school, and 11.2% (95% CI 9.3–13.3) in college and
higher. Participants with history of tuberculosis exposure had a
higher prevalence of COPD than those without it (20.7%, 95% CI
15.7–26.3) vs. 14.8%, 95% CI 13.9–15.7); P < 0.02; Table 2).
We also performed a sensitivity analysis using an age-
speciﬁc ﬁxed cut-oﬀto deﬁne COPD. The overall prevalence of
spirometry-deﬁned COPD was 10.6% (95% CI 9.9–11.4). Men
had a higher prevalence (11.8%, 95% CI 10.4–13.3) than women
(10.1%, 95% CI 9.2–11.0; P < 0.05). Supplementary Table 1
presents the severity of COPD by GOLD grades. Approximately
34.5% COPD patients self-reported typical symptoms, such as
frequent cough, sputum, recurrent wheezing, or dyspnea in daily
life (Supplementary Table 2).

Predictors of COPD
Figure 1 displays the adjusted OR and 95% CI from the
multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine the COPD-
associated risk factors. For never-smokers with COPD, the
common independent association was age ≥60 years, exposure
to solid fuel, living in a rural area and a history of tuberculosis.
Characteristics of Participants by Solid
Fuel Exposure
Participants with solid fuel exposure had a higher prevalence of
COPD than those without it (17.1% (95% CI 16.0–18.2) vs. 10.0%
(95% CI 8.7–11.5); P < 0.0001) (Table 2). The age-stratiﬁed
prevalence of COPD was signiﬁcantly higher in participants with
solid fuel exposure than in those without it, and the ﬁxed cut-oﬀ
used did not change this result (Figure 2).
Participants with solid fuel exposure tended to be older,
women, less educated and living in rural areas compared with
those without such exposure (Table 3). On average, participants
with solid fuel exposure had lower pre- and post-bronchodilator
FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC than those without such exposure.
Participants with solid fuel exposure had higher frequencies of
chronic cough, dyspnea in daily life and at least one symptom
when compared with those without such exposure (Figure 3).
Participants with solid fuel exposure were more likely to
have COPD than those without such exposure. The adjusted
OR and 95% CI for the association between solid fuel exposure
and COPD was stronger in women (adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI
1.39–2.21) than in men (1.64, 1.21–2.24) (Table 4).
Participants with solid fuel exposure were more likely to have
chronic cough, dyspnea in daily life and at least one symptom
than those without such exposure (Table 4). Participants with
solid fuel exposure were 72% more likely to have at least one
symptom (cough, sputum, wheeze, dyspnea) than participants
without such exposure (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.47–2.01).
Solid Fuel and Small Airway Dysfunction
The prevalence of small airway dysfunction was higher in
participants with solid fuel exposure than in those without
such exposure (55.7% vs. 47.9%; P < 0.001) (Figure 4). The
sex-stratiﬁed prevalence of COPD was signiﬁcantly higher in
participants with solid fuel exposure than in those without it.
Participants with solid fuel exposure were also more likely to have
small airway dysfunction than those without such exposure (OR
1.35, 95% CI 1.18–1.53) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of COPD and its
risk factors among never-smokers in Xinjiang and Tibet, with a
special focus on solid fuel exposure. Both COPD prevalence and
solid fuel exposure were signiﬁcantly high among never-smokers.
The factors independently associated with COPD were age ≥60
years, exposure to solid fuel, living in a rural area and a history
of tuberculosis. In addition, we found a positive association
between solid fuel exposure and respiratory symptoms or small
airway dysfunction. Our results highlight the substantial burden
of COPD among never-smokers and conﬁrm the increasingly
acknowledged impact of solid fuel on respiratory health.
Based on BOLD and other large scale epidemiological studies,
it is estimated that the global prevalence of COPD is about
11.7%, which increased 68.9% between 1990 and 2010 (22).
Although smoking is the leading cause of COPD in the world,
an estimated 25–45% of patients with COPD have never smoked
(7). Never-smokers with COPD are an important population
that is increasing but remains understudied. The China Kadoorie
Biobank (CKB) study (8) showed that the prevalence of COPD
was 5.9% for women and 5.2% for men, but the prevalence
varies widely by region. The prevalence of COPD in our study
was 15.0% in western China, which is consistent with the CKB
study of COPD prevalence in Sichuan province, which is a
high COPD prevalence that they cannot explain” (8). Sichuan
province borders Tibet to the west, and they both belong to
western China. Our study provides further insight into the
prevalence of COPD in never-smokers populations in western
China. The prevalence of COPD in never-smokers was in line

with the BOLD study (18.2%) (23). Although this rate was higher
than in studies from developed countries, such as the OLIN study
(6.9%) and the CanCOLD study (6.4%), the rates of solid fuel use
and tuberculosis are considerably lower than previously reported
in developing countries (24, 25).
About 3 billion people worldwide use solid fuel for cooking
or heating (7). Despite the decrease in the percentage of people
using solid fuels, the absolute population exposed to solid fuel
is more than three times greater than those smoking daily (12).
Solid fuel causes an estimated 3.5–4 million deaths every year and
more than 90% of solid fuel-related deaths occur in developing
countries, mainly in Asia and Africa (11). International studies
showed that participants with solid fuel exposure were 41% more
likely to have COPD than those without such exposure (26).
In addition, a cohort study revealed that long-term exposure to
solid fuel for cooking was associated with about 10% excess risk
of hospitalization or death due to COPD (27). The relationship
between solid fuel exposure and COPD reported in our study
was positive and the association was stronger than the results of
previous analyses probably because our analysis was conducted
in never-smokers (26) and the proportion of subjects exposed
to solid fuel in our study was higher (70.8%) than that reported
in these previous surveys. Solid fuel use has the potential to
adversely aﬀect the entire population, but the eﬀects of solid fuel

may be more apparent in never-smokers, in whom exposure to
tobacco is not a competing risk factor (28).
The small airways are the major and earliest site of airﬂow
limitation. Pathological studies suggest that loss of small airways
prior to the development of abnormal spirometry or emphysema
in COPD patients (29, 30). Recently, a cross-sectional study
highlights that small airway disease is a pathological feature
in mild and moderate COPD. Previous studies suggested that
biomass smoke exposed patients demonstrated a distinct proﬁle
of small airways disease when compared to tobacco smoke
exposed patients (31, 32). Our study showed that the prevalence
of small airway dysfunction is higher in participants with solid
fuel exposure than in those without it. We also found that
participants with soldi fuel exposure had lower levels of pre- and
post-bronchodilator FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio, reﬂecting
worse lung function among never-smokers. Previous studies
found exposure-response relationships between solid fuel and
lung function (33, 34). Individuals exposed to solid fuel had a
higher prevalence of small airway dysfunction and lower lung
function, suggesting that chronic inﬂammation from solid fuel

Solid Fuel and COPD in Never-Smokers
exposure is associated with the development of chronic airway
disease. Although the pathogenic mechanisms behind the harm
caused by solid fuel are not yet fully understood, solid fuel
is considered to enhance lung inﬂammation, alter the innate
immune response and promote an oxidative stress state (35).
Our study emphasizes the importance of solid fuel reduction
strategies, as public health intervention, which can reduce the
burden of COPD. Previous studies showed that the adoption
of clean fuel may be beneﬁcial for preventing COPD (36).
Meanwhile, the elevated risks associated with historical solid fuel
use may still be attenuated by switching to clean fuels later in
life (27, 36). A retrospective cohort study reported signiﬁcantly
lower risks of COPD in lifelong coal users who adopted a
ventilated stove for cooking than in those who did not (37). This
should encourage greater eﬀorts to facilitate universal access to
clean energy, as promoted by the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal (38).
Previous
pulmonary
tuberculosis
was
reported
to
be
associated with airway ﬁbrosis, and may lead to lung scarring
and airway damage (7, 39). The BOLD and PLATINO studies
revealed stronger associations between self-reported history
of tuberculosis and COPD in people who had never smoked
(6, 39). Similarly, in our study, the history of tuberculosis
was closely related to the diagnosis of COPD among never-
smokers.
Therefore,
eﬀective
measures
for
preventing
tuberculosis are important in the prevention of COPD in
this population.
Living in a rural area and increasing age were associated
with a higher rate of COPD in our study, which is consistent
with previous ﬁndings. For example, rural residence was
previously reported to be an independent risk factor for COPD
among never-smokers (28). The association between COPD
and older age among never-smokers could be attributable to
the accumulative eﬀects of risk factors over time and the
age-related weakening of respiratory muscles that leads to
decreased FEV1/FVC, as determined by standardized spirometry
tests (40).
There are some limitations to our study. First, these data
were cross-sectional and we are unable to draw ﬁrm conclusions
in terms of causation and measure other potential risk factors.
Second, some analyses were limited by the design of the
questionnaire, which was intended to be comprehensive and easy
to administer, but in some cases prevented optimal detailed data
collection. We were unable to quantify direct exposure to solid
fuel beyond self-reported questionnaires. Third, with a male-
to-female ratio of 1 to 2 in our study sample, one may argue
that the results could not be generalizable to men. However,
in the gender-speciﬁc analysis (with 2,000 men), we found no
evidence of heterogeneity. Fourth, the diagnosis of small airway
dysfunction in this study was entirely based on spirometry, which
could be less accurate than pathological examination and imaging
techniques. Finally, those with asthma were not excluded from
the study population, which might cause an over-estimate of
COPD prevalence in younger age groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this study conﬁrmed the substantial burden of
COPD among never-smokers. Our data suggested that, apart
from exposure to solid fuel, history of tuberculosis, living in a
rural area and older age are associated with an increased risk of
COPD among never-smokers. Furthermore, we found a positive
association between solid fuel exposure and COPD or small
airway dysfunction.

"Inﬂammatory responses have an important role in the onset of many lung diseases associated with urban air-
borne particulate matter (PM). Here we investigate eﬀects and mechanisms linked to PM-induced expression and
release of two main interleukins, IL-6 and IL-8, in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. The cells were
exposed to well characterized Milan city PM, winter PM2.5 (wPM2.5) and summer PM10 (sPM10), representing
combustion and non-combustion sources, respectively. Both wPM2.5 and sPM10 increased mRNA-synthesis and
intracellular protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Exposure to sPM10 also resulted in continuous and time-dependent
increases in release of IL-6 and IL-8 for up to 48 h. By comparison, in wPM2.5-exposed cells IL-8 release was not
signiﬁcantly augmented, while extracellular IL-6 levels were increased but remained constant beyond 24 h ex-
posure. Moreover, wPM2.5 also reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-increased release of IL-8. No cytotoxicity
or signiﬁcant adsorption of cytokines to wPM2.5 were observed. Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed an
accumulation of IL-8 in intracellular vesicles and alterations in actin ﬁlament organization in wPM2.5 exposed
cells, suggesting that the traﬃcking of vesicles carrying interleukins to the plasma membrane might be inhibited.
Thus, wPM2.5 appeared to impair cytokine release in BEAS-2B cells, in particular of IL-8, possibly by damaging
cytoskeletal function involved in protein secretion.

"Fly ash from municipal waste incineration contains large amounts of hazardous trace elements. In this study, the 
total contents and chemical forms of 13 hazardous trace elements (Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba, Co 
and Sb) in MSWI fly ash during one week were analyzed in order to reveal their environmental leaching risk and 
migration capacity. The contents of the different trace elements varied greatly, with the lowest amount, only 
3.75 μg/g, recorded for Se and the highest amount of up to 2009.43 μg/g for Zn. The effective fractions of all 
elements exceeded 20%, and the effective fraction of Cd was as high as 97.16%. The risk of each trace element in 
MSWI fly ash was evaluated using the RAC method and Nemerow Pollution Index method. The RAC evaluation 
showed that all trace elements pose at least a low risk to the environment. The Nemerow Pollution Index analysis 
indicated that the risk of Cd and Sb is extremely high and results in a “Seriously polluted” risk level for the 
combined fly ash contamination. Therefore, suitable measures should be taken to avoid harm to the surrounding 
environment before MSWI fly ash is discharged.

": Southeast Asia (SEA) is a hotspot region for atmospheric pollution and haze conditions, due
to extensive forest, agricultural and peat ﬁres. This study aims to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations
across Malaysia using machine-learning (ML) models like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector
Regression (SVR), based on satellite AOD (aerosol optical depth) observations, ground measured air
pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and meteorological parameters (air temperature, relative humidity,
wind speed and direction). The estimated PM2.5 concentrations for a two-year period (2018–2019)
are evaluated against measurements performed at 65 air-quality monitoring stations located at
urban, industrial, suburban and rural sites. PM2.5 concentrations varied widely between the stations,
with higher values (mean of 24.2 ± 21.6 µg m−3) at urban/industrial stations and lower (mean
of 21.3 ± 18.4 µg m−3) at suburban/rural sites. Furthermore, pronounced seasonal variability
in PM2.5 is recorded across Malaysia, with highest concentrations during the dry season (June–
September). Seven models were developed for PM2.5 predictions, i.e., separately for urban/industrial
and suburban/rural sites, for the four dominant seasons (dry, wet and two inter-monsoon), and an
overall model, which displayed accuracies in the order of R2 = 0.46–0.76. The validation analysis
reveals that the RF model (R2 = 0.53–0.76) exhibits slightly better performance than SVR, except for
the overall model. This is the ﬁrst study conducted in Malaysia for PM2.5 estimations at a national
scale combining satellite aerosol retrievals with ground-based pollutants, meteorological factors
and ML techniques. The satisfactory prediction of PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia allows a
continuous monitoring of the pollution levels at remote areas with absence of measurement networks.

"Air pollution assessment in urban and rural areas is really challenging due to high spatio-temporal variability of 
aerosols and pollutants and the uncertainties in measurements and modelling estimates. Nevertheless, accurate 
determination of the pollution sources and distribution of PM2.5 concentrations is especially important for source 
apportionment and mitigation strategies. This study provides estimates of PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia 
in high spatial resolution, based on multi-satellite data and machine learning (ML) models, namely Random 
Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), also covering remote 
areas without measurement networks. The study aims to develop ML models that are simpler than previous 
works and demonstrate computational efficiency. Six sub-models were developed to represent different locations 
and seasons in Malaysia. Model 1 includes all data from 65 air-quality stations, Models 2 and 3 characterize 
urban/industrial and suburban sites, respectively, while Models 4 to 6 correspond to dry, wet, and inter-monsoon 
seasons, respectively. The RF technique exhibited slightly better performance compared to the XGBoost and SVR 
approaches. More specifically, for model 1, it exhibited a high correlation with a coefficient of determination (R2) 
of 0.64 and RMSE of 12.17 μg m−3, while similar results were obtained for models 3, model 4 and model 5. The 
lower performance (R2 = 0.16–0.94) observed in the wet and inter-monsoon seasons is due to fewer number of 
data used in model calibration. Integration of two AOD products from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and 
Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors together with gases pollutants from Sentinel 5P 
enabled seamless seasonal PM2.5 mapping over Malaysia, even for a short period of time. However, usage of data 
with insufficient information during the model training procedure, and lack of satellite data due to cloud 
contamination, can limit the PM2.5 prediction accuracy.

"This study focuses on the alarming levels of black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter ­(PM2.5) pollution during winter 
in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study period was chosen to coincide with the cold wave period during winter when temperatures 
were at their lowest. The average concentration of BC (24.2 µgm−3) and ­PM2.5 (73.2 µgm−3) in Dhaka, the capital city, were 
measured and found to surpass national air quality standards and WHO guidelines. The study period had two distinct parts: 
a high pollution (HP) period from January 23–25, 2024, and a low pollution (LP) period from January 12–15, 2024. During 
the HP period, the average BC and ­PM2.5 concentrations were 60 and 36% higher than the overall study period average. On 
the other hand, during the LP period, the average BC and ­PM2.5 concentrations declined by about 30 and 26%, respectively, 
compared to the overall study period averages. High concentrations of BC (> 10 µgm−3) were detected daily, indicating 
significant pollution levels during the winter season. Distinct diurnal patterns were observed during the HP period. Specifi-
cally, the concentration of BC significantly increased during the night, in contrast to the mild diurnal patterns observed in 
the LP period. Moreover, both ­PM2.5 and BC concentrations exhibited a statistically significant negative correlation with 
key meteorological parameters, including wind speed, wind direction, and visibility. This study highlights the critical role 
of meteorological factors in managing air pollution, which has broader implications for environmental sustainability.

Abstract
Background: Although the association between exposure to particulate matter and health is well
established, there remains uncertainty as to whether certain chemical components are more
harmful than others. We explored whether the association between cause-specific hospital
admissions and PM2.5 was modified by PM2.5 chemical composition.
Methods: We estimated the association between daily PM2.5 and emergency hospital admissions
for cardiac causes (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory
disease, and diabetes in 26 US communities, for the years 2000-2003. Using meta-regression, we
examined how this association was modified by season- and community-specific PM2.5 composition,
controlling for seasonal temperature as a surrogate for ventilation.
Results: For a 10 μg/m3 increase in 2-day averaged PM2.5 concentration we found an increase of
1.89% (95% CI: 1.34- 2.45) in CVD, 2.25% (95% CI: 1.10- 3.42) in MI, 1.85% (95% CI: 1.19- 2.51) in
CHF, 2.74% (95% CI: 1.30- 4.2) in diabetes, and 2.07% (95% CI: 1.20- 2.95) in respiratory
admissions. The association between PM2.5 and CVD admissions was significantly modified when
the mass was high in Br, Cr, Ni, and Na+, while mass high in As, Cr, Mn, OC, Ni, and Na+ modified
MI, and mass high in As, OC, and SO42- modified diabetes admissions. For these species, an
interquartile range increase in their relative proportion was associated with a 1-2% additional
increase in daily admissions per 10 μg/m3 increase in mass.
Conclusions: We found that PM2.5 mass higher in Ni, As, and Cr, as well as Br and OC significantly
increased its effect on hospital admissions. This result suggests that particles from industrial
combustion sources and traffic may, on average, have greater toxicity.
Background
Many studies have shown that ambient particulate air pol-
lution (PM), generally measured as particles with aerody-
namic diameter less then 10 micrometers (PM10), is
associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for
broadly defined cardiovascular or respiratory causes [1-6].

Similar relationships have been reported in locations
reflecting a wide range of particle composition, and con-
centrations of gaseous co-pollutants [7-11].
Diabetics are more susceptible to particles and previous
panel studies and time series analyses have shown this
[12-14].
While previous studies have primarily used ambient PM10
as an exposure metric, PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic
diameter less then 2.5 micrometers) have become a
greater health and regulatory concern due to epidemio-
logic studies suggesting that PM2.5 might have greater tox-
icity than larger particles [15,16].
Nevertheless, as the US Environmental Protection Agency
(US EPA) did not begin monitoring PM2.5 concentrations
until 1999, the literature on the association between
PM2.5 and mortality [16-21] is relatively sparse. There
have been even fewer studies examining the association of
PM2.5 with hospital admissions [22-25].
Fine particles consist of a large number of compounds
and their composition varies spatially and temporally. Its
components can be associated with specific sources, such
as elemental carbon with traffic, nickel with oil burning
and selenium with coal burning power plants. While the
evidence for the health effects of fine particles has been
growing, there is uncertainty as to which components of
these particles are most harmful. Moreover, a better
understanding of the relative toxicity of particles with dif-
fering chemical composition will in turn lead to more tar-
geted emission control strategies and regulations.
One main limitation in examining PM2.5 components is
the irregularity of the PM2.5 speciation data available from
the EPA Speciation Trends Network (STN) monitoring
sites. The STN was established in 2000 and monitors only
report data for every third or sixth day, thus limiting the
statistical power necessary to detect associations between
individual species and health events. The lack of daily
sampling also prevents the examination of time lags and
effect of multi-day exposures.
Consequently, there have been few studies to date exam-
ining the health effects associated with PM2.5 compo-
nents. One study [26] examined the associations between
19 PM2.5 components and daily mortality in six California
counties, and found that PM2.5 mass and several constitu-
ents (EC, OC, NO3-, Fe, K, Ti) were associated especially
with cardiovascular deaths at various lags. Another study
[27] used the elemental composition of PM2.5 to investi-
gate the effect of traffic, residual oil and power plant emis-
sions on daily mortality in six US cities. Their results
indicate that combustion particles in the fine particles
from mobile and coal combustion sources were associ-
ated with increased mortality.
The most recent study [28] examined the differential
effects of PM2.5 species on mortality in 25 U.S. communi-
ties. This study differs from the two previous studies, in
that rather than directly using the observed particle com-
ponent concentrations in their main model, they over-
came the issue of limited statistical power and inability to
examine more than one day exposure due to poor tempo-
ral coverage of data reported from the STN sites by using
a hierarchical approach. The authors first determined the
association between PM2.5 mass and mortality, and then
in a second stage of the analysis, a meta-regression was
used to examine how the pooled association was modi-
fied by community and season particle composition. They
found evidence that Ni (predominantly from oil combus-
tion) as well as Sulfate and As (from coal burning power
plants) increased the mortality risk associated with PM2.5.
In this study we applied the method of Franklin and co-
authors to examine the association between cause-specific
hospital admissions and PM2.5 in 26 U.S. communities,
and explore whether PM2.5 chemical composition played
a role in its toxicity.

obtained online from the EPA Technology Transfer Net-
work Air Quality System [29].
We selected the same cities studied by Franklin et al [30],
but also included Chicago, IL, as we had MEDICARE and
sufficient speciation data between 2000 and 2003. These
cities were originally chosen due to availability of daily
PM2.5 data. For most of these cities, the metropolitan
county encompassed the city and much of its suburbs, but
we used multiple counties for Boston (Suffolk, Norfolk,
and Middlesex), and Minneapolis-St. Paul (Ramsey and
Hennepin). Henceforth we refer to the analyzed geo-
graphical areas as communities.
The STN monitors operate on a 24 hour schedule and col-
lect particles on Teflon, nylon or quartz filters which are
analyzed for trace elements using X-ray fluorescence, for
ions using ion chromatography and for organic and ele-
mental carbon using thermal-optical analysis.
The EPA maintains multiple PM2.5 mass sites, but typically
only one PM2.5 speciation site within a county. In order to
use all the available PM2.5 monitoring sites, the 24-hour
integrated mass concentrations were averaged over the
county using a method previously described [31]. Briefly,
we computed local daily mean concentrations using anEnvironmental Health 2009, 8:58

algorithm that accounts for the different monitor-specific
means and variances. However, before averaging, any
monitor that was not well correlated with the others (r <
0.8 for two or more monitor pairs within a community)
was excluded as it likely measured a local pollution source
and would not represent the general population exposure
over the entire county. The number of monitors across the
counties varied between 1 and 4.
Based on results from previous epidemiological studies
[26-33] we focused on the species with different sources
and toxicological background. In particular we focus on
the paper of Franklin et al [30] who also screened the STN
data for inconsistencies based on the percentage of data
below the minimum detection limit and with quality con-
trol flags. We therefore examined the following species:
Arsenic (As), Aluminium (Al), Bromine (Br), Chromium
(Cr), Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni),
Potassium (K), Silicon (Si), Vanadium (V), Zinc (Zn),
ions nitrate (NO3-), Sulfate (SO42-), ammonium (NH4+),
sodium (Na+), elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon
(OC).
For all available observations we computed the ratio
between each species and PM2.5 mass and then took aver-
ages by season across all years to obtain season- and com-
munity-specific long-term mean seasonal concentration
ratios.
Meteorological data including daily mean temperature
and dew point temperature from the predominant
weather station in each community were acquired from
the National Climatic Data Center [34].
Health Data
We extracted data on emergency hospital admissions from
the Health Care Financing Administration (MEDICARE)
billing records for the years 2000-2003. The MEDICARE
system provides hospital coverage for all US citizens aged
65 and over.
Based on evidence from previous studies we chose to
examine causes of admissions which have been associated
with particulate matter and added diabetes as it is related
to CVD complications. We defined cases as persons
admitted from the emergency room with a primary dis-
charge diagnosis of: myocardial infarction (MI, Interna-
tional Classification of Disease ninth revision (ICD-9):
410), diabetes (ICD-9: 250), congestive heart failure
(CHF, ICD-9:428), cardiac disease (CVD, ICD-9:390-
429), and all respiratory disease (RESP, ICD-9:460-519).
Statistical Methods
We applied a time series analysis using Poisson regression
to examine the association between daily counts of cause-
specific admissions and daily PM2.5 mass concentrations
in each community. In each community, the analysis was
stratified by season, since the composition of particles var-
ies seasonally, due in part to different source contribu-
tions at different times of the year. In each community, we
controlled for season and long term trend with a natural
cubic regression spline with 1.5 degrees of freedom (d.f.)
for each season and year (corresponding to six d.f. per
year); day of the week using indicator variables; and three-
day averaged temperature and dew point temperature
with a natural cubic spline with three d.f..
The effect estimates were expressed as a percent increase in
hospital admission with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5
mass concentration averaged over the day before and the
day of admission.
In the second stage of the analysis, we combined the Pois-
son regression effect estimates using random effects meta-
analysis [35] to obtain an overall effect across all the com-
munities. The season and community specific long-term
mean seasonal concentration ratios, which reflect particle
composition and thus the relative contribution of differ-
ent sources to the PM2.5 mass, were then used in a meta-
regression to quantify to what extent the association
between PM2.5 mass and admissions was modified by par-
ticle composition. This involved regressing the commu-
nity and season-specific Poisson estimates (four for each
community for a total of 104 coefficients) against the
community and season-specific mean concentration
ratios; we first included one element at the time and then
we included those species that were significant effect mod-
ifiers in that first stage in a multivariate model. In the
meta-regression, the variance was composed of the sum of
estimated variance from the first stage, and a random var-
iance-covariance matrix component reflecting heteroge-
neity over and above what can be explained by the
modifier variables, as previously described by Franklin et
al [28] and Zanobetti et al [36].
Franklin et al [30] also found that the association between
PM2.5 mass and mortality was modified by the seasonal
average temperature and used it as a surrogate to explain
ventilation of ambient air to the indoor environment
[37]. They showed an inverted U-shape relationship with
the PM2.5 - mortality effect estimates and temperature
indicating that at extremes of temperature, when windows
and doors are closed resulting in reduced ventilation, the
effect of ambient PM2.5 on mortality was smaller than at
moderate temperatures. We assumed that this phenome-
non held true for hospital admissions and thus the meta-
regression for each outcome included a linear and quad-
ratic term to control for mean temperature.
We used the I2 statistic to assess the proportion of total
variation in effect estimates that was due to between-com-
munity heterogeneity [38]. The I2 statistic, I2 = [Q/(k - 1)]Environmental Health 2009, 8:58
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/8/1/58
Page 4 of 12
(page number not for citation purposes)
- 1/[Q/(k - 1)] where k is the number of communities, is a
generalization of the Χ2 or Q test for heterogeneity and
expresses the proportion of variance explained. When Q/
(k - 1) is below 1 there is no heterogeneous variability in
the estimates.
Finally, as there is evidence that socioeconomic status
(SES) plays a role in the health effects of particles (Finkel-
stein 2003; Levy 2000), we examined community-specific
parameters including: median household income, percent
of population below poverty line, percent of adult popu-
lation having graduated high school, and percent of all
households having the head of the household 65 years of
age or older and below poverty level in 1999, obtained
from the US Census Bureau [39]. The community-specific
prevalence of central air conditioning (AC), obtained
from the American Housing Survey [40], was also exam-
ined to address the potential for any residual heterogene-
ity associated with ventilation/particle penetration not
sufficiently accounted for with the quadratic term for sea-
sonally averaged temperature. Each parameter was
included separately in the meta-regression along with
temperature and each species proportion. Although SES
parameters and central AC prevalence did not vary season-
ally, both were included in the seasonal meta-regression.
We used SAS 9.1 [41] for data management, and R 2.7.2
[42] for regression modelling.
Results
Table 1 shows the mean number and standard deviation
of daily hospital admissions in each community by cause,
together with the distribution of the 2-day moving aver-
age of PM2.5. Over all 26 communities we examined
685,716 CVD, 121,652 MI, 238,587 CHF, 46,192 diabe-
tes, and 261,449 respiratory related admissions.
When looking across all seasons (Table 1), El Paso, TX,
Minneapolis, MN, and Seattle, WA, had the lowest PM2.5
concentrations, while Riverside, Bakersfield, and Los
Angeles, CA had the highest concentrations. The lowest
mean concentration of PM2.5 mass, when looking by sea-
son (not shown), was observed in Sacramento in spring
(6.1 μg/m3), well below the National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) of 15 μg/m3, while the highest spring-
time concentration was in Riverside (24 μg/m3). The high-

est winter values were observed in Bakersfield and Fresno,
CA, which were 29.5 and 29.9 μg/m3, respectively.
Species to PM2.5 mass proportions averaged over all com-
munities are presented in Table 2, while community and
season-specific proportions of six selected species are
illustrated in Figure 1. Notably, organic carbon was higher
in all Californian communities in all seasons compared to
other communities; while Ni was higher in Sacramento,
Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Boston in winter and in
Harrisburg and Fresno in spring.
The meta-analysis results are shown in Table 3. Across all
the seasons, for a 10 μg/m3 increase in two-day averaged
PM2.5 concentration we found a 1.89% increase (95% CI:
1.34-2.45) in CVD admissions, a 2.25% increase (95% CI:
1.10-3.42) in MI admissions, a 1.85% increase (95% CI:
1.19-2.51) in CHF admissions, a 2.74% increase (95% CI:
1.30-4.2) in diabetes admissions, and a 2.07% increase
(95% CI: 1.20-2.95) in respiratory admissions. Season-
ally, the percent increase in each cause of admission was
found to be highest in the spring, while it was generally

lower in summer and autumn, except for diabetes which
was high in autumn as well.
We found significant though moderate heterogeneity
among the community-specific effect estimates across all
seasons (I2-statistic p < 0.05) for CVD and MI admissions,
where 33% (CVD) and 24% (MI) of the total variability,
as reported by the I2 statistic, was attributable to between-
community differences (as opposed to stochastic varia-
tion). For CHF, diabetes and respiratory admissions no
significant heterogeneity among the community-specific
effect estimates was found. We report the effect modifica-
tion for all the causes analyzed even though cardiac effects
were the only ones that displayed significant heterogene-
ity.
As we also found a similar inverted U-shaped association
as shown in Franklin [28] between the effect estimates
and season and city mean temperature, we adjusted for
temperature with both a linear and square term in the
meta-regression. Results of effect modification by species-
to-mass proportions, adjusted for temperature, are shown
in Table 4. For each species and cause of admission we
present the P-value for the effect modification, and the
percent increase for an IQR increase in the proportions
with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We only show the
results with a P-value < 0.07.
We found that some species, Fe, NH4+, NO3-, Si, Zn, EC,
and Pb did not result in any effect modification of the
association between PM2.5 and hospital admissions.

Although single species are markers for more complex
particle chemistry, for clarity of presentation we divided
the species in the following groups to represent the gen-
eral categories for which these elements are markers.
Industrial combustion sources: Ni, V, As, Cr, SO42-; Soil
and road dust: Al; Traffic: Br, OC, EC; Sea salt, street salt:
Na+; Soil and industrial sources: Mn; Wood burning and
soil: K.
The association between mass and CVD admissions was
significantly (p = 0.05) modified by Br, Ni, Na+, V and Al.
Specifically, an IQR increase in the proportion of bromine
in PM2.5 mass was associated with an additional 0.81%
increase in CVD admissions (95% CI: 0.2-1.4). Similarly
there was an additional 0.7% (95% CI: 0.01-1.44)
increase for an IQR increase in V, a 0.9% increase (95%
CI: 0.5-1.4) for an interquartile increase in Ni, and a
0.87% increase (95% CI: 0.4-1.4) for an IQR increase in
Na+ (Table 4). The association between PM2.5 and MI was
modified by As, Cr, Mn, OC, Ni, K, and Na+.
Including a combination of species proportions that were
statistically significant in Table 4 and performing a back-
ward elimination, in multi-species models we found that
for CVD the combination of Br and Ni remained statisti-
cally significant (P <= 0.05), with an additional 0.57%
increase in CVD for an IQR increase in Br and an addi-
tional 0.80% increase for an IQR increase in Ni. When we
examined MI, only Ni remained significant.

In a sensitivity analysis, changing the weather specifica-
tion in the first stage to linear showed the same results as
using cubic regression splines.
Central air conditioning (AC) and the SES variables were
not statistically significant in the meta-regression and thus
did not explain any residual heterogeneity in the effect
estimates over and above what temperature and the spe-
cies could explain. Moreover, the magnitude of the modi-
fication by the species proportions did not change
drastically with the inclusion of AC or the SES parameters;
they were only slightly increased or reduced.
Because Na+ and Ni were associated with both CVD and
MI admissions, we examined their concentrations more
carefully and found that levels were consistently higher in
California. For Na+, this may be attributable to the contri-
bution of marine aerosol from the Pacific Ocean. To sup-
port this we present the relationship between Na+
concentrations and wind direction for the Los Angeles
site. As shown by the wind rose (Figure 2), higher levels
were observed when air masses passed over the sea (com-
ing from SW). As a comparison, a similar wind rose was
examined for EC, typically associated with local traffic
(Figure 2), but no wind pattern was observed. Interest-
ingly, the wind roses for Ni and V were similar to Na+, sug-
gesting that wind coming over the ocean also carries
elements often associated with ship emissions (not
shown).
Discussion
In this multi-community study we found a significant
association between PM2.5 mass and both respiratory and
cardiac hospital admissions. These effects were strongest
in spring and were significantly modified by certain chem-
ical components of the mass. The rationale for using spe-
cies-to-mass concentration ratios in the second stage was
that in the first stage the admission risk was estimated per
unit of the total PM2.5 mass, which encompasses all meas-
ured species, and therefore effect modification by the spe-
cies was best expressed on a per unit of PM2.5 mass basis.
One study [24] reported associations between hospital
admissions and PM2.5, but the authors examined different
categories of admissions than us, except for heart failure.
They reported an association of 1.28% (95% CI, 0.78%-
1.78%) increase in risk of heart failure per 10 μg/m3
increase in same-day PM2.5, which is comparable to our
estimate of 1.85% (95% CI: 1.19-2.51) increase in CHF
for the same and previous day average of PM2.5. Similar
results have been found by Peng [43], Metzger [44], and
by Halonen [45]. Bell and co-authors [23] found higher
effects in winter; they used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchi-
cal model which included two interaction terms allowing
both the exposure and the temporal trend to differ by sea-
son. Instead we stratified by season, allowing a more spe-
cific control for season and trend within each community.
Another difference is that the authors included cities with
systematically missing data, which may have several
implications in modelling the time series.
Two recent studies [22] examined the toxicity of PM2.5
chemical composition on hospital admissions. Bell et al
[22] used the method we introduced in Franklin 2008 and
used here; in the second stage however, they didn't take
into account indoor infiltration. We had previously dem-
onstrated [28] that mean seasonal temperature was an
important predictor of the effect of PM2.5 in that city and
season, and since species concentrations can vary with
temperature, an important confounder of assessing the
role of species. We controlled for this in the analyses in
this paper. Bell examined a larger number of communities
and utilized same-day (lag 0) PM2.5 concentrations versus
the mean of lags 0 and 1 in our study. They found associ-
ations with Ni, EC and V while we did not see any effects
for EC. Peng et al [46] used time-series analysis of the
measured (one in three or one in six day) PM2.5 species,
and found significant effects at lag 0 for EC, OC and
ammonium, but not for Ni. Some of these differences may
be due to confounding by ventilation patterns.
Our findings have several important parallels with Frank-
lin and co-authors [28]. For instance, across all admission
types, we found that the elements emitted primarily
through industrial combustion, namely Ni and As, dis-
played the greatest and most consistent effect modifica-
tion. We also found moderate modification by Al, which
was shown to be a strong modifier in the previous study.
The primary differences were that we found that Br and
OC, species often associated with traffic, and Na+, an ion
often associated with marine aerosol, were effect modifi-
ers of several causes of admissions.
We also found a significant effect of PM2.5 on admissions
for diabetes, which, despite the smaller daily counts,
shows the strongest association in all season, spring, and
autumn. As previous studies reported, diabetics might be
particularly susceptible to particles [12-14]. We found that
that SO42- and As were significant effect modifiers, associ-
ated with higher rates of diabetes admissions, whereas OC
was associated with lower rates. This finding are consist-
ent with that of O'Neill et al [13], who reported that SO42-
and particles were associated with impaired flow medi-
ated dilation in diabetic subjects and suggests a continu-
ing concern for coal-derived particles.
As we found that only cardiac effects displayed significant
heterogeneity in the PM2.5-admission effect estimates, we
focus our discussion on CVD and MI.Environmental Health 2009, 8:58

Cardiac diseases
We found that the association between PM2.5 and CVD
was modified by species related to traffic (Br), ship emis-
sions (Ni and V), marine or street salt (Na+), and soil and
road dust (Al).
General population exposure to Ni is likely from smelters
and oil combustion including domestic heating and ship
emissions as it is a constituent of Residual Oil Fly Ash
(ROFA). Toxicological studies of ROFA have suggested
that its ability to produce cell and tissue injury as well as
stimulate inflammatory response is due to its high transi-
tion metal content. Gao et al [47] found that ROFA Ni
content played a very important role in mediating an
inflammatory response in human lung cells and that it
produced significantly greater effects in comparison to
other particle types. ROFA has been associated with
increased oxidative stress [48], increased susceptibility to
bacterial infections [49,50], and altered heart rate, blood
pressure, and electrocardiograms [51].
Lippmann [33] exposed atherosclerotic prone mice to
concentrated air particles over a six month period. During
periods when Ni was especially high, there was a pro-
nounced acute change in heart rate and heart rate variabil-
ity in those animals. The authors also examined
associations between PM components and mortality in
the National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study
(NMMAPS), and found that daily mortality rates in the 60
cities with recent speciation data were significantly associ-
ated with average Ni and V, but not with other measured
species.
Franklin and coworkers [28] reported that the effect of PM
mass on daily deaths was higher in communities and sea-
sons with particles higher in Ni content, providing addi-
tional support for our findings.
Not much literature exists on the effects of particles rich in
Br, Cr, Mn, As and Na+. Metzger [44] found that CVD vis-
its in Atlanta were associated with NO2, CO, PM2.5, OC,
EC, and oxygenated hydrocarbons, whereas we did not see
effect modification by EC or OC in this analysis. EC and
OC are often highly correlated with PM2.5 mass, making it
difficult to distinguish an EC or OC effect from a mass
effect.
When looking at mortality outcomes, in a time series
analysis in six California counties, Ostro and co-authors
[26] found that PM2.5 mass and several constituents, OC,
NO3-, Fe, K, and Ti were associated with cardiovascular
deaths.
Franklin et al [28] found that Al was a strong modifier of
the PM2.5-mortality effect, yet in this study it only had a
moderate modification effect for CVD and CHF. Their
results were presented for non-accidental mortality and
were not specific to cardiovascular causes. Nevertheless,
plausible biological mechanisms of an inflammatory
response have been found. Soil and road dust containing
Al and Si have been linked with cardio-pulmonary
responses in canines [52] and Becker [53] found that a fac-
tor containing particle Al was significantly related to an
inflammatory response in human epithelial cells.
Myocardial infarctions
We found that species related to traffic (OC) and several
industrial combustion sources (Ni, As, Cr) were modifiers
leading to increased MI admissions. As noted above, As is
a good marker for coal combustion.
Several studies have examined particle components and
MI. Two studies found support for the hypothesis that
exposure to traffic-related air pollution increases the risk
of acute MI [54,55]. Similarly, a study on repolarization
changes and variations in markers of inflammation in
association with ambient PM in a panel of male coronary
artery disease patients, found that traffic-related and com-
bustion-generated particles had stronger adverse health
impact with regard to cardiac effects, and that particles
from different sources induce an acute phase response in
these patients [56].
Limitations
As noted above a key limitation of this study, and all oth-
ers using the US EPA's speciation network, is the ability for

one monitor to adequately represent concentrations of
species which are more highly spatially variable. For
instance, Ito et al [57] found that correlations between
concentrations of As, EC and Ni were moderate to low
between closely located STN monitors in the New York
City area. Thus, in general, for spatially variable species, a
greater amount of measurement error could be present
when using a single monitor to represent exposure over an
entire community. Therefore some components will suf-
fer from greater measurement error due to greater spatial
variability. Similarly, while in most locations PM2.5 is
quite homogeneous over the spatial scale of a community
this is not true everywhere. For example, while in Phila-
delphia the spatial variability in PM2.5 is small [58], there
can be large variations in PM2.5 concentrations in Los
Angeles [59]. Another limitation of this study is the use of
diabetes admissions which are more problematic to inter-
pret because these are usually related to complications of
the disease, or other cardiovascular complications.
While the use of seasonal ratios of elements to PM2.5 as
modifiers of the effect of mass on mortality allows us to
gain power by using the daily PM2.5 mass concentrations,
it has some limitations. First, while some of the variation
in the ratios is across cities, and some across seasons
within cities, other variation is across days within season,
and this source of variation is not captured. We believe
this day to day variation around the mean for the season
and city is mostly Berkson error with respect to predicting
a city and season specific PM2.5 slope, and hence reduces
power more than inducing bias. Second, because the var-
iation in the ratios includes variations across cities, there
is the possibility of cross-sectional confounding. In con-
trast to cohort studies, where the outcome is death, and
the confounders are other predictors of mortality, our
meta-regression is different. The outcome is PM2.5 slope,
and hence factors that are predictive of mortality (socio-
economic status, diet, etc) that vary across location are
unlikely to be confounders. The confounders will be other
things besides elemental composition that might predict
differences in PM2.5 slopes. We believe the most impor-
tant one is infiltration rates, and have used mean temper-
ature by season and city as a surrogate for that. Obviously,
it is not a perfect one. Other potential confounders might
be differences in individual susceptibility. However,
because we have variation within city across season, we
believe this approach problem is partially mitigated.
Conclusions
Our study shows that some chemical species significantly
modify the association between PM2.5 and cause-specific
hospital admissions. This important finding illustrates
that mass alone is not a sufficient metric to use when eval-
uating health effects of PM exposure.
One recommendation for decision-makers is that daily
speciation data is needed. It is difficult to analyze the
effect of the PM2.5 mass composition with the data availa-
ble only one day in three or six. Furthermore, future
research aimed to address the issue of the effects of the ele-
ments on, for example, cardiovascular endpoints, could
focus more on study such as chamber or panel study, and
toxicological animal study.
More work is needed in order to better understand the
biological mechanisms of PM components, and to better
direct regulation of particles and sources producing pollu-
tion high in these chemical species.

"This work presents a new porous material (SUNSPACE) designed for air particulate matter (PM) capture.
It was developed in answer to the European Commission request of an innovative, affordable, and
sustainable solution, based on design-driven material, to reduce the concentration of air particulate
matter in urban areas. SUNSPACE material was developed from by-products and low-cost materials, such
as silica fume and sodium alginate. Its capability to catch ultraﬁne PM was evaluated by different ad-hoc
tests, considering diesel exhaust fumes and incense smoke PM.
Despite the fact that procedures and materials can be designed for remediation, the high impact on the
environment, for example in terms of natural resources consumption and emissions, are not usually
considered. Instead, we believe that the technologies must be always evaluated in terms of material
embodied energy (EE) and carbon footprint (CF). We deﬁne our approach to solve environment problems
by a sustainable methodology “Azure Chemistry”. For the SUNSPACE synthesis, the multi-criteria deci-
sion analysis was performed to select the best sustainable solution. The emissions and the energies
involved in the synthesis of SUNSPACE material were evaluated with the Azure Chemistry approach,
showing that this could be the best available technology to face the problem of capturing the PM in
urban area.

"Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture
of particles that changes over time and from place to
place; however, most PM is caused by the fuel combus-
tion of motor vehicles and industry. PM is associated
with acute and chronic illnesses, such as pulmonary and
cardiovascular diseases. Medellín is one of the most
polluted cities in Latin America. Therefore, the physi-
cochemical characterization of its PM is necessary to
understand its composition and effect on human health.
In this study, PM was characterized by scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spec-
troscopy (EDS) analysis, Fourier infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), inductivity-coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES), and thermogravimetric analy-
sis (TGA) in order to evaluate its morphology and
chemical composition. The SEM of the PM exhibited
primary particles and agglomerates. The size of the
particles ranged between 0.056 and 4.5 μm. The EDS
revealed elements such as carbon, silicon, calcium, lead,
and iron. Furthermore, carbon monoxide, carbon diox-
ide, and carbonyl and aliphatic functional groups were
observed by means of FTIR. Additionally, weight losses
associated with volatile matter and elemental carbon
were identified in the TGA analysis. The TGA and
FTIR confirmed the presence of fuel and lubricant
traces. Subsequently, lead was selected among the most
common components in the PM in order to conduct an
in silico study into its effect on ventricular activity. Lead
showed a pro-arrhythmic effect by shortening the dura-
tion of the action potential under normal electrophysio-
logical conditions, which could be associated with car-
diovascular diseases.

daily ­PM10 and PAHs concentrations in the both sites 
were 133 μg ­m−3 and 23.8 ng ­m−3 in the pre-monsoon 
period and 49.6 μg ­m−3 and 2.30 ng ­m−3 in the mon-
soon period, respectively. The average daily hopane 
concentration during the pre-monsoon period was 
1.40 ng ­m−3 in Tulsipur and 0.70 ng ­m−3 in Charikot. 
The IndP / (IndP + BghiP) ratio was higher than 0.5 
during monsoon period, indicating combustion of 
biomass and charcoal burning. IndP / (IndP + BghiP) 
between 0.2 and 0.5 during pre-monsoon season indi-
cates petroleum combustion. Fla / (Fla + Pyr) ratio 
between 0.3 and 0.5 during pre-monsoon and mon-
soon periods indicates high proportion of petroleum 
product combustion. The biomass burning associated 
with dense traffic in the center of the two cities was 
the main source of PAHs. The average daily element 
concentration was 6.80 ng ­m−3 in both locations dur-
ing the monsoon period.

Abstract  Concentration of PAHs, hopanes, and 
elements in ­PM10 aerosol samples was measured 
in two Nepalese urban centers, Tulsipur (725  m 
above sea level; 150,000 inhabitants) and Charikot 
(1,550 m above sea level; 23,000 inhabitants) in the 
monsoon period (August 2018) and pre-monsoon 
period (April–May 2019). The 24-h ­PM10 limit value 
of 50  µg  ­m−3 for human health was significantly 
exceeded at all locations, and the Nepal concentra-
tion limit of 150 µg ­m−3 was exceeded at Tulsipur-
bus station, Tulsipur-village, and Charikot-hospital 
in the pre-monsoon season. The average daily ­PM10 
and PAHs concentrations showed seasonal variations, 
with lower concentrations in the monsoon season and 
the higher values in pre-monsoon season. The average

environmental impacts such as deterioration of air 
quality, global climate change, visibility reduction, 
and smog production (Mikuška et al., 2020; Seinfeld 
& Pandis, 1998). Various studies have shown a link 
between increased PM concentration and adverse 
health effects including allergy, asthma, cardiovas-
cular and respiratory diseases, cancer, and increased 
mortality (Brunekreef & Holgate, 2002; Kim et  al., 
2015). The health effects of atmospheric aerosols 
depend mainly on the particle size, the chemical com-
position of particles, and solubility of PM compo-
nents in lung fluid. The size of the particle determines 
how long the particle remains in the atmosphere and 
where it subsequently settles in the human airways. 
­PM10 particles (i.e., particles with aerodynamic 
diameter of 10 µm or less) deposit in upper part of 
respiratory tract while smaller particles such as ­PM2.5 
and ­PM1 particles, due to their small sizes, are able 
to penetrate deep into the lungs (Biswas et al., 2020; 
International Commission on Radiological Protec-
tion, 1994).
PM10 aerosol originates from different emission 
sources such as combustion of coal, biomass, gaso-
line, oil, or diesel fuel. ­PM10 also includes dust from 
agriculture, wildfires, industrial sources, construction 
sites, resuspended dust from road and soil, and pollen.
The chemical composition of ­PM10 is very com-
plex consisting, in general, from carbonaceous spe-
cies, soot, inorganic ions, and elements in variable 
amounts, depending on their location and emission 
sources (Seinfeld & Pandis, 1998). Despite the huge 
number of chemical compounds contained in PM, 
only a limited number of them is considered hazard-
ous to human health. These potentially harmfull com-
pounds include mostly polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs) and some elements (Cd, Pb, Ni, As, Tl, 
Hg, etc.) because of their carcinogenic and mutagenic 
properties (Schroeder et al., 1984; Masiol et al., 2012; 
Křůmal & Mikuška, 2020; Cigánková et al., 2021a). 
PAHs are formed largely during the incomplete com-
bustion of organic material at high temperatures 
(Křůmal et  al., 2013), while elements are emitted 
from variety of emission sources including mainly 
coal and biomass combustion, traffic, and industry 
(Mikuška et al., 2020).
PAHs and elements bound to PM may exert an 
adverse toxic effect only after particle deposition on 
the lung surface, when the soluble particulate compo-
nents may be dissolved into the pulmonary surfactant. 
It is assumed that the soluble fraction of PM compo-
nents is more relevant to the assessment of human 
health risks than their total concentration (Cigánková 
et al., 2021b).
Nepal is one of the fastest growing countries in 
South Asia (Waldorf, 2018). In the State of Global 
Air Report 2020, Nepal is listed among the top 10 
countries with the highest outdoor ­PM2.5 levels in 
2019 (Global Air, 2020). Therefore, air pollution is 
currently one of Nepal’s biggest problems. This is 
due to the rapid deterioration of the urban environ-
ment, which is mainly due to unplanned urbaniza-
tion, transport development (Majumder et al., 2012), 
and industrialization. Concentrations of aerosol par-
ticles regularly reach levels that have been shown to 
be hazardous to human health (Gurung et al., 2013). 
For example, Kathmandu is one of the most polluted 
cities in Asia due to high concentrations of ­PM2.5 and 
­PM10 (Majumder et al., 2012), which regularly exceed 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-
EPA) (Giri et al., 2008) and World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) (CAI-Asia, 2006; World Health Organi-
zation, 2014) limits. Growing population, increasing 
industry and automobile traffic, heavy deforestation, 
and forest fires accelerate the deterioration of air 
quality.
Air pollution by aerosols, ­NO2, ­O3, etc. can be 
studied using satellite data produced by the spectrom-
eters MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec-
troradiometer), TROPOMI (Filonchyk & Yan, 2018), 
etc. (Filonchyk et al., 2018; Biswas et al., 2020; Tor-
res et  al., 2020). The satellite instruments provide 
information about long-term trends of the evaluation 
and variability of spatial distributions of the total con-
centrations of aerosols and other pollutants on local 
or global scales. Alternatively, the aerosols are moni-
tored using ground based instruments that allow the 
measurement of aerosol concentrations over shorter 
time intervals and, moreover, the measurement of aer-
osols in selected size intervals such as size fractions 
­PM1, ­PM2.5, or ­PM10.
The research on air pollution from ­PM10 (Giri 
et  al., 2008) and PAH (Chen et  al., 2015, 2017) in 
Nepal is focused mainly on the capital Kathmandu, 
including the Kathmandu Valley and the area of 
Himalayan Mountains regions. Emissions and pol-
lutant concentrations (including PM) in Kathmandu 
area were estimated by atmospheric transport, depo-
sition, and chemistry models (Adhikary et al., 2007).

Another measurement study examined PAH concen-
trations in ­PM10 in an urban area in the Kathmandu 
Valley (Kishida et al., 2009). Biomass and fossil fuel 
combustion especially by vehicles were identified as 
the main source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Yu et al., 2008). Other study showed higher PM con-
centrations and lead levels in PM samples near roads 
(Aryal et  al., 2008). The highest ­PM10 concentra-
tions were found near industrial centers (Aryal et al., 
2008). Concentrations of ­PM10 were typically higher 
in pre-monsoon (Aryal et al., 2008; Giri et al., 2008).
However, basic available information on atmos-
pheric ­PM10 and its components such as PAHs and 
elements in the Himalayan Mountains (sources, 
types, emissions, concentrations, and fate) is still 
limited (Chen et al., 2015). Several studies described 
ambient measurements of ­PM10, or air quality model 
results for high-altitude areas (e.g. Nepal Climate 
Observatory Pyramid in the Khumbu Valley (5,079 m 
a.s.l.)) (Decesari et al., 2010; Giri et al., 2004, 2008; 
Majumder et al., 2012). The major ­PM10 components 
have been identified as organics and mineral dust, 
with combustion being an important source (Decesari 
et al., 2010). The measurements show temporal pat-
terns. Most pollutants (e.g., ­PM2.5, ­NO2) were higher 
during the pre-monsoon than during the monsoon 
(Sellegri et  al., 2010). Studies showed a regional 
influence on air quality at high elevations (Bonasoni 
et al., 2010).
A major limitation in research on the effect of par-
ticular matter (PM), PAHs, and elements on human 
health in Nepal is the lack of exposure data (Gurung 
et  al., 2013). PAHs are hazardous to humans when 
inhaled (Gong et  al., 2011). Therefore, PAHs have 
received considerable attention owing to their per-
sistence and toxicity, particularly their carcinogenic 
and/or mutagenic properties (Bhargava et  al., 2004; 
Křůmal & Mikuška, 2020). Ambient monitoring net-
works maintained by government organizations are 
required for these purposes. Such data are still not 
available for the whole of Nepal. Only for PM in the 
Kathmandu Valley did the Nepalese government rou-
tinely measure ­PM10 until 2007 (Gurung et al., 2013). 
However, information on current levels of particulate 
matter, including various size fractions, and other pol-
lutants for all Nepal is needed (Gurung et al., 2013) 
to assess health risks. Such work could include ambi-
ent monitoring of PM concentration with alternative, 
low-cost measurement methods using optical sensors 
(Kumar et al., 2015; McKercher et al., 2017).
Information on air pollution focusing on particu-
late PAHs and heavy elements in Nepal is still lim-
ited. To extend the knowledge, this study shows the 
results of monitoring particulate matter ­(PM10) and 
bound PAHs, hopanes, and elements in two differ-
ent Nepalese Urban centers, Tulsipur in the southern 
part of Nepal in the Teraj area and Charikot in the 
northern Himalayas, which are highly affected by 
air pollution. Simultaneously with the measurement 
of dust particles, continuous data on temperature, 
relative humidity, global radiation, wind speed, and 
wind direction were collected directly at the measure-
ment site. Based on these measurements, an overall 
data analysis was conducted in these areas during the 
monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. In addition, we 
compared ­PM10 concentration measured in parallel 
by the real-time particle monitor Has-Dust Electronic 
Pilot Activity and Alertness Monitor (EPAM) 5000 
and low-cost sensors in the pre-monsoon season for 
the possible future use of the sensors in Nepal.

2.1  Site Description
Tulsipur is the second most populous city in the Nep-
alese district of Dang with more than 150,000 inhab-
itants and occupies a municipal area of 385 ­km2. The 
area of Tulsipur is located at an average altitude of 
725 m above sea level. Charikot (officially Bhimesh-
war) is a smaller town of less than 23,000 inhabitants 
located in the northeastern part of Nepal’s Dolakha 
district. The town is composed of several neighboring 
villages and occupies a total area of 70 ­km2 at an alti-
tude of about 1,550 m above sea level (Fig. 1).
Nepal is characterized by a subtropical climate 
with extensive summer monsoon rains between June 
and early September. The average temperature var-
ies between 12 and 14 °C, with a minimum of about 
0 °C during the pre-season and a maximum of about 
35 °C during the summer season and varies consid-
erably depending on the altitude. Wind speed aver-
ages between 0.4 and 7.5 m ­s−1 and average humidity 
ranges between 50 and 80% depending on the season 
(Sill & Kirkby, 2013).

The monitoring was conducted in two periods. 
The first took place in the late August 2018 dur-
ing the monsoon period finishing and the second in 
April–May 2019 during the pre-monsoon period. 
Measurements were conducted at 5 sites, two of 
which were located in the center of Tulsipur (Tulsipur 
– Bank 28.133° N, 82.298° E, Tulsipur – Bus Station 
28.132°N, 82.292°E), one of which was located in 
Tulsipur–Village (28.084°N, 82.376°E) (Fig.  1) and 
two in the center of Charikot, (Charikot – Hospital

86.048°E) (Fig.  1). Tulsipur has increased urbani-
zation and increased numbers of vehicles in recent 
decades due to increases in the numbers of local resi-
dents. It is also a region with significant rural biomass 
burning. Charikot is located in rural areas of the cen-
tral Himalayas and is characterized by intense local 
anthropogenic activities due to increases in the num-
bers of tourists. In Tulsipur, two polluted locations, 
near the central bus station and central junction, and 
one location on the margin of Tulsipur, near cement 
factory, were selected. In Charikot, two very polluted 
locations in the city center, a central junction and a 
hospital, were used. Monitoring took place from 19 
to 21 August 2018 (monsoon) and from 30 to 4 May 
2019 (pre-monsoon) in Tulsipur and from 26 to 28 
August 2018 (monsoon) and from 10 to 13 May 2019 
(pre-monsoon) in Charikot. The measurements were 
performed for 24  h at each location (Central Euro-
pean Summer Time).

2.2  PM10 Concentration and Meteorological 
Parameter Measurement
Aerosol in the ­PM10 size fraction was measured using 
two Haz-Dust EPAM-5000 monitors (Environmental 
Devices Corporation, USA) equipped with ­PM10 par-
ticle size inlets, and during the pre-monsoon period 
also in parallel with a Cairsens micro-sensor (Envea, 
France) for particulate matters (PM). The monitor 
Haz-Dust EPAM-5000 and the Cairsens sensor were 
placed side by side at a distance of 50 cm. The Haz-
Dust EPAM 5000 is a high-sensitivity, real-time mon-
itoring device for particulate matter and is primarily 
intended for outdoor air quality measurement. This 
device combines traditional aerosol particle trapping 
on filters with real-time tracking methods. Haz-Dust 
EPAM-5000 measures the mass concentration of 
­PM10 aerosol particles in the air with a real-time reso-
lution of 1 min based on light scattering from the par-
ticles. The data is stored in the device’s internal mem-
ory and displayed in real time on the device display. 
The measurement methodology is based on the Euro-
pean Standard for Particulate Measurement in Air 
(Brunekreef & Maynard, 2008). Particles collected 
by the Cairsens microsensor pass through a continu-
ous laser beam in the measuring chamber and scat-
ter light in all directions according to the principle of 
light scattering. This scattered light is analyzed to cal-
culate a mass concentration for the size fraction ­PM10 
(Cairsens, 2020). Uncertainty of Haz-Dust EPAM-
500 monitor is smaller than 3 μg ­m−3. Uncertainty of 
Cairsens micro-sensors is smaller than 5 μg ­m−3.
Temperature and relative humidity of air were 
measured with a Young 4137LC/LF sensor (Young 
Company, Traverse City, Michigan, USA). Wind 
speed and wind direction were measured with a Gill 
2D ultrasonic anemometer (Hampshire, UK), and 
solar radiation intensity was measured with a RS 
81 pyranometer (Envitech Bohemia, Prague, Czech 
Republic).
2.3  Sampling of Aerosols
Atmospheric aerosols in the size fraction ­PM10 
were sampled on quartz fiber (47 mm, QMA, What-
man) and nitrocellulose membrane (47 mm, 1.2 µm 
porosity, Millipore) filters in parallel at a flow rate 
of approximately 4  l/min using two aerosol sam-
plers (Haz-Dust EPAM-5000) for 24  h in August 
2018 (monsoon period) and May 2019 (pre-monsoon 
period). The quartz filters were pre-baked at 500 °C 
for 24 h to remove organic contaminants. Mass con-
centrations of ­PM10 aerosols were determined gravi-
metrically from the difference in filter weights before 
and after sampling using a microbalance (± 1  µg, 
M5P, Sartorius) in a dedicated climate controlled 
weighing room (48 h, air temperature 20 ± 0.1 °C, rel-
ative humidity 50 ± 2%). After weighing, the exposed 
filters were used for chemical analyzes. A total num-
ber of 5 quartz filters in pre-monsoon period (3 in 
Tulsipur, 2 in Charikot), 5 quartz filters in monsoon 
period (3 in Tulsipur, 2 in Charikot), and 5 nitrocel-
lulose filters in monsoon period (3 in Tulsipur, 2 in 
Charikot) were collected.
2.4  Chemical Analysis of Aerosols
2.4.1  Elements
Aerosols collected on nitrocellulose membrane filters 
were analyzed for elemental content. Each filter was 
decomposed in 3 mL of concentrated, sub-boil grade 
nitric acid using a microwave-assisted digestion sys-
tem (UltraWAVE, Milestone). The decomposed fil-
ters were transferred quantitatively along with 7 mL 
of deionized water into polyethylene scintillation 
vials (Kartel, Italy). The content of 25 elements (Na, 
Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Ti, Cu, Zn, Fe, 
As, Se, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, Tl, Pb, Rh, Pd, and Pt) in the 
digestions was determined using a triple quadrupole 
ICP-MS (ICP-MS/MS 8800, Agilent) with two quad-
rupoles (Q1 and Q2) and an octupole reaction cell in 
different tune modes (collision/reaction, He, ­O2, and 
­NH3), working in the on mass mode and mass shift 
mode used to determine selected elements. Cd was 
analyzed in ­NH3 MS/MS mode As, and Se and Fe 
were analyzed in ­O2 MS/MS mode. The forwarded RF 
power was 1550 W, carrier gas (Ar) flow rate 1.07 L 
­min−1, and integration time per isotope was 0.3 s in 
all used modes and cell gas flow rates: helium in col-
lision single quadrupole mode: 4 mL ­min−1, ­4th cell 
gas ­(O2 in reaction MS/MS mode): 0.29 mL ­min−1, 
­3rd cell gas ­(NH3 in reaction MS/MS mode) + helium: 
4 mL ­min−1 ­NH3 + 1 mL ­min−1 He (Cigánková et al., 
2021a).

European Commission, Belgium) were digested and 
analyzed at the same conditions as samples for the 
control of the whole determination process from 
preparation to determination.
Calibration standards were prepared in a matrix 
of 2% ­HNO3 from a 1.0000 g ­L−1 stock solution of 
a single element (Analytika Prague, Czech Republic) 
mixing into one solution in the concentration range of 
0–10 mg ­L−1 for Na, Mg, Ca, K, Mn, Al, and Fe and 
0 – 100 µg ­L−1 for the rest of elements. Calibration 
curves of all elements were linear in the whole range 
(R2 = 0.9994–1.0000). Internal standard for elements 
determination were prepared from commercial 10 mg 
­L−1 mixture of Bi, Ge, In, Li, Sc, Tb, and Y (Agilent 
technologies, USA) by dilution in 2% ­HNO3 to final 
concentration 100  µg ­L−1. The tuning solution was 
prepared from commercial 10 mg.l−1 mixture of Li, 
Co, Y, Ce, Mg, and Tl (Agilent technologies, USA) to 
final concentration 1 μg ­L−1 each element in a matrix 
of 2% ­HNO3.
The accuracy of the method was periodically 
evaluated by use of two standard reference materi-
als: SRM 1640a Trace Elements in Natural Water 
(National Institute of Standards & Technology, Gaith-
ersburg, USA) and SLRS-5 River water reference 
material for trace elements (National Research Coun-
cil, Canada). In addition, a control standard (10 μg 
­L−1 calibration standard) was measured periodically 
for instrument stability control. Instrument stability 
control was online monitored using internal standard 
solution (Cigánková et al., 2021a).
2.4.2  Organic Compounds
Aerosols sampled on quartz fiber filters were ana-
lyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
and hopanes content. Recovery standards (phen-
anthrene-D10, chrysene-D12, perylene-D12, and 
ααα(20R)-cholestane-D2) were added to the filters 
prior to organic compounds extraction to compen-
sate for losses during sample preparation. The filters 
were extracted three times with 15 mL of mixture of 
a dichloromethane and hexane (v/v 1:1) for 30  min 
under ultrasonic agitation. The extracts (total 45 mL) 
were dried to 0.5 mL under a stream of nitrogen and 
fractionated by column chromatography (Křůmal 
et al., 2013). Two fractions were taken after eluting 
the prepared column with different solvents. The first 
hexane fraction (30 mL) contained hopanes and the 
second dichloromethane/hexane fraction (1:1, v/v, 
30  mL) contained PAHs. Both fractions were again 
dried to 1 mL under a gentle stream of nitrogen and 
analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass 
spectrometry (GC–MS). The GC–MS (Agilent, 
7890A, 5975C) was equipped with a capillary column 
HP5-MS (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 µm film 
thickness). A sample (1 µL) was injected. The carrier 
gas was helium (5.5) with a flow rate of 1 ml ­min−1. 
The MS was operated in electron ionization mode 
(70  eV) and in single-ion monitoring (SIM) mode 
with m/z characteristic of PAHs, hopanes, and recov-
ery standards (Křůmal et al., 2013).
Analyzed organic compounds included 20 polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., fluorene, phenanthrene, 
anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, retene, benz[a]
anthracene, chrysene, triphenylene, benzo[b]fluoran-
thene, 
benzo[j]fluoranthene, 
benzo[k]fluoranthene, 
benzo[e]pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, perylene, triphenylb-
enzene, indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, dibenz[a,h]anthra-
cene, picene, and benzo[g,h,i]perylene) and 6 hopanes 
(i.e., 17α,21β-norhopane, 17β,21α-norhopane, 17α,21β-
hopane, 17β,21α-hopane, 22S-17α,21β-homohopane,

3  Results and Discussion
3.1  PM10 Concentration and Meteorological 
Conditions
Table  1 shows the average temperature and relative 
humidity of air, global radiation, wind speed, and 
direction at the measured locations in Tulsipur and 
Charikot. Daily clocks with zero values were counted 
when calculating daily average of global radia-
tion. Measurements took place at the studied loca-
tions during the pre-monsoon (May) and monsoon 
(August) seasons, which represent two different types 
of weather conditions. The monsoon period is mostly 
accompanied by a higher temperature and higher rela-
tive humidity in the studied localities.
The concentrations of ­PM10 aerosol (µg ­m−3) 
during the monsoon and pre-monsoon period, meas-
ured with a temporal resolution of 30 min using the 
Haz-Dust monitors at selected locations in Tulsipur 
and Charikot, are shown in Fig. 2. The concentra-
tion of ­PM10 aerosols showed a seasonal trend: in 
the monsoon season, the daily ­PM10 concentra-
tions were lower than in the pre-monsoon period 
(Table  2). The lower concentration observed dur-
ing monsoon season can be attributed to washout by 
rainfall and higher relative humidity of air leading 
to reduced resuspension of street dust. In the mon-
soon period, the 24-h limit value of 50 µg.m−3 for 
human health (World Health Organization, 2006) 
for ­PM10 was significantly exceeded at the Tul-
sipur-bus station and Charikor-crossroad (Table 2). 
On the other hand, during pre-monsoon periods, 
the WHO limit value for ­PM10 was significantly 
exceeded at all locations, and the Nepal concentra-
tion limit of 150 µg.m−3 was exceeded at Tulsipur 
bus station, Tulsipur village, and Charikot hospi-
tal (Table 2). These results are consistent with the 
minimum ­PM10 level during monsoon period and 
maximum ­PM10 levels during pre-monsoon periods 
in Kathmandu Valley in the year 2005 presented by 
Giri et al., (2004, 2008) who reported the influence 
of meteorological conditions on ­PM10 concentra-
tions at different locations in the Kathmandu Val-
ley with ­PM10 levels ranging from 7 μg ­m−3 (Mat-
syagaon) to 633 μg ­m−3 (Putalisadak). Our highest 
measured 24  h concentration (182.07  μg  ­m−3) at 
Tulsipur bus station in the pre-monsoon period is 
about three times lower than the highest daily ­PM10 
average of 633  μg  ­m−3 in the Kathmandu Valley 
(Giri et al., 2008).
The ­PM10 concentrations measured in high traf-
fic areas during the present study were mostly much 
lower values than those reported by Majumder et al. 
(2012) at a network of ten high-traffic road intersec-
tions in the Kathmandu Valley, but similar or lower 
than those reported in other studies conducted in 
Nepal (Aryal et al., 2008; Giri et al., 2007, 2008).
PM10 concentrations were dynamic during the 
day, with the minimum at night and the maximum

in the morning and late afternoon at all Tulsipur 
sites in the pre-monsoon period, as traffic and 
movement on roads increased at this time (Fig. 2a, 
b, c). A similar trend was observed in the monsoon 
period (peak values in the morning and afternoon), 
but with lower maximum values (Fig. 2a, b, c). The 
highest ­PM10 concentrations were measured at traf-
fic site at both Tulsipur and Charikot. A very high 
value (668.34  μg  ­m−3) was measured in the late 
afternoon at the bus station in Tulsipur (Fig.  2a) 
in the pre-monsoon season and a concentration of 
743.22 μg ­m−3 was measured at a busy crossroad in 
Charikot (Fig.  2d) at night in the monsoon period 
and a concentration of 675.43  μg  ­m−3 in the late 
afternoon in Charikot Hospital in the monsoon 
period (Fig. 2e).
In the monsoon season, the easterly wind direction 
prevailed in Tulsipur-bus station (Fig. 3a), westerly in

Tulsipur-bank (Fig. 3c), northerly in Tulsipur-village 
(Fig.  3e), and the southerly in Charikot-crossroad 
(Fig. 3g). Throughout the measurement, the average 
wind speed in all locations was about 0.6 m ­s−1, with 
maximum values up to 0.8 m ­s−1. In the pre-monsoon 
period, the variable southwesterly wind direction pre-
vailed in Tulsipur-bus station (Fig. 3b), variable east-
erly in Tulsipur-bank (Fig.  3d) and Tulsipur-village 
(Fig.  3f). The variable southeasterly wind direction 
prevailed in Charikot-crossroad (Fig. 3h) in the pre-
monsoon period. The average wind speed was about 
4.9  m  ­s−1 throughout the measurement at all loca-
tions, with peak values up to 9.4 m ­s−1, which is com-
mon for the area during this period (www.​meteo​blue.​
com). ­PM10 concentrations correlate with wind direc-
tion at each site (Fig. 3).
3.2  Comparison PM10 Results of HAZ‑DUST 
EPAM‑5000 Analyzer and Sensor ENVEA PM 
Cairsens
The low-cost devices seem to be promising tool for 
establishing an air quality monitoring network in 
Nepal, where it is difficult to set up stationary moni-
toring stations for economic and technical reasons. 
Due to their small size and low weight, these sensors 
can also be used for mobile measurements and on 
unmanned aerial vehicles (drones).
In addition, it is necessary to focus on appropri-
ate methods of data processing (especially their vali-
dation) and subsequent interpretation of the results, 
since the measurement itself can be severely affected 
not only by the recognized lower accuracy of sen-
sor measurements (Castell et  al., 2017) but also by 
current meteorological conditions (temperature and 
humidity) or interference from various pollutants 
(especially observed especially in gaseous sensors) 
(Lewis et al., 2018).
Figure  4 shows a comparison of measured data 
from HAZ-DUST EPAM-5000 optical analyzer at a 
sampling rate of 1 per minute and ENVEA PM Cairs-
ens optical sensor at a sampling rate of 1 per minute 
at the monitored sites in Tulsipur and Charikot in the 
pre-monsoon period. The correlation coefficient (R2) 
between the raw ­PM10 sensor data and ­PM10 analyzer 
is 0.96 (RMSE is 63.4 μg ­m−3) for Tulsipur – bus sta-
tion (Fig. 4a), 0.94 (RMSE is 42.8 μg ­m−3) for Tul-
sipur – bank (Fig. 4b), 0.93 (RMSE is 76.9 μg ­m−3) 
for Tulsipur – village (Fig.  4c), 0.84 (RMSE is 
51.7 μg ­m−3) for Charikot – crossroad (Fig. 4d), and 
0.85 (RMSE is 54.6 μg ­m−3) for Charikot – hospital 
(Fig.  4e). These results indicate a good correlation 
between the low-cost sensor and the reference ana-
lyzer (i.e., Haz-Dust). The accuracy of the optical 
particle sensor was calculated as the mean error and 
maximum error compared to the ­PM10 analyzer.
It is evident that the data from both instruments 
show a similar trend, but they show differences in 
the particle concentrations measured. This is mainly 
due to the difference in measurement configuration. 
­PM10 concentrations found by Cairsens sensors 
are in average by 13.2% lower than those found by 
EPAM analyzer. Sahu et al. (2020) validated Plan-
tower PM sensor measuring ambient ­PM10 concen-
trations with that measured with optical particle 
sizers (OPS) and aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) 
at two sites in the Delhi (India) with Spearman’s 
rank-order correlations (rs = 0.64–0.83) between

date low-cost sensor for ­PM10 with an official fixed 
air quality station at a road site in Florence. For 
­PM10 RMSE of 6.1 μg ­m−3, R2 0.96 was achieved. 
However, the low–cost sensor needs to be in detail 
verified by further experiments and compared with 
monitors used in automatic airborne PM monitoring 
network.

3.3  PAHs and Hopanes
All ­PM10 samples were analyzed for PAHs and hopanes. 
PAHs are generally derived from imperfect combustion of 
organic matter. Some PAHs serve as a specific molecular 
markers for the combustion of plastics (1,3,5-triphenylb-
enzene), softwood (retene), or coal (picene). Gasoline 
vehicles emit higher concentrations of indeno[1,2,3-c,d]
pyrene, 
dibenz[a,h]anthracene 
and 
benzo[g,h,i]per-
ylene, while diesel vehicles emit higher concentrations of 
phenanthrene and pyrene (Mikuška et al., 2015; Ravindra 
et al., 2008; Simoneit et al., 2005). PAHs were present in 
low concentrations in all ­PM10 samples (Table 3). Low-
molecular weight PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, 
and acenaphthene) resulted in high losses during sample 
preparation; therefore, these PAHs were not quantified. 
Phenanthrene/anthracene, 
benz[a]anthracene/chrysene/
triphenylene, and benzo[b + j + k]fluoranthene are listed 
in the table as sum values because these compounds were 
not sufficiently separated in the GC column.

Indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, 
dibenz[a,h]anthracene, 
and benzo[g,h,i]perylene were the most abundant 
PAHs both at Tulsipur and Charikot, while lighter 
PAHs such as phenanthrene, fluoranthene, or pyrene 
were present at lower concentrations.
The measured PAH concentrations were different 
at the five sampling sites in both the monsoon and 
pre-monsoon period. In addition, the concentration of 
PAHs showed seasonal variation with concentrations 
higher in the pre-monsoon period than in the mon-
soon period at all sites (except the Tulsipur bank at a 
busy traffic junction). The mean total PAH concentra-
tions during the monsoon period were 2.4 ng ­m−3 in 
Tulsipur and 2.0 ng ­m−3 in Charikot in the monsoon 
period and 31.6 ng ­m−3 in Tulsipur and 12.2 ng ­m−3 
in Charikot in pre-monsoon period, respectively. Con-
centrations during the monsoon period were similar 
at both locations, but during pre-monsoon period, 
PAH concentrations were higher in Tulsipur than 
Charikot. A similar difference between the southern 
rural area of Nepal (Tulsipur) and the Northern Him-
alayan region of Nepal (Charikot) was recently found 
in another study (Chen et al., 2017).
Table 4 compares our results for PAHs with other 
Nepalese and foreign cities in Asia. The average val-
ues of PAHs for each location listed in the table did 
not differ between monsoon and pre-monsoon peri-
ods, except for Nanjing (urban district) in China and 
Barapani (foothills of Himalayas) in the Nepal in 
pre-monsoon season. The values at Tulsipur Bank 
(2.7 ng ­m−3), Charikot crossroad (16.2 ng ­m−3), and 
Charikot Hospital (8.2  ng  ­m−3) in the pre-monsoon 
season are lower to those reported (Wang et al., 2017) 
in Nanjing (18.1 ng ­m−3) in China and higher (except 
Charikot junction) than the value reported (Rajput 
et al., 2013) in Barapani (14.1 ng ­m−3) in Nepal in the 
pre-monsoon season.
Hopanes, which serve as coal combustion and traf-
fic markers, were found in ­PM10 samples only in the 
pre-monsoon period (Table  5). The concentrations

of some hopanes in the samples were slightly above 
the limit of detection (LOD) and were affected by 
the higher uncertainty of analytical determination, 
while the concentrations of hopanes in all monsoon 
samples were below LOD (0.080—0.302  ng/m3). 
The mean total concentration of hopanes during the 
pre-monsoon period was 1.39  ng  ­m−3 in Tulsipur 
and 0.69 ng ­m−3 in Charikot. At both sites, the high-
est concentrations were found for 17α(H),21β(H)-
norhopane that serves as a tracer for motor vehicle 
exhaust (Mikuška et al., 2015). The high concentra-
tions were found also for 17α(H),21β(H)-hopane, 
another marker of traffic.
Since the concentrations of hopanes in the air 
have not yet been measured in Nepal, we compared 
our results with urban and mountain measurements 
in China (Table  6). The concentrations of selected 
hopanes in Tulsipur and Charikot were several times 
lower than those in Baoji (urban). On the other hand, 
the concentration of 17α,21β-hopane in Tulsipur 
and Charikot was 2–5 times higher than that in Mt. 
Tai (mountain) and the concentration of 17α,21β-
norhopane was 5–14 times higher than that in Mt. Tai 
(mountain).
3.4  Elements
25 elements were analyzed in ­PM10 samples col-
lected only during monsoon period due to a failure 
of one sampler during the 1st day of sampling in the 
pre-monsoon period. The concentration of platinum 
elements (Rh, Pd, and Pt) in all samples was below 
the value of LOD. The concentrations of the other 
analyzed elements in ­PM10 are shown in Table 7 and 
Fig. 5. Al was dominant element followed by Ca, Fe, 
K, Mg, Na, and Ti in all locations except Tulsipur 
– village. High concentrations of these elements (Fe, 
Ca, Al, Mg, Na, K, and Ti) were mainly due to street 
dust resuspension of Earth crust material by wind or 
vehicle operation. Other elements were present in 
­PM10 aerosol samples at lower concentrations. The 
sum of elements in localities in Tulsipur town (15.1,

in localities in Charikot (3.28 ng ­m−3, 5.52 ng ­m−3). 
The sum of elements in localities in Tulsipur vil-
lage (3.60  ng  ­m−3) is similar to Charikot crossroad 
(3.28 ng ­m−3).
Table 8 compares our results with selected foreign 
localities. The concentrations of elements in Tul-
sipur and Charikot were higher than those reported 
by Tyagi et al. (2012) for rural and industrial sites in 
India except Cr at Tulsipur – bank. On the contrary, 
the concentrations of elements in localities in India 
are lower compared to Tulsipur and Charikot.
3.5  Source Identification
Identification of emission sources of analyzed aero-
sols and their components is currently mostly per-
formed by using various multivariate receptor models 
(Cigánková et al., 2021a; Mikuška et al., 2020; Viana 
et al., 2008). However, the use of receptor models is 
not possible in this study due to the small number of 
­PM10 samples. Therefore, the emission sources of 
the analyzed ­PM10 aerosols were identified using the 
diagnostic ratios and the content of selected organic 
markers and elements in the analyzed samples 
(Cigánková et al., 2021a; Křůmal et al., 2013, 2017; 
Mikuška et al., 2015, 2020).
The presence of retene and picene in ­PM10 samples 
proves the combustion of biomass and coal (Křůmal 
et al., 2017; Mikuška et al., 2015) as the sources of 
PAHs in analyzed ­PM10 samples, while the presence 
of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene suggests the combustions 
of plastics and waste (Simoneit et al., 2005). The high 
concentration of indeno[123-cd] pyrene, dibenz[a,h]
anthracene, and benzo[g,h,i]perylene in the ­PM10 
samples indicates vehicular emissions (particularly 
emissions from gasoline vehicles) as another emission 
source of the ­PM10 aerosols in Tulsipur and Charikot 
(Mikuška et al., 2015; Ravindra et al., 2008).
Presence of hopanes in ­PM10 aerosol samples 
indicates both traffic and coal combustion as emis-
sion source of hopanes in both Tulsipur and Charikot. 
17α(H),21β(H)-norhopane was the most abundant 
hopane, which together with high concentration of 
17α(H),21β(H)-hopane and similar concentrations 
of R and S isomer of 17α(H),21β(H)-homohopane 
proves that hopanes in Tulsipur and Charikot origi-
nated predominantly from traffic emissions.

The parental PAH ratios are calculated to identify 
the origin of PAHs (Rajput et al., 2014). Table 9 lists 
most commonly used parental PAH ratios (Rajput 
et al., 2014) calculated for aerosols collected during 
the monsoon and pre-monsoon period at selected 
sites in Tulsipur and Charikot and their comparison 
with other sites in Nepal and China. In this case, 
they are indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[g,h,i]per-
ylene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. If the ratio IndP 
/ (IndP + BghiP) is less than 0.2, it is unprocessed 
oil, if it is between 0.2 and 0.5, it is petroleum prod-
ucts combustion and the value more than 0.5 shows 
biomass and coal combustion. For the ration Fla / 
(Fla + Pyr), it is less than 0.4, it is clear that it is crude 
oil, if it is between 0.4 and 0.5, it is the combustion 
of petroleum products and the combustion of biomass 
and coal shows values more than 0.5 (Chen et  al., 
2017; Yunker et al., 2002).
Table 9 shows the diagnostic ratios of PAHs in aer-
osols during the monsoon and pre-monsoon period at 
selected sites in Tulsipur and Charikot and their com-
parison with other sites in Nepal and China. From 
the measurements, it is clear that the average IndP / 
(IndP + BghiP) ratio was higher than 0.5 during the 
measurements in the monsoon period at individual 
locations in Tulsipur and Charikot, which clearly 
indicates high pollution from biomass and coal burn-
ing. In pre-monsoon period, the ratio was less than 
0.5, suggesting combustion of petroleum products 
probably within vehicle traffic or household activities 
as a source of PAHs. For the Fla / (Fla + Pyr) ratio, 
values between 0.3 and 0.5 prevailed, indicating a 
high proportion of combustion of petroleum products.
A ratio of BeP/(BeP + BaP) due to different atmos-
pheric stability of both species is frequently used to 
distinguish local/regional sources from long range 
transport of pollutants (Mikuška 2015). In pre-mon-
soon period, the values of the ratio for both studied 
localities were smaller than 0.5 (mean value of 0.41), 
which indicates sampling of ­PM10 aerosols freshly 
emitted from the local or nearby regional emission 
sources. During monsoon period, the values of the 
ratio for both studied localities were higher than 0.5 
(mean value of 0.64), suggesting transport of sampled 
­PM10 aerosols from larger distances.
The elements analyzed in collected ­PM10 aerosols 
largely originate from various emission sources such 
as resuspension of Earth crust material (Al, Ca, Mg, 
Fe, Ti, K, etc.), industrial activity (Fe, Co, Cd, Cu, 
Cr, V, Ni, As, Ca, Mn, Sn, Zn, etc.), biomass (wood) 
burning (K, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Na, etc.), coal combus-
tion (Se, As, Cd, K, Mn, Zn, Pb, Na, Cu, Ca, Tl, Cr, 
etc.), emissions from automobile transport (Sb, Mn, 
Ba, Zn, Cu, Fe, V, Ca, Tl, Sn, Cd, Cr, Mg, Ni, and 
Pb), oil combustion (V and Ni), cement plant (Ca, Zn, 
Fe, Mn, Sb, Pb, Cd, Tl, As, Cu, Ni, etc.), and others.

Precise identification of the emission source of a par-
ticular elements is difficult because of the overlap of 
the individual emission sources (Mikuška et al., 2020; 
Tasić et al, 2017). However, some elements serve as 
markers of a certain emission source, e.g., potassium 
is considered as a good marker for biomass burning, 
while Se, As, and Cd indicate coal combustion and 
Ni and V combustion of oil. Sb, Ba, Zn, Cu, Mn, Tl, 
and Fe are important markers of traffic emissions. 
Increased concentration of thallium in ­PM10 sampled 
in Tulsipur village could indicate combustion of coal 
or production of cement in the cement factory located 
north of Tulsipur (Karbowska, 2016).
From the above, it is clear that the combustion of 
biomass (predominantly wood) and coal combined 
with the dense traffic and street dust resuspension 
is the main reasons of air pollution in the measured 
localities in Tulsipur and Charikot. In addition, the 
incineration of waste in households is another possi-
ble source of elements and PAHs. The cement factory 
located nearby Tulsipur also contributes to the com-
position of ­PM10 aerosols in Tulsipur.
4  Conclusion
In this study, PAHs, hopanes, and elements were 
analyzed in ­PM10 aerosols collected in Tulsipur and 
Charikot in Nepal in monsoon and pre-monsoon 
period. The ­PM10 aerosols and their components were 
analyzed for the first time in these Nepalese cities. 
In addition, the concentrations of hopanes and ele-
ments in ­PM10 aerosols have not yet been measured 
in Nepal.
The WHO 24-h limit value of 50 µg ­m−3 and the 
Nepal concentration limit of 150 µg ­m−3 for human 
health for ­PM10 was significantly exceeded in the 
pre-monsoon periods. The concentrations of ­PM10 
and analyzed organic components (i.e., PAHs and 
hopanes) showed seasonal variations in both Tulsipur 
and Charikot, with lower concentrations in monsoon 
period and the higher values in pre-monsoon period. 
The lower concentration observed during monsoon 
season can be attributed to washout by rainfall of 
aerosols and higher relative humidity of air leading to 
reduced resuspension of street dust.
Traffic, biomass (mainly wood) burning, and 
coal combustion were identified as prevailing local 
sources of PAHs and several elements analyzed in 
­PM10 aerosols sampled in Tulsipur and Charikot. The 
incineration of waste in households was suggested 
as another source of elements and PAHs. Aluminum 
and other elements of Earth crust material in ­PM10 
aerosol samples originate predominantly from street 
dust resuspension. Calcium, thallium, and other ele-
ments found in Tulsipur samples may be emitted by 
the cement factory located nearby Tulsipur. The traf-
fic was suggested as the prevailing emission source of 
hopanes in Tulsipur and Charikot.
The value of diagnostic ratio IndP/(IndP + BghiP) 
during post-monsoon period indicates pollution due 
to combustion of biomass and coal, while during 
pre-monsoon period indicates pollution due to petro-
leum combustion. The ratio Fla / (Fla + Pyr) indicates 
petroleum product combustion during both pre-mon-
soon and monsoon period.
The diagnostic ratio BaP/(BeP + BaP) indicates 
emission of ­PM10 aerosols prevaily from the local 
or nearby regional emission sources in pre-monsoon 
period, while during monsoon period, the ratio for 
both studied localities suggests transport of sampled 
­PM10 aerosols from larger distances.
