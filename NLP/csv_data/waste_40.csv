Abstract
Open municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion is a major emission source of particulate air pollution, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and more exotic hazardous organic pollutants including polychlorinated biphenyls and brominated flame retar-
dants. However, the adverse impact of MSW combustion emission on health among the general population is unknown.
Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted to explore the associations between potential exposure to MSW combustion-
related air pollution and symptoms of adverse health effects among residents of a community adjacent to a large open landfill in
Lagos, Nigeria. Using ordinal logistic regression and controlling for age, sex, and smoking, it was observed that residence for ≥
11 years had increased odds (p < 0.05) of daily occurrence of tingling/numbness/whiteness of fingers (2.614), headaches (2.725),
memory problems (2.869), tremor/cramps (2.748), and confusion (3.033) among other symptoms. These results indicate adverse
health impacts of chronic exposure to MSW combustion emission.

Introduction
Uncontrolled open municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion
is a major source of ambient air pollution with a contribution
of 29% of anthropogenic release of fine particulate matter
(PM2.5: PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) into
ambient air (Wiedinmyer et al. 2014). Open burning of
MSW is a global activity of public health concern. It occurs
in high income countries (HICs) mostly in less densely popu-
lated rural areas, but on a more intense scale in low and
middle-income countries (LMICs) (Kodros et al. 2016;
Wiedinmyer et al. 2014). Open MSW combustion in many
LMICs often occurs on large dumpsites that are located in
highly populated urban metropolitan areas (Kodros et al.
2016). Consequently, there is potential for exposure of sub-
stantial populations to resultant emissions.
Although, evidence indicates that open MSW combustion
smoke may negatively affect lung function and birth outcome
(Amegah et al. 2012; Gumede and Savage 2017), the adverse
health impacts have not been studied extensively.
Nonetheless, its potential impact on human health can be in-
ferred from its composition. As a major contributor to ambient
air PM2.5 which is the leading environmental risk factor for
respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
(Cohen et al. 2017; Lim et al. 2012), the impact is likely to
be substantial. In the recent estimate from the Global Burden
of Disease study, smoke from open MSW combustion caused
270,000 premature adult deaths annually (Kodros et al. 2016).

This estimation is an extrapolation, and is not based on orig-
inal data about the independent adverse health effects of air
pollution from open MSW combustion.
Smoke and PM emitted from open MSW combustion can
be more varied in their composition compared to emissions
from the more traditional and well-studied ambient air pollu-
tion sources including traffic and combustion of biomass fuels
(Das et al. 2018; Nagpure et al. 2015; Wiedinmyer et al.
2014). Some components of MSW, including garbage, recy-
clables, electronics, and other household/consumer products,
contain hazardous materials (Oladapo et al. 2012).
Consequently, the burning of MSW results in the generation
of more typical combustion-related PM constituents such as
metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and di-
oxins, and more exotic organics including polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers
(PBDEs) that are used as flame retardants in household and
electrical products (Fierens et al. 2007; Gullett et al. 2009;
Hogarh et al. 2018; Wiedinmyer et al. 2014). Dioxins,
PCBs, and PBDEs are persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
with biological half-lives that are between few and 20 years
(Ogura 2004), and can cause adverse effects beyond the respi-
ratory and cardiovascular systems (Berghuis et al. 2015;
Mocarelli et al. 2007; Vested et al. 2014). Some of these
compounds are endocrine disrupting and may cause reproduc-
tive and developmental toxicity. Exposures to them have also
been associated with diabetes (De Tata 2014; Lim et al. 2008;
Longnecker and Michalek 2000; Silverstone et al. 2012).
As air pollution from MSW combustion emission is unique
and its adverse health effects in the general population remains
largely uninvestigated (Kodros et al. 2016), it is therefore of
value to elucidate the independent health effects of emissions
from open MSW combustion. We conducted an exploratory
study to investigate the potential respiratory, neurological, and
cardiovascular effects of chronic exposure to MSW
combustion-related air pollution. We conducted the study
within the context of residence (living or working) in areas
adjacent to a very large open dumpsite (103 acres large and 10
stories tall) that is located in Lagos, Nigeria. Specifically, we
examined the relationships between the duration of residence
and frequencies of various respiratory, neurological, and car-
diovascular symptoms.
Methods
This was a cross-sectional study conducted in July 2015 at and
around the Olusosun landfill located in the Ojota area of
Lagos, Nigeria. The Olusosun landfill is one of the largest in
the world and the largest in Africa (Ife-Adediran and Isabota
2018; Kalu 2018). It is located within the Lagos metropolis in
close proximity to homes and business premises. The waste
stream flowing into this landfill (more precisely a dumpsite or
open landfill) includes garbage, recyclables, electronics, and
household consumer products. Fires occur regularly at this
landfill, either spontaneously, as a result of the natural out-
come of combustion of trapped gases such as methane, or due
to the incineration activities of scavengers (LASG n.d.;
Ogunrinola and Adepegba 2012; Oladapo et al. 2012).
Study area
The study area consisted of two streets in residential areas that
are in proximity (within 1000 m) of the landfill. We carefully
selected these streets to ensure that they were away from in-
dustrial sources of emission by ensuring there were no facto-
ries within 5 km of the sampling locations.
To demonstrate potential high levels of exposure to pollut-
ants at the landfill and the selected adjacent streets, we obtain-
ed multiple instantaneous measurements of ambient air con-
centrations of gaseous pollutants including carbon monoxide
(CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NO2), ammo-
nia (NH3), and Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as well as volatile
organic compounds (VOC) at eight locations within the
dumpsite and two locations on each of the two selected resi-
dential streets adjacent to the dumpsite. ToxiRAE II single gas
monitors (Honeywell, Charlotte, NC) were used to measure
CO (measurement range, 0–500 ppm; resolution, 1 ppm), SO2
(0–20 ppm; 0.1 ppm), NO2 (0–20 ppm; 0.1 ppm), and NH3
(0–50 ppm; 1 ppm). GasAlert Quattro multi gas monitor was
used to measure H2S (0–200 ppm; 1 ppm) and VOC (0–
100 ppm; 1 ppm). The equipment takes multiple measure-
ments over a 10-min duration and when saturated produces
the mean concentrations of the pollutants measured. We also
obtained noise levels measured by an Extech 407730 (Extech
Instruments, Waltham, MA) digital sound level meter (± 2 dB
accuracy; 0.1 dB resolution) that is equipped with a 12.7-mm
electrets condenser at these locations. For comparison, we
measured the level of these pollutants and noise levels at the
University of Lagos Botanical gardens, which is a serene en-
vironment that is located 10 miles upwind from the dumpsite
to serve as a control site.
Participant selection and questionnaire
administration
We included consecutively consenting adolescents and adults
aged 16 years and above who either lived or worked in build-
ings located along the two selected streets adjacent to the
landfill. Using a structured questionnaire administered by
trained field workers during a face-to-face interview, we ob-
tained demographic information (age, sex), residential status
(living or working), years of residence, smoking status (yes or
no), the daily number of cigarette if currently smoking, and the
frequencies of respiratory, neurological, dermatological, gas-
trointestinal, and musculoskeletal symptoms. The responses
30886
Environ Sci Pollut Res (2020) 27:30885–30892
for the frequencies of symptoms were “rarely,” “less often
than once a week,” “at least once a week,” and “daily.”
Informed consent was obtained from each of the subjects prior
to participation in the study.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics (Wald Chi-square tests) were used to
determine differences in the distribution of the participants
across the categories of the potential confounders (age, sex,
and smoking status) and frequencies of symptoms by the res-
idential status or years of residence. Ordinal logistic regression
models were used to examine the cross-sectional associations
of residential status and years of residence (exposures) with
self-reported frequency of symptoms (outcome). Odds ratios
were estimated for exposures and the associated outcome:
comparing reported “daily” symptoms to the “less frequent”
symptoms referent group. Models were adjusted for age, sex,
and smoking status. All analyses were performed using SAS
version 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p < 0.05
for all analyses.
Results
Study subjects
The demographic information about the study participants ac-
cording to their residential status (whether living or working in
the exposed community adjacent to the dumpsite) or duration
of residence is presented in Table 1. More of the participants
(52%) worked vs. lived in the exposed community, while the
majority (42%) were residents for 0–5 years. Sixty percent of
the study participants were male. Expectedly, age was associ-
ated with the duration of residence with the oldest participants
being the likeliest to have been residents for more than
10 years. Sixty-two percent of the male participants had been
residents for more than 5 years. Ever smokers were more
likely to have been residents of the community for 0–5 years.
Ambient air pollutant concentrations
All instantaneous instrument readings were non-detects for
the concentrations of the criteria gaseous pollutant (CO,
SO2, NO2), other inorganic gases (NH3, H2S), and VOCs for
the control site, 10 miles away from the dumpsite. Detectable
amounts of these pollutants were measured at the dumpsite
and the exposed community surrounding it. As indicated by
the maximum values in the range of measurements that are
presented in Table 2, elevated concentrations relative to the
United States National Ambient Air Quality Standards
(NAAQS) and/or the Nigerian NAAQS were measured on
occasions at the dumpsite and in the exposed community for
some of the pollutants: once for CO (9.2 ppm), NO2 (150 ppb)
and SO2 (100 ppb) NH3 (0.5 ppm) and NO2 (150 ppb); twice
for H2S (0.4, 1 ppm); and four times for SO2 (200, 500, 1500,
2100 ppb) (FEPA 1991; USEPA 2018).
Frequency of symptoms
The distribution of the participants across residential duration
and status with regard to the frequencies of symptoms and the
unadjusted chi-square statistic is provided in Supplementary
Table 1. There was no apparent difference in self-reported
frequencies of symptoms based on residential status.
However, self-reported frequencies of memory problems,
tremors or cramps, and joint problems were significantly as-
sociated with the duration of residence (p = 0.015, 0.029,
0.014, respectively) Supplementary Table 1). In addition,
there was noticeable significant (p < 0.05) linear trend (in-
creased frequency with increased duration of residence) for
most of the symptoms (Supplementary Table 2).
After adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, persons
living compared to working in the exposed community tended
to report more frequent (daily) symptoms (odds ratio [OR]
was between 1.074 and 1.811), with statistical significance
only being observed for extreme fatigue with an OR of
1.811(95% confidence interval: 1.014–3.234) (Table 3).
Duration of residence was associated with frequency of symp-
toms, with higher odds of self-reported daily symptoms for
persons who had been residents (living or working) in the
exposed community for 6–10 or ≥11 years for most (11 of
16) or all the symptoms respectively compared with residents
for 0–5 years (Table 4). The odds ratio of daily symptoms was
always highest for those who had been residents for ≥11 years.
Significantly (p = 0.05) increased odds of more frequent head-
aches (OR: 2.725), tingling/numbness/whiteness of fingers
(2.614), confusion (3.033), memory problems (2.869), ex-
treme fatigue (2.748), insomnia (3.386), tremor/cramps
(2.882), problems with joints (3.741), and backaches (3.110)
was observed in association with residence ≥11 years.
Marginal significantly increased odds (p > 0.05 and < 0.1) of
chest tightness (2.383) and ear/nose/throat irritation (2.317)
was also observed among this group of participants.
Discussion
Although, open MSW combustion is pervasive and is a sub-
stantial source of ambient air pollution, knowledge about the
independent health effects of its emissions is limited.
Nonetheless, the constituents of the smoke that is emitted
include particulate matter, PAHs, inorganic gases, and metals,
which are major hazards and potentially cause pulmonary and
neurological adverse effects (Kodros et al. 2016; Wiedinmyer
30887
Environ Sci Pollut Res (2020) 27:30885–30892
et al. 2014); Babadjouni et al. 2017; Cohen et al. 2017;
Kioumourtzoglou et al. 2015; Laumbach and Kipen 2012).
We postulated that potentially increased exposure to such
emissions would be associated with higher frequencies of pul-
monary and neurological effects, and our findings appear to
align with this hypothesis.
Specifically, increase in residence time in areas adjacent to
Olusosun dumpsite is associated with self-reported increase in
the frequencies of respiratory (chest tightness, difficulty in
breathing, and era/nose/throat irritation), neurological (head-
ache, tingling/numbness/whiteness of fingers, memory prob-
lems, extreme fatigue, tremor/cramps, and insomnia), and
musculoskeletal (backaches and problems with joints) symp-
toms. The odds of reporting daily vs. less frequent occurrence
of these symptoms increased with longer residence time after
adjusting for age, sex, residence status (living vs. working in
the area), and smoking status. The odds for persons who had
lived/worked in the area for ≥11 years compared to those who
had done so for ≤5 years was at least double. Although, not
significant, the odds ratios of increase in self-reported frequen-
cies of 12 out of the 16 symptoms were higher than 1.0 for
persons who had lived/worked in the area for 5–10 years com-
pared with the referent group. Odds ratios for this group rela-
tive to the referent were below but close to 1.0 and not signif-
icant for the other four symptoms including three that are
respiratory and one that is gastrointestinal. While we cannot
definitively provide explanations, cross-sectional collection of
information and small sample size could have accounted for
why odds were lower for the 5–10-year group for these four
symptoms. Nevertheless, the odds ratios were higher for most
of the respiratory and neurological symptoms in persons in
both groups that had lived/worked longer in the area. There
is further evidence that longer residence time and, by exten-
sion, exposure to emissions from combustion of waste at the
dumpsite are detrimental to respiratory and neurological
health within the data. Persons who lived in the area, and
presumably spent more time in the area adjacent to the
dumpsite, tended to have higher odds of reporting more fre-
quent symptoms, although none of the odd ratios were signif-
icant except for extreme fatigue.
As previously noted, and as the air pollutant measurement
data demonstrate, combustion of MSW at Olusosun landfill
results in emission of PM and other hazardous air pollutants to
which neighboring residents could be exposed putting them at
greater risk of adverse effects. Previous studies have also as-
sociated exposure to combustion-derived indoor and outdoor
air pollution with respiratory and neurological symptoms such
as was observed in this present study (Bernstein et al. 2008;
Dales et al. 2009; Kampa and Castanas 2008; Lai et al. 2010;
Patel et al. 2010; Schikowski et al. 2010; Xu et al. 2016). We
also observed an unexpected association between duration of
living/working in the community adjacent to the site and mus-
culoskeletal symptoms, specifically backaches and joint prob-
lems. This observation is likely due to factors different from

combustion emissions from the dumpsite as associations be-
tween air pollution and musculoskeletal symptoms have not
been reported in the literature. While work at the dumpsite is a
plausible reason, higher odds of self-reported increase in the
frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms was reported by per-
sons living vs. those working in the community. However, we
did not collect information about the occupation of the study
participants. Nonetheless, a higher probability of engagement
in strenuous work by persons who had lived/worked longest
within the community remains a plausible explanation as such
persons are more likely to be of the lower socio-economic
class, who are also more likely to be engaged in physically
demanding occupations which is the major extrinsic risk fac-
tor for backaches and joint problems (Leino-Arjas et al. 1998;
Roffey et al. 2010; Wai et al. 2010; Yucesoy et al. 2015).
There is very limited data reporting on the health of persons
potentially exposed to pollution from dumpsites or open land-
fills. Previous data is mostly from occupational exposure by
workers at such facilities. In an Indian study, workers at an
open landfill were at higher risks of reporting respiratory (si-
nusitis, running or stuffy nose, common cold, frequent sneez-
ing, dry cough, wheezing, and chest discomfort) and neuro-
logical (headaches, tingling/numbness, transient loss of mem-
ory, blurred vision, burning sensation in extremity, and de-
pression) symptoms compared with non-landfill worker con-
trols (Ray et al. 2005). Similar results were observed in a study
of landfill workers across Virginia (Kitsantas et al. 2000), and
among waste collection and waste disposal workers in Greece
and Italy (Athanasiou et al. 2010; Vimercati et al. 2016).
Furthermore, reduced spirometry measures (forced vital

capacity or forced expiratory volume in 1 s) have been report-
ed among waste collection and waste disposal workers relative
to controls (Kitsantas et al. 2000; Vimercati et al. 2016).
However, it is noteworthy that both the present study and
previous studies did not measure personal exposures to air
pollution, and direct physical contact to biohazards may con-
tribute to symptoms among the landfill workers (Athanasiou
et al. 2010; Kitsantas et al. 2000; Ray et al. 2005; Vimercati
et al. 2016). Nonetheless, the outcomes that we have observed
is similar to those among land fill workers as well as those
associated with emissions from other combustion sources
(e.g., traffic exhaust and smoke from residential combustion
of biomass); making it plausible to infer that there may be a
relationship with emission from combustion at the dumpsite
(Bayer-Oglesby et al. 2006; Desalu et al. 2010; Diaz et al.
2007; Henderson and Johnston 2012; Ho et al. 2014;
Langrish et al. 2012; Nachman and Parker 2012; Pope et al.
2014; Romieu et al. 2009; Schikowski et al. 2010; Xu et al.
2016). Additionally, restrictive lung function impairment has
been reported in most (65%) children that lived within a 2-mi
radius of a landfill in a recent study from South Africa
(Gumede and Savage 2017).
Waste incinerator offers a much cleaner combustion pro-
cess compared to open MSW burning, but it is also not free
from adverse health outcomes and may not be the most ap-
propriate alternative waste disposal option. Residence in a
community adjacent to a waste incinerator was associated
with increased risk of respiratory symptoms (wheeze and
morning cough/phlegm) (Mohan et al. 2000). Results of other
studies related to incinerators indicate that exposure to emis-
sions from waste combustion could be risk factors for more
debilitating health outcomes including cancers and adverse
birth outcomes (preterm delivery) (Ancona et al. 2015;
Candela et al. 2013; García-Pérez et al. 2013; Vinceti et al.
2008). Similarly, residential garbage burning by pregnant
women has been associated with a 195% increase in risk of
low birth weight of the offspring (Amegah et al. 2012).
We note that the results of this study are limited by the lack
of specific exposure measures. Residence time of the partici-
pants in the community was used as a surrogate exposure
measure, and their personal exposures to contaminants specif-
ic to garbage combustion were not monitored. However, ele-
vated concentrations of combustion-related air pollutants in-
cluding CO, NO2, and SO2 were detected in the community in
area samples, whereas they were not detected in the control
site. Although, we adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status in
our analyses, some of the study findings might be explained
by residual confounding. Nonetheless, all participants were
residents of the same community, and potential confounding
exposures that are pervasive such as traffic are not expected to
vary by a large degree among the study participants within the
same periods. It should be noted that exposure to emissions
that are not combustion-related might also cause adverse re-
spiratory and neurological outcomes (Heaney et al. 2011). For
example, ammonia and H2S were detected in area samples in
the community adjacent to this landfill. While these air pol-
lutants may be released by waste combustion (Rim-Rukeh
2014; Wiedinmyer et al. 2014), they may also be produced
by decaying organic materials within the landfill (Behera et al.
2013; Heaney et al. 2011). Finally, due to small sample sizes,

we collapsed the categories of symptom frequencies and ana-
lyzed the odds of reporting symptoms “daily” or “at least once
a week” vs. “rarely” or “less often than once a week.”
Although the estimates for some of the odds ratios became
insignificant, the results remained consistent for the odds of
reporting more frequent symptoms according to residential
status (living > working in study area) and duration of resi-
dence (≥11 years > 6–10 years > 0–5 years).
Conclusion
In conclusion, we observed that potentially increased risk of
exposure to combustion-related emissions from an open land-
fill based on residence adjacent to the landfill is associated
with increased frequencies of respiratory, neurological, and
musculoskeletal symptoms. Increased frequencies of the
symptoms were self-reported among those who had lived/
worked longest (≥11 years) relative to those who had done
so for 0–5 years. Further research is needed to quantify the
level of personal exposure to these emissions to corroborate or
refute the association with adverse health outcomes.

Abstract
India, a highly populated economy in transition generates huge quantity of municipal solid wastes and its management is 
posing great challenges. Infrastructural limitations force the urban local bodies to rely on traditional routes such as open 
dumpyards and landfills, where incidents of massive fire breakouts are often reported. In places where the collection system 
fails, the public seeks a much easier option of open burning of wastes in streets and households. The study reports a com-
parative assessment of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dl-PCBs emitted to air and residue during the repetitive incidents of massive fire 
breakouts at a municipal solid waste dumpyard and localized street waste burning in cities of India. The study also evaluated 
the direct exposure routes viz. inhalation as well as dermal and predicts the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks 
to the receiving population. The observed PCDD/F levels in the ambient air and burned residue samples ranged from 2.7 to 
41.4 pgTEQ/m3 and 79.8 to 860 ngTEQ/kg, while that of dl-PCB varied from 0.2 to 2.3 pgTEQ/m3 and 6.0 to 46.2 ngTEQ/
kg respectively. The dermal, as well as the inhalation daily exposure doses were estimated and the non-carcinogenic hazard 
indices of the children were found to be in levels of concern at two of the street burning sites while for adults the levels were 
found to be within the threshold limit. The cumulative Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) values ranged from 2 × ­10–6 
to 2 × ­10–4 suggesting moderate to low risk to cancer or cancer-linked illnesses to exposed individuals.

Introduction
The domestic and commercial non-hazardous garbage gen-
erated from the community life activities poses great chal-
lenges in its management due to the variable compositions, 
high moisture content, fast putrescible nature and huge 
volume of generation (Nandy et al. 2015). Several factors 
such as outdated waste collection mechanisms, unskilled 
manpower, inadequate infrastructure, lack of scientific and 
professional approach in selecting suitable treatment pro-
cesses and implementation of regulations are some of the 
major challenges for developing nations in the manage-
ment of municipal solid wastes (MSW) (Ramaswami et al. 
2016). India also faces significant difficulties in MSW 
management and out of the total generated solid waste 
quantity, only 20–30% gets treated while the remaining 
70–80% ends up in smaller residential/street open dumps 
or larger MSW dumpyards (Sharma and Jain 2019). The 
indiscriminate dumping of wastes over the past few dec-
ades has led to the formation of several legacy dumpyards 
in India and the majority of them are devoid of any sci-
entific or engineering measures to monitor or manage the 
formation of landfill gases (LFGs) (Waste Atlas, Sharma 
et al. 2019). Incidents of fires are very frequent in these 
landfill/dumpyard sites such as Ghazipur (Delhi), Deonar 
(Mumbai), Dhapa (Kolkata), Brahmapuram (Kochi) etc., 
which are triggered by combustible gases generated from 
heaps of putrescible wastes and burns out several hundred 
tons of waste every year (Annepu 2012; Project report 
on Indo-German initiatives: A case of waste management 
2016).
Moreover, the non-hazardous nature of the MSW allows 
people to experiment and practice various options such as 
littering in streets, disposing of in running waters, open 
burning etc. and is observed commonly across India. The 
general public considers the open burning of MSW as a 
cheap and easy way to reduce waste volume and also to 
get rid of the associated smell, infectious vector breeding 
conditions, scavenging animals etc. (Kumar et al. 2015; 
Vreeland et al. 2016). Several studies reported that the 
uncontrolled combustion of MSW could lead to the emis-
sion of highly toxic fumes and respirable particulates into 
the breathing zones of the atmosphere. In addition, the 
dispersion of burned residue can contaminate the soil, 
surface and groundwater and sediments, all of which may 
finally reach the human food chain (Lemieux 2002). It was 
identified that open burning of MSW is a major source 
of unintentional persistent organic pollutants (U-POPs) 
such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlo-
rinated biphenyls (PCBs) (commonly called dioxin-like 
POPs or dl-POPs) and hence has been notified as a source 
category in the ‘standardized toolkit for identification and 
quantification of dioxin and furan releases’ laid down by 
UNEP (Fiedler 2007). Considering its persistent, bio-
accumulative and toxic properties, the dl-POPs have been 
classified as class-A carcinogens by International Agency 
for Research in Cancer (IARC) (McGregor et al. 1998). 
Hitherto, several studies reported high levels of dioxins 
and PCBs (4–4000 times) than that of control sites in the 
ambient air followed by biomass combustion, landfill or 
dumpyard fire breakouts (Shih et al. 2008; Fajkovic et al. 
2018; Mazzucco et al. 2020; Weichenthal et al. 2015).
It can be noticed that massive fire breakout incidents 
in legacy dumpyards/landfill sites receive quick public 
attention as the spontaneous emission of thick smoke and 
possible allergies and breathing difficulties to people in 
the locality force the authorities to take necessary steps to 
extinguish the fire and to monitor the situation. Whereas 
the small-scale littering and burning of wastes in open 
places, roadsides, backyards etc. are often ignored by 
citizens as well as authorities since the discomfort caused 
by smoke/particulate emissions are relatively negligible 
owing to the lower volume of waste burned at any par-
ticular instance. Although the unit quantity of waste dis-
posed of is less, such incidents occur routinely in several 
parts of a city and hence the annual cumulative emission 
will be much higher but are mostly ignored (Wiedinmyer 
et al. 2014; Cogut 2016). Often such waste heaps in streets 
will remain smoldering throughout the day, which are the 
most favourable conditions for the formation of products 
of incomplete combustions. Another danger associated 
with the episodes of street open burning is its close vicin-
ity to residential, educational and commercial activities, 
where the probability of human exposure is high compared 
with relatively suburban located legacy dumpyard/land-
fill sites. Several studies reported the interdependence of 
adverse health effects and proximity of community life 
settlement to the dumpyard/landfill site, but investigations 
on the risks posed by street open burnings are very limited 
(Porta et al. 2009).
The present study has undertaken onsite ambient air and 
residual ash sampling followed by estimation and congener 
fingerprinting of the dl-POPs emitted during the massive 
fire breakout incidents at Brahmapuram MSW dumpyard 
and open burning of wastes in streets in urban city centres 
of Kerala, India. A detailed investigation to understand the 
daily exposure doses arising from the inhalation and dermal 
routes were carried out for two age groups (children and 
adults) and both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks 
associated with the exposures were estimated. A quantitative 
assessment of the human health risk posed by the dl-POPs 
emission from the routine small-scale street burning prac-
tices and its comparison with that of massive dumpyard fires 
is the first such study reported to the best of our knowledge.

Methods
Sampling Sites
Street Waste Burning Sites
Three major roadside dumping sites in Thiruvanan-
thapuram, Kerala—Pettah (8° 29′ 44″ N, 76° 55′ 49″ 
E), Thakarapparambu (8° 29′ 11″ N, 76° 56′ 45″ E) and 
Attakulangara (8° 28′ 46″ N, 76° 57′ 4″ E) were selected 
for the study (Fig. 1). The sites are situated in the Thiru-
vananthapuram corporation region (capital of the state 
of Kerala) where regular intentional/un-intentional waste 
open burning events are reported. The ambient air high 
volume PUF samplers were operated at approximately 
2–5 m distant from the waste pile and are closer to the 
routine movement of the general public. The ambient 
air sampling at Pettah and Attakulangara was operated 
continuously for 22 and 25 h respectively in one stretch 
whereas at Thakarapparambu smoke ceased two times 
and correspondingly sampler was also switched off and 
restarted upon re-ignition and visible smoke generation to 
avoid dilution while ensuring collection of approximately 
300 ­m3 of the air sample.
Accidental Fire Breakout Site at Brahmapuram MSW 
Dumpyard, Kerala
The Brahmapuram MSW treatment centre and dumping site 
(9° 59′ 28″ N, 76° 21′ 59″ E) is situated very close to the 
Smart city project, Kochi, the commercial capital of the state 
of Kerala and is approximately 7 km away from the city 
centre (Fig. 1). The plant receives approximately 350–400 
tons of MSW per day. Presently the material recovery and 
composting units are non-functional/partially operated and 
hence a major share of waste received goes to open dumping 
and approximately 6 lakh tons of legacy wastes are dumped 
over 60 acres of land (Kochi Waste to Energy Project 2018). 
The dl-POPs emission during two major fire breakout inci-
dents reported at the site: one in 2019 (22rd–25th February 
2019) and the second in 2020 (18th–20th February 2020) 
were investigated in the present study. The air samples were 
collected at about 150–170 m away from the epicenter of the 
fire where the settlements of plant workers were located. The 
farther distance from the epicenter was chosen for operating 
the samplers to ensure the safety of the supporting staff and 
samplers from any possible escalation of fire. As the power 
supply to the area was disconnected due to fire hazards, a 
diesel-powered generator (Hitachi Corporation, Japan) was 
utilized for the uninterrupted operation of PUF samplers.
Sampling Procedure
The high-volume ambient air sampler (APM 460, Envirotech 
Instruments Pvt. Ltd, India) was used for the ambient air 
sampling consisted of a stainless-steel filter paper holder 
which can accommodate 25 × 20 cm filter paper, 15 cm long 
cylindrical glass-lined cartridge to hold polyurethane foam 
(PUF) media and a timer to set the sampling time. The glass 
made PUF cartridge was pre-cleaned by rinsing with acetone 
and the PUF plugs were Soxhlet extracted for 16 h with 
toluene and dried under high purity nitrogen gas to elimi-
nate possibilities of cross-contamination before every sam-
pling. Pre-weighed Whatman quartz micro-fibre filter (QFF) 
papers were used for the particulate phase collection and the 
PUF plugs were spiked with 100 pg of sampling standards 
(13C-labelled congeners of 1234 TCDF, 1234 TCDD, PCB 
79, PCB 60, PCB 127, PCB 159) to evaluate the sampling 
efficiency.
Two air samples each from two fire breakout incidents at 
Brahmapuram reported in 2019 & 2020 respectively and one 
sample each from street waste burnings at Pettah, Thakarap-
parambu and Attakulangara were collected for the present 
study. The air sampling was carried out in such a way that as 
far as possible a minimum of 300 ­m3 of air at a sampling rate 
of 200 LPM was collected (USEPA method TO-9A 1999). 
It was not attained during the dumpyard fire incident at 
Brahmapuram due to delays in reporting of the incident and 
logistics from CSIR-NIIST located (350 km away) from the 
site of occurrence. At Brahmapuram dumpyard site, burned 
residue samples were collected from 4–5 points each from 
two of the fire ridden MSW heaps and were made into 2 Nos 
of composite samples representing each heap through con-
ing and quartering method. One composite burned residue 
sample from each of the street waste burning sites at Pettah, 
Thakarapparambu and Attakulangara were also collected.
Sample Analysis
All the samples were extracted within 30 days from the date 
of sampling and analyzed within 45 days from the date of 
extraction. The QFF and PUF plugs were retrieved from 
the sampler and the final weight of the QFF was noted for 
calculating PM concentration. The mass-labelled (13C) con-
geners of PCDD/Fs—17 nos (100 pg each) and MO&NO-
PCBs—12 nos (500 pg each) were spiked onto the PUF 
plugs before extraction as internal standards (ISTD) to 
assess analytical recovery. The glass cartridge was rinsed 
with acetone followed by toluene for the complete transfer 
of residues. The rinsates were concentrated using a rotary 
evaporator (R-300, Buchi Corporation, Switzerland) and fur-
ther added into the Soxhlet extractor solvent flask. The QFF 
and PUF were extracted together in a Soxhlet system with 
toluene as charging solvent for 16 h at 5 siphons per hour.

The burned residue samples were dried in a hot air oven at 
103 °C for 3 h to remove moisture content, weighed 5 g of 
dried sample, mixed with an equal amount of sodium sulfate 
to remove any residual moisture and were spiked with ­C13 
labelled internal standards before Soxhlet extraction. The 
sample extracts were then concentrated using a rotary evapo-
rator and were cleaned up and fractionated using three col-
umn based (Multilayer silica column, Alumina column and

carbon column) automated system (DEXTech Pure, LCTech, 
Germany). The first fraction was obtained as 1:1 DCM: Hex-
ane solution containing MO & NDL PCBs and the second 
fraction as toluene containing PCDD/F and NO-PCBs. A 
nitrogen evaporator (Supervap-6, FMS Inc, USA) was used 
for concentrating the sample fractions to dryness. Both the 
sample fractions were then spiked with 20 pg syringe stand-
ards (1278 TCDF, 123468 HxCDF, 1234689 HpCDF) and 
100 pg (PCB 70, 111, 170) respectively, and finally recon-
stituted in 200 µL n-nonane.
GC-triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Model: 
7890B/7000C, Agilent Technologies, Germany) was used 
for the quantitative analysis. The MS/MS was operated in 
electron ionization mode (EI) at 70 eV coupled with the 
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for quantifica-
tion. The GC injection was made through solvent vent mode 
at 120 °C and the injection volume was 4 µL. 60 m DB-5MS 
UI (Agilent technologies, Germany) GC column was used 
(0.25 um film thickness, 0.25 mm internal diameter) for the 
analysis. The GC oven temperature program for the PCDD/F 
analysis was from 60 to 325 through three ramps with rates 
30 °C/min, 2 °C/min and 10 °C/min. The final hold time 
was 5 min and the total run time was 35.5 min. The carrier 
gas (helium) flow rate was static 1 mL/min and MS source 
temperature was 330 °C.
Analytical Quality Control
Isotopic dilution mass spectrometric method was employed 
for the confirmatory analysis of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs 
(dl-POPs) and hence the obtained individual native con-
gener concentrations were corrected with internal standard 
recoveries of the corresponding 13C labelled congeners. The 
WHO-2005 TEF factors of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were 
used for calculating the final TEQ (Van Den Berg et al. 
2006). The ISTD recoveries for the corresponding congeners 
should be in the range of 60–120%. The deviations if any, 
was acceptable only when the contribution of the congener 
to total TEQ is less than 10%.
The limit of quantification (LOQ) for all the congeners 
under the study was calculated from the lowest acceptable 
calibration point complying with the validation criteria 
specified for GC–MS/MS as per EU regulations 644/2017 
such as (i) the relative response factor (RRF) ≤ 30% (ii) rela-
tive standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 15% (iii) relative ion ratio 
tolerance ˂ 15% (EU (No.) 644/2017). The on-column con-
centration corresponding to the particular calibration point 
was considered as the LOQ (Law et al. 2018, L’Homme 
et al. 2015). For the congeners found below the limit of 
quantification (LOQ), the upper bound levels were taken 
as LOQ during the calculation of the final TEQ as specified 
in standard reporting protocols of dl-POPs. As the study 
was targeted to assess the human exposures to PCDD/F and 
dl-PCB emissions, upper bound levels obtained from the 
analysis were considered for all exposure dose calculations. 
To understand the background levels from any other sources 
such as vehicular exhausts in pristine and urban locations, 
a control and field blank site sampling were also carried 
out in the study. CSIR-NIIST institute campus was taken as 
the control site where no open littering and burning activity 
is practiced and field blank sample was collected from the 
Thakarapparambu site on a day when open burning activity 
was not occurring. The control and a field blank ambient air 
levels were used as reference values for comparison with 
open burning site emission data.
Statistical Analysis
The ratios between cumulative congener concentrations of 
PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs were analyzed for each sam-
ple. The concentration ratios can be used to understand the 
predominant formation mechanism underwent during open 
burning. Further congener specific contributions to total 
TEQ in samples were calculated and plotted using Micro-
soft Excel 2019. A correlation matrix was also generated 
to understand the interdependence between the detection 
frequencies of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs congeners in burned 
residue and air samples. Further, a ground-truthing attempt 
was also been conducted by estimating the correlations of 
congener fingerprint obtained from the present study with 
respect to the simulated open burning studies reported previ-
ously in the region.
Exposure Assessment and Risk Prediction
The emission levels observed in ambient air and residual 
ash samples were utilized for assessing the risk associated 
(non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic) with two direct routes 
of human exposure—inhalation and dermal pathways. The 
daily intake doses of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs through these 
two routes were calculated for two age categories—children 
(1–17 years of age) and adults (18–70 years of age). The 
Daily Exposure Dose through inhalation and dermal (DED-
inh and DEDder—mg ­kg−1 ­day−1) were calculated as per the 
Eqs. 1 and 2, following ATSDR Public health Assessment 
Guidance Manual (ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guid-
ance Manual 2005).

total soil adhered (mg) AF—bioavailability factor (unitless), 
CF—conversion factor ­(10–6), BW—average body weight 
(kg), AT—Average lifetime (days). Table 1 gives the values 
considered for the calculation of daily exposure dose (DED), 
hazard quotients and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) 
values. The average body weight and lifetime assigned to the 
Indian population was taken for calculations, whereas total 
soil adhered was considered as per the ATSDR document as 
no nation-specific data was available.
Hazard Quotient (HQ), the ratio of daily exposure dose to 
reference dose is used for the non-carcinogenic risk assess-
ment and is calculated as per Eqs. 3 and 4. The threshold value 
of HQ is 1, where HQ < 1 indicates lower exposure than no 
observed effect dose and is considered safe. For dioxin-like 
POPs, no reference doses are available to date in India and 
hence tolerable daily intake levels recommended by WHO for 
the ingestion route (TDI—1–4 pgTEQ/kg of body weight per 
day) was adopted (WHO 1998). HI—Hazard Index represents 
the cumulative effect of the HQs arising from various chemi-
cals through different exposure pathways and in the present 
case it was calculated by summing the HQs emanating from 
dermal and inhalation route of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs (Eq. 5).

The cancer risk for the whole life exposure was deter-
mined through Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) for 
both dermal and inhalation pathways as per the methodol-
ogy specified by USEPA. An upper bound estimate of the 
response per unit chemical intake defined as the cancer slope 
factor (SF) was used for calculating ILCR (Eq. 6) through 
the dermal route. In the case of inhalation risk, IUR—inha-
lation unit risk factor was used to assess the cancer potency 
factor using the Eq. 7. ILCR was determined for both PCDD/
Fs and dl-PCBs and cumulative risk was calculated by the 
summation of dermal and inhalation risks posed by PCDD/
Fs and dl-PCBs, respectively (Eq. 8).
The carcinogenic benchmark described by USEPA was 
used for comparing the derived incremental lifetime cancer 
risk (ILCR) values. The ILCR values are classified as val-
ues ≤ 1 × ­10−6 correspond to very low, 1 × ­10−6 to 1 × ­10−4 
are low; 1 × ­10−4 to 1 × ­10−3 are moderate; 1 × ­10−3 to 
1 × ­10−1 are high and values > 1 × ­10−1 represent very high 
risk (ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual 
2005).
Results and Discussion
Dioxin Levels Observed During Street Waste Burning
Table 2 shows the PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs levels in the ambi-
ent air and burned residue samples collected from street 
waste burning sites. The ambient air volume collected was 
in the range of 302–360 ­m3 with sampling durations varying 
from 24 to 30 h. The observed levels of particulate mat-
ter ranged from 316 to 1311 µg/m3 at these sites. Levels 
of PCDD/Fs observed in air and burned residue samples 
were found to be in the range of 13.0–41.4 pg TEQ/m3 and 
369–860 ng TEQ/kg, while that of dl-PCBs varied from 0.2 
to 2.3 pg TEQ/m3 and 11.9 to 46.2 ng TEQ/kg, respectively.

were found to be 65–200 times higher than the control site 
and 10–32 times higher than the field blank values (Table 2). 
All the 17 PCDD/F congeners and 12 dl-PCB congeners 
were detected above the LOQs. The findings indicate that 
such kind of low intensity, high-frequency open burning 
incidents may contribute significantly to the total annual 
dioxin emission.
The congener wise contribution of PCDD/Fs and dl-
PCBs towards total toxicity equivalence (TEQ) are shown 
in Fig. 2a and b and the congener profiles observed in the 
samples with standard error bars are shown in Figs. S1–S4. 
The predominant PCDD/F congeners found in the air and 
burned residue samples of Pettah and Thakarapparambu 
sites were 1234678-HpCDD and OCDD whereas in Attaku-
langara the pattern observed in the air indicates a higher 
proportion of 2378-TCDF and 12378-PeCDF and in resi-
due samples, 1234678-HpCDF and OCDD were the major 
congeners. PCB-114 and PCB-118 were the major dl-PCB 
congeners in the air samples from Thakarapparambu and 
Attakulangara whereas PCB-114 and PCB-123 were the 
dominant congeners in ambient air sampled at Pettah site. 
In the case of burned residue samples also Thakarapparambu 
and Attakulangara showed similarity as PCB-77 and PCB-
81 being the most predominant congeners and in samples 
from Pettah PCB-77 and PCB-105 were the prominent ones. 
The congener profiles observed in ambient air as well as in 
burned residue do not exhibit a uniform abundance pattern 
even at same sites. An important shortcoming associated 
with the onsite studies of dioxins emissions is the uncer-
tainty associated with the waste composition, burned mass,

combustion temperature and dilution factors (Lemieux et al. 
2000). Dl-POPs emission from uncontrolled open combus-
tion is highly dependent on these factors where even the 
emission factors generated from lab scale simulated studies 
varied over 3–4 orders of magnitude (Hedman et al. 2005; 
Wevers et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2011, Ajay et al. 2021). This 
indicates that the variations in concentrations or congener 
profiles of dl-POPs with respect to different open burning 
sites monitored in the present study could be presumably due 
to variations in combustion conditions and waste composi-
tions (Gullett et al. 2010).
Dioxins Levels Observed During Fire Breakout 
Incidents at Brahmapuram
Table 3 shows levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs observed in 
ambient air and burned residue samples collected during the 
fire breakout incidents at Brahmapuram waste dumpyard site 
in consecutive years 2019 and 2020, respectively. The aver-
age levels of PCDD/Fs observed in the air and burned resi-
due matrices during the 2019 incident were 10.3 pgTEQ/m3 
and 158.2 ngTEQ/kg whereas that of dl-PCB were found to 
be 0.3 pgTEQ/m3 and 11.7 ngTEQ/kg, respectively. And in 
the 2020 incident, the average levels of PCDD/Fs observed 
in air and burned residue matrices were 3.2 pgTEQ/m3 and 
82.1 ngTEQ/kg respectively. In the case of dl-PCBs 0.3 
pgTEQ/m3 and 7.1 ngTEQ/kg were the average concentra-
tions observed in the air and burned residue matrices. In 
2019, the fire breakout incident lasted for 4 days and 24 h of 
active fumes were sampled whereas, during the fire break-
out incident in 2020, the fire was brought under control on 
the 3rd day through watering of the waste piles and hence 
active smoke was absent for the majority of sampling dura-
tion. This could be the reason for lowered levels of PCDD/
Fs and dl-PCBs in samples from the 2020 incident. The 
observed levels at dumpyard fire breakout sites were 10–20 
folds lower than the street waste burning sites (Tables 2, 
3) and this could be due to the fact that the PUF samplers 
were placed 150–170 m away from the epicenter of fire in 
the former case when compared to 2–5 m at the latter site. 
The observed levels of PCDD/Fs in ambient air during 2019 
and 2020 incidents were 50 and 15 times higher than the 
control site levels and 8 and 2.5 times higher than the field 
blank levels.
The congener wise contribution to total PCDD/F and 
dl-PCB TEQ are shown in Fig. 3a and b and the conge-
ner profiles observed at the site with standard error bars 
are shown in Figs. S1–S4. 1,234,678-HpCDD and OCDD 
were the most prominent PCDD/F congeners in the air sam-
ples of 2019 and 2020 incidents and also in burned residue 
samples from 2019. The burned residue sample from 2020 
showed higher levels of 1,234,678-HpCDD and 1,234,678-
HpCDF. The major dl-PCB congeners in the air samples 
from 2019 and 2020 were PCB-118, PCB-114 and PCB-123 
respectively. In the case of burned residue samples PCB-
123, PCB-118, PCB-77 and PCB-123 were respectively the 
major congeners in 2019 and 2020.
Statistical Analysis and Correlation Studies
The trend of group-wise congener abundance observed in air 
samples was dl-PCBs > PCDFs > PCDDs, and in burned res-
idue samples was dl-PCBs > PCDDs > PCDFs which were 
in agreement with the findings of simulated MSW combus-
tion studies reported on Indian conditions (Ajay et al. 2021). 
Among PCDD/Fs the predominance of PCDDs over PCDFs 
was generally observed indicating the higher availability of 
oxygen due to open combustion conditions (Addink and Olie 
1995). In addition, an abundance of PCDDs and higher chlo-
rinated congeners in the majority of samples indicates that 
heterogeneous condensation of precursor molecules involv-
ing both gas and solid phase reactants was prevailing during 
open burning (Huang and Buekens 1995; Wikström et al. 
2003).

date the interrelationship between dioxins, dl-PCBs and PM

concentration exhibited a very high correlation with PCDD/
Fs air emission (ρ = 1), whereas poor correlations were 
observed with respect to dl-PCBs emissions (ρ = 0.14). This 
difference could be attributed to the antagonistic effect of 
two aspects i.e. high particulate bound nature of PCDD/F 
congeners and the relatively high volatility of dl-PCBs 
(Heo et al. 2014; Cindoruk and Tasdemir 2007). Further, 
the PCDD/Fs levels in air samples were highly correlated 
with burned residue levels, whereas a statistically signifi-
cant correlation of dl-PCBs in air and residue samples was 
hardly observed. Although PCDD/Fs levels in air samples 
was not correlated with dl-PCB levels, both the groups 
were highly correlated in residue samples similar to those 
reported elsewhere (Cortés et al. 2014; Ba et al. 2009). The 
higher affinity of PCDD/Fs towards burned residues during 
open burning conditions has been previously reported which 
could be due to the planar structure of these compounds as it 
promotes strong binding towards carbonaceous residual mat-
ter. Some reports also suggest the role of shrinkage of the 
burning surface during combustion which could restrict the 
dioxins formed at the surfaces from emitting to air (Hazard-
ous Chemicals from Open Burning of Waste in Developing 
Countries—Final Report 2010; Zhang et al. 2017). On the 
contrary, the commensurate rise of dl-PCBs levels in air 
and residue samples points to its lower particulate adsorp-
tion tendency which needs detailed investigation to eluci-
date the mechanism of congener distribution between phases 
depending on the degree of planarity of dl-PCBs (non-ortho 
& mono-ortho PCBs).
Further a comparative evaluation between the congener 
profiles observed in the present study with that of the general 
congener patterns reported from the open burning scenarios 
in the region was conducted to ensure that the emissions 
are exclusively from the MSW open burning incidents at 
the sites (Ajay et al. 2021). It could also lead to the deriva-
tion of dl-POPs congener fingerprint representative of MSW 
open burning sector in the region. The Spearman’s correla-
tion analysis to deduce the above hypothesis are shown in 
supplementary information, Tables S1–S4. It shows that the 
congener profiles of PCDD/Fs in burned residues samples 
from open burning sites reported in the present study showed 
a very high correlation with that observed in the simulated 
study. In the case of ambient air, the congener profile of 
all samples except the one from the Thakarapparambu site

exhibited a very high correlation with simulated combustion 
study profiles. An interesting finding is that even though the 
ambient air levels observed at different sites varied over two 
orders in magnitude, the congener profiles were having sta-
tistically significant correlations between them. Therefore, 
the congener profiles can be considered as a source finger-
print of open burning activities in the region. The dl-PCBs 
have not shown any notable correlations in the case of air 
samples, whereas a significant correlation was observed for 
residue samples in the present field samples vis-à-vis the 
reported congener profile of the simulated study.
Comparative Evaluation of Emission Levels 
with Previous Studies
There are no threshold levels established for dioxins in 
the ambient air or the burned residues from open burn-
ing in Indian conditions or internationally. Moreover, it is 
inappropriate to compare the permissible levels specified 
for stack emission vis-à-vis the non-point/area sources of 
emissions and hence an assessment of the extent of con-
tamination at the site cannot be derived from the observed 
air and residual level concentrations. From the literature 
survey, it was noted that only very few case studies based 
on real-time sampling during fire breakout incidents at 
waste dumpyards were reported previously and a compara-
tive evaluation of available studies is given in Table 5. 
A rapid decline in the levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs 
in ambient air with the increase in distance from the fire 
focal point was a notable observation, which was inferred 
in some of the previous studies as well (Ruokojärvi et al. 
1995; Mazzucco et al. 2020; Bergström and Björner 1992; 
Rada et al. 2018; Fajkovic et al. 2018; Weichenthal et al. 
2015; Nadal et al. 2016a, b). Ruokojärvi’s and Bergström’s 
groups conducted sampling at 2–10 m away from the 
fire focal point and the levels observed are comparable 
with the present study. The predicted concentrations of 
54.6–76.9 pgTEQ/m3 through modelling study by Rada 
et al. is very much similar to the current findings consid-
ering the possible dilution effects that may incur at the 
sites. On the contrary, Mazzucco et al. reported a high 
level of dioxin deposition in the soil at 1–3 km apart from 
the Bellolampo fire accident site in Italy whereas Nadal 
et al. reported much lower emission levels from tyre land-
fill fires in Spain at a similar distance. This indicates that 
the comparative evaluation needs to address different 
aspects such as waste quantity, type of waste, duration of 
the incident, micro-meteorological factors and the applied 
sampling and analytical methods to understand the trends 
of emission.

Health Risk Assessment
The non-carcinogenic, as well as carcinogenic risks asso-
ciated with the dermal and inhalation exposures for the 
exposed community were estimated for all the sites. Approx-
imately 1–5 fire breakout incidents occur annually at Brah-
mapuram waste dumpyard site and considering the average 
atmospheric lifetime of dioxins as 26–130 h (approximately 
5–6 days), 30 days per year was considered as the exposure 
frequency (Atkinson 1991). The plant was commissioned 
in 2008 and the first fire breakout incident in the plant was 
reported in April 2010 and hence 10 years was considered 
as the exposure duration. In the case of open burning of 
street waste, the major centralized waste treatment facil-
ity in Thiruvananthapuram city was closed down in 2013. 
Since then, the frequency of road dumps and street waste 
burning incidents increased quite evidently and hence the 
subsequent 8 years was considered as the exposure duration. 
It was noted from surveillance studies that open burning of 
wastes is practiced at least once in every 2–3 days in the 
street sites of Thiruvananthapuram city. As per the ATSDR 
guidelines, the upper bound frequency of incidents needs 
to be considered for risk calculation. Thus 180 days per 
annum was taken as the exposure frequency for calculating 
the health risk assessment.
Daily Exposure Dose
Table 6 shows the estimated (daily exposure doses) DEDs 
through dermal and inhalation routes at the study sites. The 
PCDD/Fs dermal DEDs for children varied from 7.6 × ­10–12 
to 1.3 × ­10–10 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 and for adults, it var-
ied from 1.8 × ­10–12 to 3 × ­10–11 mgTEQ ­kg–1 bw ­day–1. The 
DEDs of PCDD/Fs from inhalation ranged from 4.8 × ­10–11 
to 4.5 × ­10–9 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 for children and 
1.1 × ­10–11 to 1.0 × ­10–9 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 for adults. 
In both routes, children were found to be more susceptible 
to the exposures of dioxins than adults. From Table 6 it can 
be noted that the cumulative exposure doses were up to 70 
times higher at street burning sites than the fire breakout 
incident site. A similar trend was found in the case of dl-
PCB daily exposure doses. The dermal doses of dl-PCBs 
varied from 6.6 × ­10–13 to 7.2 × ­10–12 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 
for children and 1.6 × ­10–13 to 1.7 × ­10–12 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw 
­day−1 for adults. Whereas the inhalation doses varied from 
4.6 × ­10–12 to 1.7 × ­10–10 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 for children 
and from 1.0 × ­10–12 to 3.8 × ­10–11 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 
for adults. When compared between the exposure pathways, 
inhalation exposure doses were higher for both the age 
groups whereas comparison between the congener groups 
revealed that PCDD/Fs dose levels were approximately 30 
times higher than that of dl-PCBs (Table 6).
Non‑carcinogenic Risk: Hazard Quotient and Hazard 
Index
The non-carcinogenic risk estimates of PCDD/F/dl-PCBs from 
dermal and inhalation routes for children and adults are shown 
in Fig. 4a and b. The HQs for dermal risk was found to be 
very low in the range of 4 × ­10–3 to 1 × ­10–2 for children and 
5 × ­10–4 to 3 × ­10–3 for adults. Whereas the inhalation risk HQ 
was found to be 10–100 times higher than the dermal risk i.e. 
1.0–1.1 × ­10–2 for children and 3 × ­10–3 to 3 × ­10–1 for adults. 
Children were having higher HQ values in both the routes and 
can be considered as the higher risk community. In the case of 
dl-PCBs also a similar trend was observed where HQs calcu-
lated for inhalation route was higher than that of dermal by a 
factor of 10–100. Inhalation risk HQs for children and adults 
were in the range of 1 × ­10–3 to 4 × ­10–2 and 3 × ­10–4 to 1 × ­10–2 
respectively. Whereas dermal risk HQs ranged from 2 × ­10–4 
to 2 × ­10–3 for children and 4 × ­10–5 to 4 × ­10–4 for adults. A 
cumulative non-carcinogenic risk index (HI) from dermal and 
inhalation exposure to PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was also calcu-
lated (Fig. 4a, b). Hazard quotients from dermal exposures at 
all the sites were having a very low contribution to HI rang-
ing from 2 to 13% for children and 2–14% for adults. Hazard 
indices at street burning sites were approximately up to 80 
times higher than that at dumpyard fire site and the highest 
HI for children (1.2) was at Thakarapparambu which crossed 
the threshold value of 1. At Attakulangara where the HI was

found to be 0.7 also point towards significant non-carcinogenic 
effects to children underexposure. The highest HI for adults 
(0.3) was at Thakarapparambu which was much lower than 
the reference limit value indicating very low non-carcinogenic 
risk. The probability of non-carcinogenic risk arising from 
PCDD/Fs exposure during open burning is much higher than 
the dl-PCBs, as 90–99% of the cumulative hazard indices were 
contributed by PCDD/Fs.
Carcinogenic Risk: Incremental Life Cancer Risk 
(ILCR)
Probabilistic cancer risk was estimated which is a depic-
tion of the number of people in a million equally exposed 
persons to develop cancer or cancer-linked illnesses 
over a lifetime (Fig. 5). The cancer risk from the der-
mal exposure of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were found in 
the range of 3 × ­10–7 to 5 × ­10–6 whereas the inhalation 
exposure ranged from 2 × ­10–6 to 2 × ­10–4. Hence, dermal 
exposure is accountable for only low to very low cancer 
risks, while that associated with inhalation was found to 
be in the moderate to low range. The highest ILCR val-
ues through inhalation and dermal exposure were found 
at Thakarapparambu and Pettah respectively. The trends 
of carcinogenic risks arising from exposure to PCDDs 
were found to be 10–100 times higher than dl-PCBs. The 
ILCRs values of both PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs through der-
mal and inhalation pathways were summed together to

get the cumulative incremental lifetime cancer risk. The 
cumulative risk values ranged from 2 × ­10–6 to 2 × ­10–4 
which indicates moderate to low risk to exposed indi-
viduals. As per USEPA, ILCR values lower than 1 × ­10–6 
indicates the probability of no additional cancer risk to 
the exposed community whereas ILCRs in the range of 
1 × ­10–6 to 1 × ­10–4 indicate a moderate threat. The ILCR 
values higher than 1 × ­10–4 suggests ‘unacceptable’ expo-
sure conditions as per the ATSDR guidance manual and 
is likely to cause excess cancer risk to the community. 
At two of the street waste burning sites viz. Attakulan-
gara and Thakarapparambu the ILCRs were higher than 
1 × ­10–4 and in all the other sites values were in the range 
of 1 × ­10–6 to 1 × ­10–4. This indicates a moderate to unac-
ceptable level of cancer risk exists at all the sites and 
requires in-depth studies such as long-term sampling pro-
grams and bio-monitoring studies for the further evalua-
tion of the scenario.
Comparison of Carcinogenic Risk Assessment 
Studies
Assessment of cancer risk posed by dl-POPs from street 
waste burning based on real-time sampling studies was 
not available in the literature and hence, the findings of 
the present investigation were compared with a few studies 
which reported risk factors associated with MSW landfills 
(Table 7). The risk factors estimated in the present study 
was higher than most of the reported ones, as it reported 
the exposure risk based on the real-time sampling studies 
conducted during fire breakout incidents or street open burn-
ing activities whereas the former ones estimated risk in the 
vicinity of waste landfills from random sampling. A study 
conducted in Kenya on the risk assessment from open burn-
ing of MSW reported higher carcinogenic risk values and 
comparable non-carcinogenic risk with the present study 
(Shih et al. 2016). Another study on the risk factors asso-
ciated with PCDD/Fs emission in a 3 km buffer zone of a 
non-hazardous waste landfill area reported the possibility

of very low risk to the exposed community (Davoli et al. 
2010). Similarly, few other studies on the impact of hazard-
ous waste landfill sites to the nearby population reported 
lower ranges of risk factors (Palmiotto et al. 2014; Nadal 
et al. 2016a, b). ILCR reported at the street waste burning 
sites in the present study is the highest as per the compari-
son table (although the ingestion route is not included in 
the present study) and this is essentially due to the greater 
frequency of incidents and the possibility of lower radial 
dispersion of emitted dl-POPs.
Conclusions
The present study evaluated dl-POPs emissions from uncon-
trolled open burning of MSW and associated carcinogenic 
and non-carcinogenic risks through two pathways at selected 
streets and dumpyard sites in Kerala, India. The correla-
tion studies elucidated the possibility of deriving congener 
‘fingerprints’ for MSW open burning and points towards 
developing smart tools for source identification. The chil-
dren were found to be susceptible to the non-carcinogenic 
effects at one site whereas adults were found to be in safe 
limits with comparatively lower hazard indices. The cumu-
lative ILCR factors at the sites were in the range of 2 × ­10–6 
to 2 × ­10–4 which is classified as low to moderate risk as 
per ATSDR guidelines. The major pathway of exposure was 
through inhalation (more than 90%) and PCDD/Fs accounted 
for 90% of the cumulative risk. The street waste littering and 
burning were found to pose more threats to human health 
than dumpyard fires due to their episodic nature, higher 
exposure probability (closeness to settlements and public 
places) and ground-level emissions resulting in minimum 
dispersive dilutions.

The practice of household bush burning in Grenada occurs frequently, though it is not well documented. The effects of the
emissions from bush burning on respiratory health of the population have never been researched in Grenada. The goal of the
study was to measure the frequency of bush burning and to investigate the relationship between bush burning practice and
respiratory health in Grenada. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was used to gather information from households in
the parishes of St. George and St. Andrew, Grenada. In total, 225 participants were recruited and their responses on household
bush burning and respiratory symptoms were analyzed. Self-reported data showed that the practice of bush burning was
conducted by 43% (n = 96) of the participants as a regular practice (every month) and 86% (n = 192) of participants stated
that their neighbors burn bush regularly. The most common lower respiratory symptom associated with bush burning was dry
cough (31.4%). The participants who engage in the practice of bush burning had a statistically signiﬁcant, higher prevalence of
sinusitis symptoms (OR: 2.1, CI 95%: 1.1–3.9) and had slightly higher prevalence of cough (OR: 1.6, CI 95%: 0.9–2.8).
Prevalences of physician-diagnosed asthma and sinusitis were 12.3% and 31.2%, respectively. Conducting studies on the health
effects of bush burning in different settings and with different practices, such as the household bush burning in our current study,
could help to improve public health in the developing world.
Implications:
Household disposal of waste is a signiﬁcant issue in the developing world. In particular, residential bush
burning is a common practice in tropical regions. This study demonstrates that the common practice of bush burning in the
Caribbean is associated with respiratory symptoms and demonstrates the need for better management of residential yard waste.
Burning of yard waste results in potentially signiﬁcant exposures to air pollution and therefore alternative disposal practices need
to be available. There is a need to increase awareness of the importance of avoiding exposure to the air pollutants generated
during bush burning among communities in the Caribbean.
Introduction
Bush burning is a chemical process that involves the break-
down of plant material into ash and other organic matter. This
process is widely utilized in developing countries in an effort to
clear lands for cultivation and for removal of dry vegetation,
creating an open space that can be used for crops, and tends to
be more widespread in the tropics (Cançado et al., 2006). The
practice of bush burning plays a supporting role in contributing to
the problem of outdoor pollution in the environment. Smoke
particles emitted from this process contain small particles with
aerodynamic diameters that are generally signiﬁcantly less than
2.5 µm (Wardoyoa et al., 2007; Haywood et al., 2003). Speciﬁc
chemical and physical characteristics of these particles are sig-
niﬁcantly impacted by the particular conditions under which
burning occurs, which can be highly variable in wildﬁre and
agricultural burning (Wardoyoa et al., 2007; Hays et al., 2002).
The chemical constituents of this particulate matter are also
diverse and have been evaluated and found to include elemental
carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxalate, C31
n-alkane, levoglucosan, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC),
oleic acid, K, Zn, Cl, Na, NO3, V, Pb, Cr, Cd, and Na (Estrellan
and Iino, 2010; Lara et al., 2005). It has long been suspected that
plant-based material, through either combustion or other pro-
cesses, may serve as one source of ﬁne particle organics in the
atmosphere (Blando et al., 1998). A host of gases have also been
associated with burning of agricultural waste, including CO2,
CO, CH4, N2O, NOx, nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC)
(Estrellan and Iino, 2010; California Ofﬁce of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment, 2008), and volatile and semivolatile
organic compounds (Lemieux et al., 2004). The ﬁne particles
have been shown to penetrate deep into the lower respiratory
system through the lungs and to pose a threat to the health of

those affected (American Thoracic Society & Committee of the
Environmental and Occupational Health, 1996). The identiﬁed
gases are also associated with adverse health endpoints, including
those listed as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) under the U.S.
Clean Air Act (EPA, 2014).
Household bush burning is a part of a more general practice
known as backyard burning or barrel burning. This process,
according to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA,
2013), refers to burning of household trash by residents at their
own property. This trash can include cardboard, plastics, yard
trimmings, paper and many other materials and is a very common
disposal method used in many developing countries (Solorzano-
Ochoa et al., 2012). The emissions from the combustion process
are freely released directly into the atmosphere without treatment
or ﬁltration to remove particulate matter. These emissions are also
highly variable, depending the conditions under which burning
takes place (Solorzano-Ochoa et al., 2012). The burning of waste
is harmful to both human health and the environment. According
to the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2013), emis-
sions from this process can aggravate respiratory disease, such as
asthma, and can increase the risk of heart disease. The process can
also produce a group of highly toxic chemicals known as dioxins
(Lemieux et al., 2000), which can then settle on crops or deposit in
waterways and affect the health of those who would ingest con-
taminated crops or water.
Worldwide, 8% of noncommunicable disease mortalities are
made up by chronic respiratory disease, which is signiﬁcant
(World Health Organization [WHO], 2011b). The most common
among them are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), which account for 235 million and 50 million cases
worldwide, respectively (WHO, 2011a). Both of these diseases
are shown to be increasing worldwide, and asthma can be linked
to an estimated 250,000 deaths annually (WHO, 2007). According
to the World Health Organization (WHO), around the world,
hundreds of millions of persons suffer from chronic respiratory
diseases, many of which are preventable (WHO, 2007). A signiﬁ-
cant point to consider with these diseases is that indoor and outdoor
air pollution is a major risk factor in their development.
Bush burning can be carried out by a range of different
individuals, including regular homeowners, farmers, and busi-
nesses, as often as they deem necessary, with only an unen-
forced warning for reduction of the practice in the dry seasons
in Grenada. Statistics from the Fire Department Headquarters
of Grenada show that 478 major bush ﬁres alone were reported
in 2010, which were mainly due to the spread of unregulated
household bush ﬁres. The association between household bush
burning and its effect on respiratory health is a concern not
previously researched in Grenada or in the Caribbean. This
study aims to discover how prevalent the burning of bush is
by persons residing in Grenada, and to investigate the relation-
ship between bush burning practice and respiratory symptoms.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, trained personnel collected
information using a standardized questionnaire from house-
holds in the parishes of St. George, which is a nonrural area,
and St. Andrew, which is rural, in Grenada. Ethical approval
was obtained from the institutional review board of St.
George’s University in Grenada.
The sample population was chosen using the Grenada cen-
sus data by using multistage cluster sampling. The calculated
sample size, including household members 18 years and older,
was in total 281 participants from the parishes of St. George
(nonrural) and St. Andrew (rural), Grenada (conﬁdence interval
= 0.95, margin of error = 0.05, assumed proportion = 0.5). The
sample size calculation included an additional 15% reserve
population to address any plausible loss of sample population.
WHO recommended Kish methodology was used for the
household participant selection (Kish, 1995).
Respiratory health questions were developed based on exist-
ing validated standard questionnaires by the American Thoracic
Society, Respiratory Diseases Questionnaire (Ferris, 1978). The
questionnaire was pretested through a pilot study in a different
community in Grenada. The questionnaire included questions
on demographics, bush burning practice, airway symptoms,
physician-diagnosed diseases, environmental health-related his-
tory, and smoking status and was administered to participants
at their home. Data were collected on the upper and lower
respiratory symptoms suffered by the participants within the
last 12 months, as well as the symptoms they may have
experienced during or after their exposure to the smoke emis-
sions from the burning of bush. Questions about sinusitis
included symptoms such as drainage of a discharge, dry throat,
and pain or tenderness around face or forehead.
Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software
package version 18.0. Descriptive and analytical analyses were
done based on the type of data collected. Chi-squared and
unconditional logistic regression models were used to analyze
the data. In our preliminary analysis, we included sex, age, and
smoking in the model. However, we did not observe any
associations with these factors.
Results
In total, 225 participants completed the questionnaire from
households in St. George and St. Andrew parishes, with a
participation rate of 80.1%. Participants were mostly female
(55.1%) and nonsmokers (85.3%), with a mean age of 38.9 ±
8.1 years. According to the participant demographics, there
was no statistical difference between the two parishes. The
practice of bush burning occurred in 43% (n = 96) of the
households regularly every month. Twenty-eight (29.17%) par-
ticipants who practice bush burning burned twice a month and
the rest of them burned once a month. The nonrural parish of
St. George accounted for 38 of 96 households (40%) that
practice bush burning. One hundred ninety-two participants
(86%) stated that their neighbors burn bush regularly, with
47% (90/192) of them from St. George parish (nonrural).
Analysis revealed that 12.3% of those who practice bush
burning reported that they would also burn trash on their
property but this was only done rarely. The local waste autho-
rities collected garbage from 99.0% of these participants at
least once per week.

Table 1 shows the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among
the overall participants and associated odds ratios. The odds ratios
were computed as those who stated they burn bush versus those
who stated that they do not burn bush. The most common lower
respiratory symptom over the past 12 months was dry cough
(31.4%). The most common upper respiratory symptoms over
the past 12 months were sneezing (44.3%) and runny nose
(33.1%). The participants who engaged in bush burning had a
statistically signiﬁcant higher prevalence of sinusitis symptoms.
(OR: 2.1, CI 95%: 1.1–3.9) and had a slightly higher prevalence
of cough (OR: 1.5, CI 95%: 0.9–2.8). Prevalences of physician-
diagnosed asthma and sinusitis were 12.3% (n = 27) and 31.2%
(n = 69), respectively. The participants who did practice bush
burning had a slightly high prevalence of physician-diagnosed
sinusitis (OR: 1.4, CI 95%: 0.8–2.5) and prevalence of physician-
diagnosed asthma (OR: 1.3, CI 95%: 0.7–2.8).
A statistically signiﬁcant relationship exists between the
participants’ location and the nasal symptoms. Persons from
St. George (nonrural) have higher prevalence of runny nose
than persons from St. Andrew (rural) during or after bush
burning (OR: 2.5, CI 95%: 1.3–4.9). Respondents from St.
George (nonrural) also have higher prevalence of asthma-like
symptoms than persons from St. Andrew (rural) during or after
bush burning (OR: 1.8, CI 95%: 1.1–2.6).
Discussion
In this study, we measured the frequency of bush burning
practice and investigated the relationship between bush burning
practice and respiratory health in Grenada. Although the local
waste authorities regularly collected garbage, household bush
burning is still a common practice in Grenada and occurs
throughout the entire year.
In our study, we noticed that the participants who engaged
in the practice of bush burning had a slightly higher prevalence
of cough and physician-diagnosed asthma. However, we did
not observe a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between bush
burning and lower respiratory symptoms. This result may have
been due to the fact that persons who are sick with lower
respiratory symptoms do not want to participate in bush burn-
ing and the fact that there are many different factors that may
contribute to the risk of lower respiratory symptoms. There is
potential exposure misclassiﬁcation, especially those who do
not burn but are still exposed to air pollutants from neighbors’
burning. As a result, it is possible that we were not able to
detect a statistically signiﬁcant relationship through calculation
of the odds ratios for lower respiratory symptoms. This would
be particularly true if survey participants also did not under-
stand how to categorize or identify symptoms such as “wheez-
ing.” Survey participants may have inaccurately reported their
lower airway symptoms, resulting in further misclassiﬁcation
bias. Misclassiﬁcation bias often makes detection through the
computation of odds ratios more difﬁcult and may explain the
lack of statistical signiﬁcance among those measures. For this
reason, the relationship between bush burning and their respira-
tory symptoms could not be fully captured. Previous studies
have found associations between burning of plant material and
increased risk of asthma and respiratory related symptoms. A
study conducted by Jacobs et al. analyzing the health impact of
the burning of planted rice ﬁelds in California found that the
risk for daily asthma related hospitalizations increased per acre

of rice that was burned (Jacobs et al., 1997). Another study
conducted by Jose et al. in Piracicaba, Brazil, found the
respiratory status of the region’s inhabitants was most at risk
during the months where sugar-cane burning occurred, due to
the related release of particulate matter (Cançado, 2006). These
periods would last at least 6 months and cause chronic expo-
sure. In yet another Brazilian city, Araraquara, Arbex et al.
similarly found that increased total suspended particles in the
air from the burning of sugar cane burning was signiﬁcantly
associated with hospital admissions of asthma related cases
(Arbex et al., 2007). These studies were however conducted
where burning was done on a larger scale and for longer
periods of time. However, in our study, bush burning was
done by the participants for disposing of cuttings from the
area around their homes, which is on a smaller scale. This
reduces the total amount of particulate matter released into
the immediate surrounding atmosphere and may reduce the
duration of exposure.
In our study, we observed a statistically signiﬁcant higher
prevalence of sinusitis symptoms among the bush burner group.
We also noticed that the prevalence of physician-diagnosed sinu-
sitis was high (31.2%), and the participants who engaged in the
practice of bush burning had a slightly higher prevalence of
physician-diagnosed sinusitis. There was not related to demo-
graphic characteristics of the survey participants. Previous studies
addressed overall respiratory health effects of biomass burning;
however, there is no speciﬁc study on the relationship between
sinusitis and bush burning practice. As we stated in one of our
previous studies, some of the most underestimated and least
known respiratory problems related to environmental exposures
are upper airways diseases, including sinusitis, which can cause
systemic symptoms and decrease quality of life (Akpinar-Elci
et al., 2011). Therefore, this study, which showed the link between
sinusitis symptoms and the practice of bush burning, might be
helpful in understanding early detection and appropriate manage-
ment of upper airway diseases related to environmental exposure
and preventing other conditions, such as asthma.
We also observed a statistically signiﬁcant relationship
between the participants’ location and some of the respiratory
symptoms during or after bush burning. Respondents from St.
George, which is a nonrural setting, had a higher prevalence of
nasal symptoms and asthma-like symptoms during or after the
bush burning practice. The parish of St. George is the most
densely populated parish in Grenada, which was thought to
have increased the probability of individual exposure to bush
burning emissions and increase respiratory symptoms.
A major limitation exists in that this study relied upon the
cross-sectional design and participant-reported data, which
may have been prone to recall bias. This bias may have been
further ampliﬁed due to the length of time between the burn-
ings and/or the lack of severity of symptoms. As this was a
cross-sectional study, we also did not have data on the expo-
sure history of survey participants. The interaction of smoking
with bush burning on symptoms could also not be fully
assessed because the majority of our survey participants did
not smoke and we had low statistical power, which may
explain the lack of any statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings between
comparisons of smokers and nonsmokers. Another potential
limitation of the study may have been due to the fact that
persons who are sick with respiratory symptoms may be too
unwell to participate in bush burning. In addition, the inter-
pretation of the results is also limited by the lack of air pollu-
tion measurements collected during burning. At the time of this
study, there were no available personnel on the island with the
skills and resources necessary to measure air pollutants. As
such, differences and variation in exposure among survey
participants could not be assessed beyond broad generaliza-
tions about whether the survey participate burned bush or did
not burn bush. In addition, this practice is extremely wide-
spread in the island, and as a result all residents, even those
who don’t burn themselves, are likely exposed to some air
pollution from bush burning by neighbors. As such, it is not
possible to categorize survey participants as “not exposed” and
“exposed” since all survey respondents likely had some expo-
sure, which could contribute to misclassiﬁcation bias in the
computation of odds ratios. For these reasons, the relationship
between bush burning and their respiratory symptoms could
not be fully captured. Strengths of the study included the high
participation rate and the random sampling strategy. Thus, we
believed that the result of the study represented the proﬁle of
Grenada, including rural and nonrural settings. According to
our knowledge, there are no studies in the small-scale house-
hold bush burning and respiratory problems from developing
world. Readers need to keep in mind that geographical remote-
ness and limited infrastructure are a challenge during the data
collection process in a developing country setting such as
Grenada. Therefore, we believe that the result of our study
could be invaluable to inform the scientiﬁc communities.
The health effects of biomass smoke exposure has been
extensively studied, relating to residential exposure to wood-
stoves or cook stoves as indoor exposure, or community-wide
exposure from wild ﬁres or agricultural burning. However,
there are not enough studies about the health effects of the
household bush burning practice, which is smaller scale and
constant. Therefore, conducting health effects of biomass stu-
dies in different settings and using different practices, such as
the household bush burning practice in our current study, could
help to improve public health in the developing world.

Abstract
Background: Effect of indoor air pollution (IAP) on birth weight remains largely unexplored but yet purported as
the most important environmental exposure for pregnant women in developing countries due to the effects of
second-hand smoke. We investigated the associations between the determinants of indoor air quality in
households and birth weight.
Methods: A cross-sectional study of 592 mothers and their newborns using postnatal services at the Korle Bu
Teaching Hospital located in Accra, Ghana was conducted in 2010 to collect information on characteristics of
indoor environment and other potential determinants of fetal growth. Birth weight was recorded from hospital
records.
Results: Household cooking fuel choices and garbage burning practices were determinants of birth weight.
Multivariate linear regression analysis adjusting for age, social class, marital status and gravidity of mothers, and sex
of neonate resulted in a 243g (95% CI: 496, 11) and 178g (95% CI: 421, 65) reduction in birth weight for use of
charcoal, and garbage burning respectively compared with use of LPG only. The estimated reductions in birth
weight was not statistically significant. Applying the ordinal scale exposure parameter nonetheless revealed a
significant exposure-response relationship between maternal exposures from charcoal use and garbage burning,
and birth weight. Generalized linear models adjusting for confounders resulted in a 41% (risk ratio [RR] = 1.41; 95%
CI: 0.62, 3.23) and 195% (RR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.10, 7.92) increase in the risk of low birth weight (LBW) for use of
charcoal, and garbage burning respectively compared with use of LPG only. A combination of charcoal use and
household garbage burning during pregnancy on fetal growth resulted in a 429g (95% CI: 259, 599) reduction in
birth weight and 316% (RR=4.16; 95% CI: 2.02, 8.59) excess risk of LBW. Sensitivity analysis performed by restricting
the analysis to term births produced similar results.
Conclusions: Maternal use of charcoal as a cooking fuel during pregnancy and burning of garbage at home are
strong determinants of average fetal growth and risk of LBW. Efforts to reduce maternal exposures to IAP are thus
important to improve birth outcomes.

Background
Birth weight is an important determinant and predictor
of neonatal and infantile growth and survival, as well as
health in childhood and later life. Low birth weight
(LBW), defined by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as birth weight less than 2500 grams [1] is
closely associated with neonatal and infant mortality and
morbidity, reduced growth, impaired immune function
and poor cognitive development [2]. LBW has also been
associated with childhood and adult disorders such as
asthma [3], type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary
heart disease in many studies [4,5].
Birth weight is determined by multiple factors with
Sohl and Moore [6] estimating heredity and environmen-
tal factors to account for 40% and 60% of birth weight re-
spectively.
Stephenson
and
Symonds
[7]
have
also
suggested that about 60% of the variation in birth weight
can be explained by environmental factors. Environmen-
tal factors are therefore clearly important determinants
of birth weight. Spencer and Logan [8] note that secular
changes in birth weight, birth weight variations within
genetically similar populations, and birth weight depic-
tion of a reverse social gradient such that increasing dis-
advantage is associated with decreasing birth weight all
suggest an environmental influence.
The maternal household environment has been proposed
to have a strong influence on birth weight. Stephenson and
Symonds [7] identified the general and immediate maternal
environment to account for almost 40% of the variation in
birth weight attributable to environmental factors. Cooking
fuels such as charcoal and wood, and garbage burning are
important sources of indoor air pollution in maternal
households with poor ventilation of homes often worsening
indoor air pollution. The relationship between indoor air
pollution (IAP) and birth weight remains largely unexplored
with studies in Guatemala [9,10], Zimbabwe [11], Pakistan
[12] and India [13,14] that reported association of biomass
fuel use with reduced and low birth weight identified to be
the only studies to have examined this relationship.
The apparent lack of research on the link between indoor
air pollution and birth weight is totally at variance with the
widespread projection of indoor air pollution as the most
important environmental exposure for pregnant women es-
pecially in developing countries due to the effects of
second-hand smoke. It is against this background that our
objective was to study the associations between the deter-
minants of indoor air quality such as cooking fuel choices,
cooking sequence and patterns, and household garbage
burning practices, and birth weight in Accra households.
Methods
Study design and site
A cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers
and newborns of the Maternity Department of the Korle
Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH). KBTH is located in the
south-western part of Accra and serves as the national
referral centre for southern Ghana. The catchment area
of KBTH's Maternity Department are communities in
the south-western corridor of Accra. The comprehensive
and specialist services on offer at KBTH as a whole sees
majority of mothers residing in the south-western part
of Accra preferring this facility to others in the area that
equally provides Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)
services. Mothers from other parts of Accra and sur-
rounding areas also access RCH services at KBTH for
the very same reason or because they have been referred
for an underlying health risk.
Study population and sampling procedure
The source population comprised all nursing mothers
residing in Accra. Six hundred and forty seven mothers
that had singleton deliveries with no gross anatomical de-
formities at KBTH Maternity Department and accessing
postnatal services at the same facility were randomly
sampled from a shortlist provided by the department's
Biostatistics Unit. Selected mothers who visited the post-
natal clinic were interviewed after verification that they
were non- referral patients, and resided in Accra and
their respective neighbourhood throughout the duration
of the pregnancy. The study population included 592
newborns (response rate 91.5%).
Exposure assessment
We studied the independent and joint effects of charcoal
usage and garbage burning on fetal growth. Exposure in-
formation was collected by using a structured question-
naire to obtain information on the type of cooking fuel
used, type and ventilation rating of cooking enclosure,
frequency and duration of cooking activities, amount of
time spent in cooking area during cooking sessions,
practice of garbage burning in household, frequency of
garbage burning, and presence of mother during garbage
burning sessions.
Households using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) only
without charcoal or garbage burning constituted the
reference category. The two main household fuel types
were used alone and in combination. To study the inde-
pendent and joint effects of these together with garbage
burning we used the following exposure categories: (1)
charcoal use only, (2) charcoal and LPG use, (3) garbage
burning only, (4) both LPG use and garbage burning,
and (5) both charcoal use and garbage burning. For
charcoal and garbage burning we also used ordinal scale
exposure parameter: low, moderate and high.
The level of exposure to charcoal and garbage burning
was defined as follows. For use of charcoal only, step
one involved (a) classifying the following as high expos-
ure practices: cooking up to the seventh or ninth month
Amegah et al. Environmental Health 2012, 11:78

of pregnancy, cooking frequency of four or more times
per week, staying in cooking area throughout the whole
duration of each cooking session, and cooking area ven-
tilation ratings of poor or satisfactory, and (b) classifying
the following as low exposure practices: cooking up to
the sixth month of pregnancy, cooking frequency of less
than four times per week, staying in cooking area for up
to about half the duration of each cooking session, and
cooking area ventilation ratings of good, very good or
excellent. Step two involved (a) classifying maternal re-
port of all four high exposure practices or a combination
of any three high exposure practices and any one low ex-
posure practice as high exposure; (b) classifying mater-
nal report of a combination of any two high exposure
practices and any two low exposure practices as moder-
ate exposure, and (c) classifying maternal report of all
four low exposure practices or a combination of any
three low exposure practices and any one high exposure
practices as low exposure.
With regards to garbage burning only, step one
involved (a) classifying the following as high exposure
practices: garbage burning frequency of four or more
times per week, and regular presence in household dur-
ing combustion, and (b) classifying the following as low
exposure practices: garbage burning frequency of less
than four times per week, and occasional presence in
household during combustion. Step two involved (a)
classifying maternal report of the two high exposure
practices as high exposure, (b) classifying maternal re-
port of a combination of any one high exposure practice
and any one low exposure practice as moderate expos-
ure, and (c) classifying maternal report of the two low
exposure practices as low exposure.
Outcomes
The main outcome was fetal growth which was mea-
sured both as birth weight in grams and low birth weight
(birth weight below 2500 grams). Birth weight of the
newborns was obtained from hospital records. An RGZ-
20 baby scale which measures birth weight in kilograms
up to two decimal places was used at the facility to
weigh newborns immediately after birth. The scale was
regularly calibrated by the health staff.
Ethical considerations
Ethical approval was sought for the study from Ghana
Health Service Ethical Review Committee. Informed
consent form was used to seek the consent of all partici-
pants before inclusion in the study.
Statistical analysis
We compared the average birth weight and the risk of
low birth weight according to categories of charcoal and
garbage burning-related exposure using t-test and Chi-
square test to assess the role of chance. Chi-square test
was also used to investigate the differences in cooking
fuel choices of mothers according to their socioeco-
nomic characteristics. We applied multivariate methods
for assessing the exposure-outcome relations. First, we
applied multiple linear regression to estimate the inde-
pendent and joint effects of the two exposures on aver-
age birth weight. Second, we applied generalized linear
models (PROC GENMOD) with Poisson distribution
and log link to estimate the independent and joint
effects of indoor air pollution on the risk of LBW. All
models were adjusted for age, social class, marital status
and gravidity of mothers; and sex of neonate. Pearson's
correlation and Mantel-Haenszel linear by linear Chi-
square test was used for trend analysis of the exposure-
response relationships. We performed sensitivity analysis
by restricting the analysis to term births (≥37 weeks of
gestation). SPSS version 16.0 was used to perform all the
analysis with the exception of the PROC GENMOD ana-
lysis which was done with SAS version 9.3.
Results
The characteristics of the mothers and their neonates
are presented in Table 1 and Table 2. More than half
(58.8%) of the respondents were classified as low social
class with about 5% of the respondents identified as high
social class. A quarter (25.3%) of the respondents were
young mothers (<24 years) with older mothers (>35
years) making up about 15% of the respondents studied.
Majority of the respondents (77.2%) were married. A
high proportion of the respondents (45.1%) were edu-
cated up to junior high level. About 7% of the respon-
dents
had
no
formal
education.
Majority
of
the
respondents (43.6%) were traders and street vendors.
Hairdressers and seamstresses made up about 30% of
the respondents studied. The proportion of office work-
ers was 6%. About 39% of the respondents were primi-
gravida. Of the mothers studied, 94.3% were cooking
during pregnancy. Half of the mothers who cooked
(50.5%) used charcoal only with about 29% of them
using LPG only. About 19% of the mothers used a com-
bination of both fuels. Cooking fuel choices of mothers
was dependent on their social class, educational level
and occupation. Of the proportion of charcoal users,
and charcoal & LPG users, more than half respectively
were identified as low social class. Of the proportion of
mothers identified as high social class, majority used
LPG for cooking. Also, of the proportion of mothers
with no formal education and those educated up to jun-
ior high level, over half of them used charcoal for cook-
ing. Of the tertiary educated mothers, over half of them
used LPG for cooking. Charcoal users were mostly tra-
ders,
street
vendors,
hairdressers
and
seamstresses.
Office workers mostly used LPG for cooking. About 27%

of the mothers studied reported garbage burning in their
homes during pregnancy. The proportion of mothers
using charcoal only for cooking and burning garbage at
home simultaneously was 15%.
More than half of the neonates (53.2%) were males. First
order births made up about 38% of the neonates. Neo-
nates delivered to charcoal users, and charcoal & LPG
users were respectively 322g and 254g lighter than neo-
nates delivered to LPG users. The differences in means
were highly
significant. Also,
neonates
delivered
to
mothers burning garbage at home were 310g lighter than
neonates delivered to LPG users. The mean difference was
also significant. Neonates delivered to mothers using char-
coal only for cooking as well as burning garbage at home
were 392g lighter than neonates delivered to LPG user.
The mean difference was statistically significant. About
18% of the neonates were born LBW. The risk of LBW
was related to fuel choices and garbage burning practices
of mothers, independently and jointly.
The unadjusted and adjusted effect of cooking fuel use
and garbage burning at home on birth weight and risk
of LBW are presented in Table 3 and Table 4. Charcoal
use and garbage burning at home were all determinants
of reduced birth weight. The estimated reduction in
birth weight was 243g (95% CI: 496, 11) and 178g (95%
CI: 421, 65) for use of charcoal, and garbage burning at
home. The associations were however not statistically
significant.
An
exposure-response
relationship
was
nonetheless noted with high exposure from charcoal use
and garbage burning associated with an increased reduc-
tion in birth weight. A linear trend test of the association
was statistically significant. The use of charcoal together

with garbage burning at home was associated with fur-
ther reductions in birth weight. The estimated reduction
in birth weight was 429g (95% CI: 259, 599).
Use of charcoal and garbage burning at home were risk
factors for LBW. Garbage burning at home resulted in a
195% increase in the risk of LBW. High exposure from
garbage burning was also associated with a 359% increase
in the risk of LBW. A linear trend test of the association
was statistically significant. Charcoal use generally was
associated with a small and statistically insignificant in-
crease in the risk of LBW. Applying the ordinal scale ex-
posure parameter for charcoal however resulted in a
statistically significant association, albeit an inverse trend
was observed with high exposure associated with decrease
risk. Charcoal use together with garbage burning at home
was associated with further increase in the risk of LBW.
The estimated increase in the risk of LBW for joint char-
coal use and garbage burning was 316%.
The sensitivity analysis produced similar results but
with slightly lower effect estimates generally.
Discussion
The results of our study indicate a strong, exposure-
related inverse association between maternal use of char-
coal as cooking fuel during pregnancy and birth weight
of the newborn. The average birth weight of babies born
among exposed mother was 243g (95% CI: 496, 11)
lower compared with the babies of mothers using LPG
as cooking fuel. Garbage burning at home was an im-
portant risk factor for LBW. Garbage burning was asso-
ciated with a 195% (RR=2.95; 95% CI: 1.10, 7.92)
increase in the risk of LBW. Joint evaluation of these
two exposures resulted in further reductions in birth
weight and additional increase in the risk of LBW.
Validity of results
We selected consecutive mothers giving birth in a teach-
ing hospital and thus the study population represents a
defined catchment area. We achieved a high response
rate (91.5%) which minimizes selection bias. Mothers giv-
ing birth at KBTH as against other facilities in the study
area where not a distinct cohort from the source popula-
tion but do so mainly because of the hospital's proximity
to their homes and/or the comprehensive and specialist
services on offer. We also carefully excluded mothers re-
ferred to the facility for whatever reason from the study.
The outcome of interest was measured and recorded in-
dependently from the study and represent a well defined
and objective variable with a negligible measurement
error. Information on exposure and potential confoun-
ders was collected retrospectively. Use of cooking fuel
choices and garbage burning practices represents quanti-
tatively well-defined entity and it is reasonable to assume
that retrospective data collection resulted in relatively re-
liable data on maternal exposure during pregnancy. The
ordinal scale exposure variable per the use of maternal
report of fuel type, and cooking and garbage burning
practices was sensitive to certain amount of measure-
ment error but was however not likely to be related to
the outcome of interest. In summary, it reasonable to as-
sume the exposure assessment reflects reasonably well
the exposure conditions during pregnancy.
Although we applied a cross-sectional study design, we
were able to collect reasonably valid exposure information

from the time period relevant for causation of reduction
in fetal growth and therefore our results support a causal
relation between the exposures and the outcome of inter-
est. Establishment of temporal relation may be problematic
in some research settings with the use of cross-sectional
study design. This however should not be a concern in our
study because it is clear that exposure to combustion pol-
lutants was present during pregnancy among mothers who
cooked with charcoal and those who reported garbage
burning at their homes. Also it was increasingly clear
from the information collected from the mothers and
summarized by the investigators that the choices of
cooking fuels and garbage burning activities remained
relatively stable in our research settings. It is possible that
some women using charcoal during most of the duration
of pregnancy might have reported use of LPG as their
primary fuel, but this information bias would rather tend
to underestimate the true effect. We were not able to

undertake air quality measurements in homes of the
mothers. The potential for exposure misclassification
nonetheless is reduced in our study because the quantita-
tive assessment of exposure to combustion pollutants
from charcoal use and garbage burning comprised sev-
eral types of information collected from participants and
summarized by the investigators, including duration of
cooking, time spent in cooking area, type of ventilation
applied as well as frequency of garbage burning at home
and how often mothers were present during combustion.
The study adjusted for the effect of age, social class,
marital status and gravidity of mothers, and sex of neo-
nate in the analysis. We had reliable information on ges-
tational age of mothers but did not consider it as a
covariate in the analysis based on a recent work by
Wilcox and colleagues [15] which reported gestational
age as a collider and provided evidence of the likely bias
produced by adjustment for gestational age in statistical
analysis. We were however unable to examine the effect
of other determinants of birth weight such as maternal
nutrition and anthropometry, malaria and sexually trans-
mitted infections. IAP exposure during pregnancy is not
expected to be dependent on these factors hence the
estimated effect of IAP exposure on birth weight is not
likely to be confounded by these factors. Maternal smok-
ing is another important determinant of birth weight,
but in Ghana only few women smoke. The 2008 Ghana
Demographic and Health Survey [16] estimated the pro-
portion of women smoking cigarettes and other tobacco
products to be 0.4%. Maternal smoking can therefore
not be considered as a serious threat to validity in this
study.
Cooking
fuel
was
related
to
social
class
(p<0.0001), educational level (p<0.0001) and occupation
(p<0.0001) of mothers and likely to influence IAP expos-
ure experience during pregnancy. LPG was the primary
fuel of high social class mothers with charcoal the pre-
ferred fuel of low social class mothers. Uneducated and
semi-literate
(educated
up
to
junior
high
school)
mothers preferred charcoal with tertiary level educated
mothers patronizing LPG. Traders, street vendors, hair-
dressers and seamstresses had preference for charcoal
with office workers preferring LPG. Studies in Ethiopia
[17], Cameroun [18] and Kenya [19] also associated
household cooking fuel choices with employment, in-
come, educational level and social class of women. We
adjusted for the effect of social class but not educational
level and occupation of mothers in the analysis due to
the well known fact that education and occupation
determines social class of an individual, and also the fact
they were unrelated to birth weight in our analysis. Con-
trolling for confounding by social class is always prob-
lematic especially in our study where more than half
(58.8%) of the study participants were low social class.
This is due to the strong effects of social class on health
outcomes. We do not therefore overrule the possibility
of residual confounding by social class in our study, but
we think residual confounding does not solely explain
our observations on the adverse effects of combustion
products from charcoal and garbage burning.
Synthesis with previous studies
A systematic literature search identified six previous
studies conducted in Guatemala [9,10], Zimbabwe [11],
Pakistan [12] and India [13,14] that have assessed the
relationship between indoor pollution from solid fuel
use and birth weight. The study in Guatemala [9] found
babies born to mothers who used wood to be 63g lighter
than babies born to mothers who used gas or electricity.
The other study in Guatemala [10] was a randomized
control trial and found infants born to mothers who
used open fires (control group) to be on average 89g
lighter than infants whose mothers used a chimney stove
(intervention group). The study in Zimbabwe [11] found
babies born to mothers cooking with wood, dung, or
straw to be on average 175g lighter compared with ba-
bies born to mothers using LPG, natural gas, or electri-
city. In the Pakistan study [12], infants born to wood
users were on average 82g lighter than infants born to
natural gas users. This study also estimated the popula-
tion attributable risk for LBW explained by wood use to
be 24%. The earlier Indian study [13] found infants born
to women from households using wood and/or dung as
primary cooking fuel to be 104.5g lighter than infants
born to mothers from households using biogas or kero-
sene. This study also reported exposure to biomass fuel
to be associated with an adjusted 49% increased risk of
LBW. The recent Indian study [14] found children born
in households using high pollution fuels (wood, straw,
animal dung, crop residues, kerosene, coal and charcoal)
to be 73g lighter than those born in households using
low pollution fuels (electricity, LPG, natural gas and bio-
gas). A recent meta-analysis [20] of five studies examin-
ing this relationship also estimated a reduced mean birth
weight of 95.6g (95% CI: 68.5, 124.7) and an increase risk
of LBW of 38% (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.52) among
women exposed to IAP. This study also estimated the
population attributable risk for LBW explained by IAP
to be 21%.
The findings of our study are consistent with these
previous studies albeit our effect estimates were quite
larger than any previously reported. The similar results
produced from the sensitivity analysis means use of
charcoal as cooking fuel and garbage burning at home
represents an important threat to optimal fetal growth.
We do not by any means imply with the large effect
sizes reported that charcoal is a high polluting and more
potent fuel than other biomass like wood, dung and crop
residue. Garbage burning on the other hand releases

dioxins, hazardous chemical substances that have been
shown in animal studies to severely impair fetal growth
even at low levels of exposure. Studies in human popula-
tions have also reported associations of low level dioxin
exposure during pregnancy with decreased birth weight
[21-24]. Our study and the previous reviewed however
did not actually measure the quantity of biomass com-
busted and the amount of pollutants released for which
mothers were exposed. It is therefore reasonable to as-
sume that our study participants might have on average
combusted large quantities of charcoal and garbage
during pregnancy with the cumulative adverse effect
reflected in the large effect estimates reported. The sig-
nificant exposure-response relationship observed by our
study to some extent confirms this assertion. We must
however emphasize that unmeasured confounding, and
residual confounding by social class as already noted
could contribute to the large effect sizes reported in
spite of efforts to eliminate this potential confounding
from our study.
The studies highlighted however had some limitations
which our study was purposely designed to address and
strengthen the epidemiological evidence. Firstly, the
studies in Zimbabwe [11] and India [14] relied on
mothers self-report of child size at birth in respectively
estimating birth weight of 47% and 60% of their study
infants. This could have resulted in under or over esti-
mation of birth weight of these infants. Secondly, the
other studies cited [9,10,12,13] were community-based
and obtaining timely measurement of birth weight of
infants delivered at home was problematic. The time of
measurement in some cases raises doubt about their ac-
ceptability as true reflection of birth weight of these
infants. A baby's weight can fluctuate within the first
week of life with newborns losing up to 10% of their
birth weight during the first 3–5 days of life. Some of
the studies in an attempt to address this limitation,
restricted birth weight analysis to newborns weighed
within 48–72 hours after birth. Lastly, majority of house-
holds in developing countries use a combination of
cooking fuels with those in urban areas especially usually
using a combination of polluting and clean fuels as a
way of reducing household fuel bills and to at times has-
ten the preparation of meals. In Ghana for instance, ma-
jority of urban households mostly use LPG for preparing
sauces, stews, soups and continental meals with charcoal
used mainly for preparing staple foods such as banku,
fufu and ampesi. Most of the households that use LPG
for cooking are also compelled to rely on charcoal when
LPG is in short supply. All the studies highlighted
collected information on primary cooking fuel of partici-
pants without attempting to identify participants using a
combination of cooking fuels. This distinction is import-
ant for proper quantification of exposure experiences of
study participants. For instance, in settings where use of
combination of polluting and clean fuels prevails, asses-
sing only primary cooking fuel could result in under or
over estimation of exposure. About 19% of the mothers
who participated in our study used a combination of
charcoal and LPG for cooking.
Our study to the best of our knowledge is the first to
examine the contribution of garbage burning at home to
the indoor exposure experience of pregnant women, and
its relation with birth weight of newborns. Over a quar-
ter (27%) of the mothers studied reported garbage burn-
ing in their homes during pregnancy. Garbage burning is
a frequent practice in a number of Ghanaian urban
households as a way of managing their solid waste. This
is because most urban areas especially the secluded and
deprived zones are usually not reached with waste col-
lection services. Areas receiving these services are also
faced with untimely and irregular service provision. In
rural Ghana, the situation is different with younger
members of the household tasked with disposing of the
household waste at designated sites in the community
each morning. The sight of garbage burning in rural
households is therefore uncommon.
Biological plausibility
Burning of charcoal, other solid fuels and garbage emits
smoke which contains a number of air pollutants includ-
ing carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM).
Inhaled CO and PM impairs fetal growth in two ways;
(1) CO combines with hemoglobin to cross the placenta
decreasing oxygen supply to tissue which limits the abil-
ity of the placenta to transfer nutrients to the fetus, and
(2) PM reduces maternal lung function thereby increas-
ing the risk of maternal lung disease, and in turn redu-
cing oxygen delivery to the fetus as well as causing cell
damage in the fetus through oxidative stress [25,26].
Impaired fetal growth subsequently leads to reduced or
low birth weight [26,27]. Also, reduced oxygen transport
across the placenta and fetal uptake due to reduced oxy-
gen supply to the placenta can result in preterm delivery
and consequently reduced or low birth weight [27]. The
fetus in particular is considered to be highly susceptible
to environmental pollutants because of its differential
exposure pattern and physiological immaturity [28,29].
The high cell proliferation and changing metabolic
mechanisms during the critical phase of fetal develop-
ment have been identified as the physiological process
that renders the developing fetus extremely vulnerable
to environmental toxicants [30].
Conclusions
Our results proved evidence that maternal use of char-
coal as a cooking fuel during pregnancy and burning of
garbage at home are strong determinants of average fetal

Environmental and Health Impacts
of Household Solid Waste Handling and
Disposal Practices in Third World Cities:
The Case of the Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana

Abstract
Inadequate provision of solid waste management facilities in
Third World cities results in indiscriminate disposal and un-
sanitary environments, which threatens the health of urhan residents. The study reported
here examined household-level waste management and disposal practices in the Accra
Metropolitan Area, Ghana. Tbe residents of Accra cunently generate large amounts of sol-
id waste, heyond the management capabilities of the existing waste management system.
Because the solid waste infrastructure is inadequate, over 80 percent of the population
do not have home collection services. Only 13.5 percent of respondents are served witb
door-to-door collection of solid waste, while tbe rest dispose of tbeir waste at eommunal
collection points, in open spaces, and in waterways. The majority of households store
tbeir waste in open containers and plastic bags in the bome. Waste storage in tbe home is
associated with the presence of bouseflies in the kitchen (r = .17, p < .0001). Tbe presence
of houseflies in the kitchen during cooking is correlated with the incidence of childhood
diarrhea (r = .36, p < .0001). Inadequate solid waste facilities result in indiscriminate
hurning and burying of solid waste. There is an association between waste burning and the
incidence of respiratory health symptoms among adults (r = .25, p < .0001) and children
(r = .22, p < .05). Poor handling and disposal of waste are major causes of environmental
pollution, wbieb creates breeding grounds for pathogenic organisms, and tbe spread of
infectious diseases. Improving access to solid waste collection facilities and services will
help achieve sound environmental bealtb in Accra.
Introduction
The rapid growth of cities in the develop-
ing world in recent decades has resulted in
increased consumption of resources to meet
the growing demands ot urban populations
and industry, and this situation leads to the
generation of large amounts of waste in cities.
Because of weak institutional capacities and
a lack of resources, both human and capital,
waste management and sanitation in many
Third World cities, particularly in Africa,
are in very deplorable condition. Between
20 and 80 percent of solid waste in African
cities is disposed of by dumping in open
spaces, water bodies, and surface drains as
a result of inadequate infrastructure (United
Nations Environment Programme, 1999).
Indiscriminate disposal of organic waste
is detrimental to health because it creates
unsanitary environments that have adverse
impacts for urban residents. Where sanitary
facilities are scarce, household solid wastes
also tend to be mixed with fecal matter, fur-
ther compounding the health hazards (Kjel-
len, 2001).
Tbe residents of Accra generate in to-
tal an estimated 1,500 to 1,800 tons of
solid waste per day (Senior Environmental
Health Technologist of the Accra Waste De-
partment, personal communication). The
existing solid waste management system is
capable of collecting only 65 percent of the
waste generated daily, leaving the remain-
ing 35 percent to gradually accumulate into
waste mountains, wbich have become com-
mon sights in parts of the city. Home collec-
tion of solid waste is limited to households
of high and medium wealth, while the poor
dispose of their waste at communal collec-
tion containers, into surface drains, in open
spaces, and in water bodies. Some residents

burn their solid waste, while others indis-

al, burning, and burying of solid waste pose
major environmental and health threats
through pollution and through the breed-
ing of pathogenic organisms. Infectious
diseases of poor sanitation and poverty are
the most common diseases affecting lhe
residents of Accra. Like most other Ghana-
ian cities, Accra falls into the category of
deveioping-world cities that Briscoe (1993)
described as already facing the problems of
improper waste disposal, contamination of
water and streams, and many service man-
agement deficiencies.
Materials and Methods
The study involved interviews with 960 fe-
male heads of household selected from Ac-
cra. The survey was undertaken between
June and August 2003. Interviews were
conducted in two local dialects, Ga and Twi.
The simple random method was employed
for the population sampling. The greatest
advantage of this method is that each mem-
ber of the population is chosen completely
at random in thc study area, with no subjec-
tive influence or bias on the part of the field
personnel. Residential communities were
randomly selected by lottery. Within each
selected community, households were ran-
domly selected for interview. A household
was defined as individuals who occupy the
same living space and normally share food
and amenities. The target population was
female household heads since women are
responsible lor upkeep and general house-
hold environmental management. All re-
spondents older than 20 years of age were
included in the study. A detailed structured
questionnaire was used to collect informa-
tion on household solid waste storage and
disposal practices, waste burning, and waste
burying. Information was also collected on
pest iniestation, the incidence of respira-
tory health symptoms, and the incidence
of diarrhea among the 489 children under
six years of age who were covered by the
study. Diarrhea was defined as the passing of
three or more loose, watery, or bloody stools
within a 24-hour period (Martines, Phillips,
& Feachem, 1993). The passing of bloody
stools was further defined as dysentery, an
acute form ol diarrhea. The definition of
respirator)' health symptoms included sore
throat, dry cough, and wet cough (Songsore
et al., 1998). Health data are based on re-
spondents' self-reporting of il! health, ac-
cording to a two-week recall.
Since the interviewees were only women,
all the inter\'iewers were female students se-
lected from the University of Ghana, Legon.
in order to enhance cooperation and will-
ingness to provide information. All the data
collectors had had at least one experience in
conducting interview sun'eys. For the pur-
pose of this study, a two-day theoretical as
well as practical training was conducted for
the data collectors. The time taken to admin-
ister each questionnaire was between 25 and
30 minutes. Respondents were generally very
cooperative in providing information. Ques-
tionnaires were checked for eompleteness
and accuracy by the principal investigator
before entry Data were entered in an Excel
spreadsheet and imported to SPSS 11.0 for
Windows. The assoeiation between depen-
dent and independent variables was mea-
sured with the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spear-
man's rank correlation. Multivariate analyses
of variance were performed to evaluate the
significance of associations obtained in the
univariate analysis between variables and the
incidence of respiratory infections and child-
hood diarrhea. Probability values of less than
.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
The majority of households store solid
waste in the home, with only 22.6 percent
of households storing their waste outside
the home {Table 1). Household solid waste
storage practices, particularly storage of
waste in the home, are associated with the
presence of houseflies in the kitchen dur-
ing cooking (r= .17, p< .0001) (Figure 1).

The presence of flies in the kitchen is also
related to the method oi solid waste dispos-
al (r = .24. p < .0001). More than 33.6 per-
cent of respondents who dispose of waste
at collection points, 32.4 percent of those
who dispose of solid waste in empty yards,
and 44.4 percent of those who dispose of
waste in waterways reported that flies were
always present in the kitchen. This result
indicates that solid waste is usually dis-
posed of close to the home. Households
that store solid waste in the home are more
likely to report the presence of flies in the
toilet ( r = 40.03, 3 d/, p < .0001}. The
presence of flies in the toilet is correlated
with the presence of flies in the kitchen (r
= .28, p < .0001). The majority of respond-
ents who reported always seeing flies in the
toilet (51.0 percent, n = 153) also reported
that flies were always present in the kitchen
during food preparation. A significant asso-
ciation was also obtained in the multivari-
ate analyses of variance between flies in the
toilet and flies in the kitchen (p < .0001).
It was found that 19.2 percent (it = 94)
of the children covered by the study had
had diarrhea in the two weeks preceding
the study. There was a positive correlation
between the presence of houseflies in the
kitchen during cooking and the incidence
of childhood diarrhea {r = .35, p < .0001).
High incidence of diarrhea is particularly
associated with flies always present in the
food area (Figure 2). A total of 24 (85.7
percent) of children with dysentery cases
live in homes where the mothers reported
that houseflies were always present in the
kitchen. Fly infestation in the kitchen
maintained its significant association with
the incidence of diarrhea in the multivariate
analyses (p = .002, 95 percent confidence
interval |C1]). High incidence of childhood
diarrhea also was found to he associated
with the presence of flies in the household
toilet (r = .35, p < .0001). In addition, the
tnultivariate test showed a significant as-
sociation between the presence of flies in
the toilet and the incidence of diarrhea (p
= .006, 95 percent CI). About 71.4 percent
(n = 20) of dysentery cases lived in homes
reporting that Hies were always present in
the household toilet.
Only 13.5 percent of households have
door-to-door collection of solid waste,
while the rest dispose of their waste at com-
munal collection points, in open spaces,
or in waterways (Table 2). Indiscriminate
disposal of waste is high among households

of respondents who store waste in plas-
tic bags dispose of waste in empty yards,
compared with only 9.7 percent of those
who do not store waste and 11.8 percent of
those who store waste in closed containers.
Whereas 17.0 percent of those who store
waste in plastic bags dispose of waste in wa-
terways, only 3.8 percent of those who store
waste in open containers and 5.4 percent of
those who store waste in closed containers
dispose of waste in waterways. A total of
137 respondents (14.3 percent) burn part
of their solid waste, while 11.3 percent {n
= 99) bury part of their waste. Households
that practice open disposal of solid waste are
also more likely to burn part of their waste
( r = 279.12, 4 df, p < .0001) (Table 3).
Waste burning is high among households
that store waste in plastic bags {)P- = 20.14,
5dj,p< .0001). About 27.7 percent of those
who store waste in plastic bags burn part
of their waste, compared with 14.7 percent
of those who store waste in closed contain-
ers, 14.1 percent of those who store waste
in open containers, and 8.3 percent of those
who do not store waste. Burning solid waste
Is correlated with the incidence of respira-
tory health symptotns among both adults
(i- = .25. p < .0001) and children (r ^ .22,
p < .05). In the multivariate test of variance,
solid waste burning showed a significant as-
sociation with the incidence of respiratory
infections in adttits (p = .004, 95 percent
CI) and children (p = .01, 95 percent CI).

Home storage of solid waste is a com-
mon practice among households in Accra.

Many households store their waste in open
containers ranging from baskets to plastic
bags, making home storage unhygienic.
Over 70 percent of household solid waste
generated in Accra is organic matter (Lar-
yea, 1997), which, under prevailing high
tropical temperatures, decomposes rapidly
and produces bad odors. Decomposing or-
ganic waste, when improperly stored in
open containers for long periods, becomes
detrimental to health hecause it increases
the breeding of disease-carrying vectors
like rodents and insects. The storage of
organic waste in open containers also at-
tracts houseflies to the household kitchen.
Houseflies are vectors for various iniectious
diseases and transmit diseases through food
contamination either by direct contact witb
food or through their droppings. The high
incidence ot diarrhea among children under
six years of age is related to food contami-
nation by flies. Donifeh (1999) found that
infectious diseases from poor sanitation,
including diarrhea, are among the most
common bealtb problems reported at out-
patient facilities in Accra.
Access to disposal facilities is limited for
the majority of households. Only a small
proportion of households in Accra have
bome collection services, while the great
majority dispose of their waste at commu-
nal collection containers provided by the
Waste Management Department. The few
waste containers that serve as collection
points, however, are inefficient because ol
tbeir small voiume, the small numbers serv-
ing large communities, and infrequent re-
movals of waste (Boadi fa Kuitunen, 2003).
The Waste Department has 528 refuse con-
tainers, but only 330 are presently on site

of the Accra Waste Department, personal
communication). Stephens and co-authors
(1994) reported that many household.s were
more than 500 meters from central refuse
containers. Households facing inadequate
access to dumping facilities dump their
waste in waterways and in any available open
spaces that gradually become refuse moun-
tains in parts of tbe city Open spaces and
empty yards in which refuse accumulates
serve as breeding grounds for rats, flies, and
other vectors of disease pathogens. Solid
waste hurning is a serious problem beeause
of inadequate access to proper disposal
facilities and services. Waste burning con-
tributes to localized as well as citywide air
pollution problems (Kjellen, 2001). Smoke
from burning waste may be detrimental to
thc health of urban residents through tbe
inhalation of respirable suspended particu-
lates, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. The burning
of solid waste is associated with high in-
cidence of respiratory health symptoms
among households that burn their waste.
A similar study of household-level environ-
mental problems in Jakarta found a correla-
tion between uncoilected garbage and the
occurrence of respiratory diseases in moth-
ers and children, probably because house-
holds with no collection services burned
their garbage (Surjadi. 1993).
inadequate access to disposal facilities
results in indiscriminate disposal in open
spaces and surface drains. Almost every sur-
face drainage channel in Accra is blocked
with solid waste. Stagnant waters in blocked
drains provide breeding grounds for dis-
ease vectors and pathogens, including the
anopheles mosquito, whicb transmits ma-
laria. Malaria accounted for 39.7 percent of
all reported diseases at outpatient facilities
in 1995 and 53 percent in 1998 (Domfeh,
1999; Healthy Cities Programme, 1999),
and it is the leading cause of morbidity in
Accra. The resulting environmental health
hazards are worsened when overflowing
drains are contaminated with fecal matter.
These wastewaters may carry a spectrum
of endemic fecal pathogens, including hel-
minths, protozoans, bacteria, and viruses,
at concentrations that can he great enough
to create the potential for human infections
(Shuval. Adin. Fattal, Rawitz, & Yekutiel,
1986). Some pathogens, including Trichu-
ris trichiura, Jaenia saginata, and Ascaris
iumhricoides, can survive at infective stages
outside their host for months (Cointreau.
2000) in contaminated grounds. Children in
particular are exposed to pathogenic organ-
isms when they play on fecally contaminated
grounds, increasing their risk of infection.
Household solid waste contains both
hazardous and nonhazardous components,
which are lumped together and disposed of
in tbe open, or buried. Hazardous wastes
pose many serious bealth threats, inciud-
ing chronic and acute toxicity, cancer, birth
defects, explosion, and corrosion. Leach-
ate from the organic matter in open dumps
could easily pollute underground water and
pose major environmental health threats, lt
has been associated with the contamination
of aquifers underlying landfills (McFar-
lane. Cherry. Cilman, fa Sudicky, 1983; Re-
inbard, Goodman, fa Barker, 1984; Zanoni,
1972). The potential for 
surface-water
contamination increases in tbe rainy sea-
son because of flooding in low-lying areas
in tbe proximity of open dumps (United
Nations Environment Programme, 1996).
Also, waste may eventually get washed
away by rainwater to contaminate water
bodies or block drainage channels (Kjellen,
2001). Open dumps are associated with
bad and unpleasant odors in Accra. Odors
resuh from concentrations of odorous
constituents of decomposing organic mat-
ter emitted into the atmosphere and have
been described as an environmental nui-
sance (Young fa Heasman. 1985; Young &
Parker, 1983). Residents in close proximity
to open dumping sites, usually the urban
poor, are exposed to direct contamination
from hand to mouth and through the in-
halation of dangerous volatile compounds
and aerosols (Zurbrugg, 1999).

The study reporicd here demonstrated the
problems of household sohd waste practices
and the associated environmental and health
problems. Access to safe disposal facilities is
limited for the great majority of households,
and this circumstance results in indiscrimi-
nate disposal practices, improper burning,
and burying of sohd waste. Deteriorating en-
vironmental quahty is a major cause of high
incidences of infectious and parasitic diseas-
es. These problems obstruct in no small way
the possibility of sustainable development.
An efficient solid waste management system
remains an appropriate tool for achieving
sound environmental health in Accra. Im-
proving access to safe disposal facihties, in
addition to conducting awareness campaigns
on the health impactsof poor sanitation, will
help alleviate the problems oi improper waste
disposal and eventually improve the quality
ot the environment in the city. Recycling
mountains of waste into useful resources will
create jobs for recyclers, while also improv-
ing the environment by reducing indiscrimi-
nate disposal, the amount of waste being
disposed of in landfills, and the depletion of
resources. Metals such as aluminium can be
recovered and sold to small-scale recyclers
to produce valuable items such as lamps and
cooking utensils to compete with imports.
Organic waste can be composted and used
as fertilizer in urban farming and help re-
duce reliance on inorganic fertilizers. Waste
recycling is usually undertaken by inlormal
recyclers, whom it is essential to fully inte-
grate into the waste management stream in
order to realize the benefits of their contribu-
tions to environmental management in Ac-
cra. Informal recyclers can be mobilized into
cooperative organizations to pull resources
together for investment, and also can be pro-
vided with training, protective clothing, and
equipment to reduce accidents, infections,
and deaths. The Waste Management Depart-
ment must also provide the necessary- incen-
tive packages to attract private investors into
the sector through competitive bidding for
contracts.

"Plastic waste generation and emissions from the
domestic open burning of plastic waste in
Guatemala†

Domestic, or household-level, open burning of plastic waste is a source of air pollutants and greenhouse
gases that are often neglected in emission inventories. Domestic open burning is a considerable concern
in Guatemala due to the lack of access to waste collection services, particularly in rural areas. This paper
oﬀers the ﬁrst attempt to estimate emissions from the domestic open burning of waste at the city and
departmental levels in Guatemala. Data were collected from the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala
and analyzed to determine the change in plastic waste generation over time as well as the
socioeconomic factors that may aﬀect the extent of plastic waste generation and burning. The annual
per capita masses of plastic waste burned were used to estimate emissions from domestic open burning
of plastic waste in the region of Xalap´an, the cities of Jutiapa and Guatemala city, and all 22 departments
in Guatemala. Our results show that rural areas burn more waste domestically, likely because of a lack of
access to waste collection, and 30.4% of OC, 24.0% of BC, 23.6% of PM2.5, and 2.4% of CO2 emissions in
Guatemala may not be accounted for by excluding open plastic burning as a source.
Environmental signicance
Domestic burning of plastic waste is a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and household air pollution (HAP) that aﬀects human health. This is of
particular concern in countries such as Guatemala, where burning is a main method of waste disposal in rural areas. Current emission inventories do not
include emission data on the domestic open burning of plastic waste, which is an under sampled and understudied source of emissions. We nd that including
emissions from the domestic burning of plastic waste in emission inventories would notably increase current emission estimates. Quantifying such emissions
can prevent underestimation of emissions, provide more accurate local, departmental, and national total emission estimates, and inform ways to mitigate the
release of GHGs and HAP.

Introduction
The open burning of plastic waste in domestic, or household-
level, res is a global human health and climate change
concern that has not been well studied. Burning of plastic waste
is of particular concern in the Global South,1–4 especially in
countries such as Guatemala, where the management of solid
waste has become an issue due to a lack of access to infra-
structure, resources, and services necessary to properly manage
and dispose of waste.5 For this reason, waste is oen disposed
of through methods that are harmful to the environment,
including disposing through burning, burial, or in bodies of
water.6 This is particularly concerning for plastic waste, as
plastics that enter marine ecosystems through these waste
disposal methods can accumulate in sediments and induce
physiological stress in aquatic organisms and food chains if
ingested.7–10
In Guatemala, where the present study was conducted,
plastics make up approximately 17.3% of waste generated,11,12
and 43% of all households dispose of their waste, including
plastic, through domestic burning.6 These percentages increase
in more rural areas of the country, which have fewer waste
disposal resources and are in remote locations, far from
municipal waste services.5,6,13 Residents of such areas must
resort to domestic burning to dispose of plastic waste, which
poses the risk of releasing toxic air pollutants into their home
environment. Thus, waste burning could indicate that waste
collection infrastructure must be improved to create better ways
to dispose of waste.

Domestic plastic waste burning can occur both in outdoor
trash res and indoor kitchen res using solid fuel cookstoves.
A laboratory study quantifying emissions from cookstoves
found that although plastic bags produced fewer emissions
than other startup materials, such as kerosene, newspapers,
fabric, and wood shims, the burning of plastic bags to ignite
res still contributed to increased cookstove re emissions.14
Plastic waste burning contributes to emissions of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and toxic substances, including carbon dioxide
(CO2), ne particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of
2.5 mm or less (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC),
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs).15–19 The chemical composition of PM2.5
due to plastic waste incineration and smoldering res includes
BC, OC, ammonium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, antimony (Sb),
and other trace elements.16
Household air pollution (HAP) from the burning of plastic
waste in stoves20 and cooking res poses a harmful respiratory,
cardiovascular, and overall human health hazard.21–26 A recent
study measured EFs for solely dry plastic waste burns and found
that using dry plastic waste instead of biofuels can decrease
open waste burning emissions, although these burns were
conducted in improved devices as opposed to those in more
traditional stoves.20 The health threat from waste burning is still
a particular concern for women and children, as they primarily
occupy the domestic sphere.27–29 In Guatemala, ambient PM2.5
exposure is estimated to result in 4105 annual deaths, 2420 total
years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLD), and 1.4 billion
USD in health damages, including the cost of minimizing the
likelihood of premature death, or mortality, and the cost of
morbidity based on the country's average wage rates.30,31
However, despite being a source of GHG emissions and HAP,
domestic waste burning, usually a mix of organic and inorganic
materials, like plastic, is scarcely sampled and is understudied
as a source of emissions.17 Current emission inventories have
limited data from domestic burning of plastic waste, which
could result in an underestimation of total emissions.32–34
Accurately quantifying emissions is important for determining
mixing ratios of GHGs and mass concentrations of other air
pollutants released into the air from diﬀerent emission sour-
ces.16,17,28 Our study examined plastic waste generation in
households in one community in the Xalap´an region in the
Department of Jalapa to estimate emissions of various pollut-
ants from plastic burning and to determine the eﬀects of
potential interventions to reduce plastic waste among study
participants. In our study, “plastic” refers to mostly single-use
household plastic items, such as plastic packaging, bags,
plates,
utensils,
straws,
gloves,
bottles,
and
containers,
disposed of by the participants in our study.
Since domestic burning of plastic waste is a common form of
waste disposal in Guatemala, the purpose of this paper is to
estimate emissions and contributions to total national emis-
sions from the domestic burning of plastic waste. This study is
the rst local and regional emission estimate of chemical
species due to the domestic burning of plastic waste in Guate-
mala. We estimated emissions from domestic plastic waste
burning in Guatemala, including: (1) in the La Fuente rural
community from the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala; (2) at
the
departmental
level
for
Guatemala's
22
departments
(Fig. S1†);6 (3) in Jutiapa, the capital city of the Department of
Jutiapa, which has a population that is about equally urban and
rural, and is located approximately 40 kilometers from Jalapa;
and (4) in Guatemala city, the capital of the Department of
Guatemala, which has a population that is 91% urban.6 We
initially aimed to investigate the city of Jalapa, which is the city
closest to the Xalap´an region; however, the World Bank11,12
lacked data on the city of Jalapa. Therefore, we chose to estimate
emissions in the city of Jutiapa, as it is close in population size
and location to Jalapa.

Methods
2.1
Working groups, questionnaire, and data collection
We conducted a 10-week working group session to discuss solid
alternatives to burning plastic waste in one rural indigenous
community in the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala. This
region lacks access to formal municipal or private waste
collection programs. One community was chosen based on
accessibility to public transportation, the presence of a large
meeting space to conduct weekly activities, and the community
leadership committee's approval of the study. All accessible
households were visited and asked if they would be interested in
participating in any combination of the following three activi-
ties: (1) in-home participatory observation of plastic waste
disposal; (2) a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP)
survey;35 and (3) a 10-week working group session to discuss
alternatives to burning plastic. The working group session was
conducted in Spanish and met weekly between June and August
2019. Eighty-seven participants (5 male; 82 female) attended the
sessions, which included topics on recycling plastic waste, the
adverse eﬀects of plastics on the environment and human
health, and how to reduce, reuse, and repurpose plastic waste to
improve solid waste management. A sociodemographic ques-
tionnaire (see Table S1†) was verbally administered to partici-
pants from 50 households who attended the rst or second
working group sessions. These participants were also provided
with burlap bags and asked to collect all plastics that they would
have normally burned in an indoor or outdoor re in the bag for
a week. The mass of plastic waste generated per household was
weighed, recorded, and taken to the local dump or recycled
weekly by our project staﬀ. Each participant collected house-
hold plastic waste over a four-week period. The study protocol
and informed consent were approved by the Institutional
Review Boards (IRB) at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala
and Emory University. Written informed consent was obtained
from study participants who participated in the sociodemo-
graphic questionnaire and the collection of plastic waste.
2.2
Calculating emissions
To quantify emissions from the domestic burning of plastic
waste for 62 chemical species in the Xalap´an region, we used
a Monte Carlo sampling methodology.36,37 The emission factors
(EFs) that were used to calculate emissions are taken from the

Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment
(NAMaSTE), which took place in 2014, and EF values were
measured from burns containing plastics as waste.16,28
An EF is a value that contains the unit of mass of a pollutant
released into the air per kilogram of the fuel that is burned.16
Limited data were available for emission factors (EFs) from
waste burning of specically plastics in traditional stoves.
Several studies have measured EFs from waste burns. However,
these EFs were either measured from mixed waste burns or fuel-
based burns that contained separate, specic kinds of plastic
waste (i.e., plastic packaging versus plastic foam), rather than
exclusively plastic waste burns.38–41 The NAMaSTE study is
unique in that it measures EF values from homogeneous plastic
waste burning that this paper focuses on. Although burning
conditions in Nepal and Guatemala would diﬀer, studies
measuring EFs from plastic waste burns and conducted in
Guatemala were not found. The NAMaSTE study obtained data
that most closely t our purposes of estimating emissions from
domestic plastic waste burning res. We used the NAMaSTE's
EF values from re 16 and plastic burns 1 and 2 (the plastic
waste burns)42,43 because of the lack of studies measuring EFs
for plastic waste burning in Guatemala and NAMaSTE's location
in the Global South.
We also quantied the contributions of plastic burning to
total emissions, using the data from the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v5.0), which did not
include open domestic burning in their estimates.16,17,32–34 First,
we created a normal distribution for the mass of plastic waste
burned per capita per year, based on the plastic trash data we
collected in the eld over a month (see Fig. S2†). Second, we
created a normal distribution for an EF for each of the 62
chemical species. Then, we conducted one million Monte Carlo
samplings, selecting one value for the mass of plastic burned
and the other for the EF from the two distributions and multi-
plied them. This methodology was used to calculate emissions
due to the uncertainty associated with the mass and the EF
estimates used. The histogram distributions that resulted from
running a Monte Carlo simulation indicate the range and
probability of possible results for the emission estimates based
on this uncertainty. We used the following equation to nd the
distribution of emissions for each species:
Ei = M × EFi
44
Ei – emissions of air pollutant i [g per year]. M – mass of plastic
burned [kg per year]. EFi – emission factor of air pollutant i [g
per kg plastic burned].
To quantify emissions for each of the departments in Gua-
temala, we rst estimated the mass of plastic burned, using the
most recent Guatemalan 2018 census data6 on population, the
number of households, and the number of households that
burn waste. We rst distributed the average total mass of plastic
waste generated annually per capita in Guatemala, using the
results from our study (12.2 ± 5.8 kg per capita per year) for
a lower boundary estimate and the World Bank value (29.3 kg
per capita per year) for an upper boundary estimate.11,12 The
main cities where data were collected by the World Bank were
Guatemala city, Antigua, and Jutiapa, which are higher-income
areas located in departments with lower poverty rates than
Jalapa, where Xalap´an is located (see Table S2†).6,11,45 Therefore,
lower and upper boundary estimates were used to account for
the varying income levels of the locations where data were
collected, which could aﬀect the estimated per capita waste
generation estimate.46–52 To simplify calculations and allow for
regression analysis between waste generation per department
and socioeconomic and demographic factors in our study, each
mass estimate was distributed among the 22 departments in
Guatemala according to the population in each department.
Individual- or household-level data were not provided by the
World Bank to determine the deviation in per capita plastic
waste generation. Therefore, the singular value of 29.3 kg per
capita per year, rather than a normal distribution, was used for
distributing plastic waste generation by the department. We
then quantied the mass of plastic burned based on the ratio of
households that burn waste in each of the departments, using
the census data. Based on this method, the total estimated
plastic burned for the population in Guatemala was 80.2 Gg per
year for the lower boundary estimate and 193 Gg per year for the
upper boundary estimate. Finally, using the estimated mass of
plastic burned per department and the EF distribution based on
the mean and standard deviation, we created the emission
estimates for each department for the 62 chemical species. The
estimated per capita emissions were compared among the 22
departments in Guatemala. We also multiplied emissions by
the departmental population and summed the results to
determine the total annual national emissions from burning
plastics for PM2.5, BC, OC, CO, and CO2.
For the city-level estimates, we used the World Bank data on
the mass of total waste generated per capita per day and the
percent of total waste that is plastic for Guatemala as a whole, as
the World Bank lacked city-specic data for per capita waste
generation and plastic waste percent composition. We also used
the waste collection rate for Guatemala city (87.5%) and Jutiapa
(28.0%), separately.11,12 There is no data for Jalapa, so we used
the city of Jutiapa as a proxy for Jalapa. We chose Jutiapa
because it is the most proximate city (55 km distance) of
a similar size to Jalapa, as Jutiapa had a population of 145 880
and Jalapa had a population of 159 840 in 2018.6 The diﬀerence
in waste collection rates in diﬀerent locations exemplies the
lack of access to waste collection services in more rural areas,
such as Jutiapa, as compared to more urban areas like Guate-
mala city. The rate of waste not collected, provided by the World
Bank,11,12 was assumed to be burned in order to provide
maximum emission estimates from plastic waste burned.
2.3
Data analysis
All the data analyses and descriptive statistics, including
means, standard deviations, and correlations, as well as
signicance tests (i.e., t-test and ANOVA) were conducted using
R version 4.0.2.53 Signicance tests were used to determine
whether education and wealth, measured by cell phone, radio,
and color television ownership and internet access, signicantly
aﬀected the amount of waste generated by the participants. The

categories for education were as follows: no formal education,
incomplete primary education, complete primary education,
and secondary education. The categories for cell phone, radio,
and color television ownership and internet access were binary
for whether the participants did or did not have ownership or
access to these commodities. Monte Carlo sampling and
emission calculations were also conducted using R.

Results and discussion
3.1
Demographic information
All respondents to the Xalap´an region survey were females, with
an average age of 36 ± 11 years, and the median number of
people living in each participant's household was six people (see
Table 1). Only one participant was studying and had completed
13 years of formal education at the time of our study. The
highest level of education completed by most of the participants
was incomplete primary education (46%), demonstrating low
levels of education received by most of these rural female
participants. Most (88%) of the participants did not work
outside of the home. The most common stove used for cooking
in Jalapa was a poyet´on (52%), which is an elevated open re
stove without a chimney and, in terms of pollution, is similar to
an open re stove. Women were in charge of cooking and waste
disposal, which included domestic burning of plastic waste or
other materials. As a result, they are more prone to harmful air
pollutant exposure. Decreasing plastic waste from household
burning and cooking could thus reduce exposure to pollution
and adverse health-related eﬀects of this exposure.

Plastic waste generation in the Xalap´an region of Jalapa,
Guatemala
The average weight of plastic waste generated per household for
weeks 1 through 4 in the study was 1.31 ± 0.66 kg, 1.12 ± 0.91
kg, 0.92 ± 0.70 kg, and 0.99 ± 0.77 kg, respectively. The average
amount of plastic waste generated by the participants in
Xalap´an over the four-week period was 3.34 × 10−2 ± 1.58 ×
10−2 kg per person per day (see Table S3†).
We conducted hypothesis tests to determine: (1) whether the
average amount of plastic waste generated per household

signicantly changed during the four weeks; and (2) whether
ownership of assets (cell phone, radio, color television,
computer, internet access) and level of education had a statis-
tically signicant impact on the mass of domestic plastic waste
generated. Since the distribution of the total mass of plastic
waste generated per household was slightly right skewed, the
variable for the mass of plastic waste generated per household
was log-transformed when conducting the signicance tests.
There was an overall decrease in the average amount of
plastic waste generated per household over time (Fig. 1). The
decrease in plastic generation was signicant when comparing
the plastic waste generation of week 1 to week 2 (two-tailed two-
sample t-test, p = 0.07), week 3 (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p =
0.001), and to week 4 (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.007;
see Table S4†). These results suggest that the workshops and
trainings conducted during the study could have contributed to
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
plastic
waste
generated
throughout the course of the study. There was a very slight
increase in the mass of waste generated from week 3 to week 4;
however, this diﬀerence was insignicant (two-tailed two-
sample t-test, p = 0.51). This result could be a preliminary
indication of a plateau point for the extent of the eﬀect of the
workshops on the average mass of plastic waste generated.
However, the participants did see this study as an opportunity
to dispose of items that are not easily disposable and that they
had not been able to dispose of due to a lack of access to formal
waste collection. So the rst measurements were more likely to
contain more larger plastic items, such as broken plastic chairs
or toys. Therefore, the decrease in the mass of plastic waste
generated over the four weeks could be aﬀected by a decrease in
large-mass plastic items being brought for measurement and
disposal. There was not a signicant correlation between the
number of persons living in a household and the weight of
plastic waste generated (r = −0.08, p = 0.58). This result
suggests that other factors may better explain the diﬀerence in
the amount of waste produced by each household.
As shown in Table 2, no signicant relationship was
observed between the amount of plastic waste generated and
education level (F = 0.35). Those who owned a cell phone
generated more waste overall, but the diﬀerence in waste
generation between cell phone owners and non-owners was not
signicant (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.62). Those who
owned a radio generated more waste overall, but the diﬀerence
between radio ownership and non-ownership was insignicant
as well (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.50). The relationships
between the amount of plastic generated and: (1) color televi-
sion ownership (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.05) and (2)
internet access (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.07) were
found to be statistically signicant. Those with a color television
or internet access generated signicantly less plastic waste than
those without a color television or without internet access. This
relationship between television or internet access and the mass
of plastic waste generated may result from both variables being
indicative of higher income households that are more likely to
aﬀord durable items. The purchase and use of cheaper,
disposable, and single-use plastic items is more likely in lower
income households that cannot aﬀord higher quality items.
These diﬀerences would thus contribute to higher amounts of
plastic waste being produced in lower income households. Our
results can be compared to a previous study that found that
non-biodegradable,
including
plastic,
waste
generation
decreases from low income to lower middle-income groups,
although this waste generation then increases for middle,
upper-middle, and highest income groups.54 Other studies have
found organic or total solid waste generation to be positively
correlated with the household income level,46,47,49–52 suggesting

that waste composition and the amount of waste produced per
waste type depend on the income level.
Income data are needed to determine the factors that are
indicators of wealth in the rural community of Xalap´an, Gua-
temala, so we can test whether the correlation found with color
television and internet access is related to wealth. In this study
we chose not to ask working group participants about their
household income levels as this would have been perceived as
invasive.

Plastic waste burning emission estimates
The estimated emissions for PM2.5 and CO2 in the Xalap´an
region are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the Xalap´an survey, 84% of
households indicated that they burned their waste as their
primary mode of waste disposal (see Table S3†). Among the
people whose primary mode of disposal is burning, the quan-
tied average amount of plastic waste that would have been
burned per person per day was 2.66 × 10−2 ± 1.32 × 10−2 kg
(see Table S3†) based on the waste collected. Comparing this
with the total mass of plastic waste collected, it was found that
approximately 80% of the mass of plastic waste generated came
from households that use waste burning as their primary mode
of waste disposal (see Table S3†). This percentage (80%)
compares well with the percentage of households that burn
waste as their primary mode of waste disposal in Xalap´an (84%).
These results indicate that the percentage of households that
primarily disposes of waste through burning could be used as
a proxy for calculating the mass of plastic waste burned. We
thus used this value to estimate the average mass of plastic
burned in each department in Guatemala.
The lower and upper boundary estimated mass of plastic
waste burned at the department level in Guatemala based on
the 2018 Guatemalan census data are shown in Table S2.† There
is a large range from 0.645 kg per person per year to 61.4 kg per
person per year, depending on the location. One reason for this
range is likely the diﬀerence in access to private or municipal
waste collection services in urban versus rural areas within each
department. There is a moderate positive correlation between
the percentage of the population in each department that is
rural, and the average mass of plastic waste burned per capita
per year (Fig. 3). A simple linear regression model between these
variables has an R2 value of about 0.63, which suggests that
about 63% of the variance in the average mass of plastic waste
burned domestically can be explained by the size of the rural
population.
The estimated average mass of plastic waste burned based
on the Guatemalan census data was higher in the Department
of Jutiapa (7.44 ± 3.52 kg per capita per year lower bound
estimate; 17.9 kg per capita per year upper bound estimate)
than in the Department of Jalapa (6.04 ± 2.86 kg per capita per

year lower bound estimate; 14.5 kg per capita per year upper
bound estimate) and the Department of Guatemala (1.26 ±
0.594 kg per capita per year lower bound estimate; 3.02 kg per
capita per year upper bound estimate). The mass of plastic
waste generated in the cities of Guatemala city and Jutiapa was
28.1 kg per capita per year and 15.4 kg per capita per year,
respectively (see Table S5†). The percent of plastic waste
assumed to be burned in Jutiapa (87.5%) was notably higher
than that of Guatemala city (28.0%). Although the per capita
plastic waste generation in Guatemala city is about two times
that of Jutiapa, a lower mass of plastic waste is domestically
burned in Guatemala city (7.87 kg per year), as compared to
Jutiapa (13.5 kg per year). This diﬀerence in the waste collection
rate, and thus assumed domestic waste burning rate, highlights
the lack of access to waste collection services in more rural
areas, even cities with a population over 100 000, such as Jutiapa
and Jalapa, compared to Guatemala city. Using this estimated
mass of plastic waste burned, we calculated emission estimates
for the 62 species at the department level in Guatemala using
both methods (see Tables S6 and S7†). Maps of the distribution
of emissions of six pollutants in 22 departments are shown in
Fig. 4.
EDGAR v5.0 currently does not include emissions from the
domestic burning of plastic waste. Our results show that
including plastic waste burning in the EDGAR v5.0 emissions
inventory could increase national emission estimates by
between 6.71 × 106 ± 3.37 × 106 kg per year (5.62 ± 2.82%;
lower boundary estimate) and 1.61 × 107 ± 2.46 × 106 kg per
year (13.5 ± 2.06%; upper boundary estimate) for PM2.5 and by
between 2.07 × 108 ± 9.90 × 107 kg per year (0.564 ± 0.369%;
lower boundary estimate) and (4.99 × 108 ± 3.03 × 107) (1.36 ±
8.25 × 10−2%; upper boundary estimate) for CO2 (see Table 3).
Table 3 also summarizes the estimated total emissions and
percent increases in national emissions for BC, OC, and CO
emissions, if domestic burning of plastic waste was included in
the EDGAR v5.0 (ref. 32–34) emission inventory.
Estimated emissions from the domestic burning of plastic
waste ranged from 2.63 × 104 ± 1.32 × 104 kg per year for PM2.5
and 8.11 × 105 ± 3.87 × 105 kg per year for CO2 in the
Department of Sacatep´equez to 8.46 × 105 ± 4.25 × 105 kg per
year for PM2.5 and 2.61 × 107 ± 1.25 × 107 kg per year for CO2 in
the Department of Alta Verapaz for the lower boundary estimate
(see Table S8†). For the upper boundary estimate, they ranged
from 6.33 × 104 ± 9.64 × 103 kg per year for PM2.5 and 1.96 ×
106 ± 1.19 × 105 kg per year for CO2 in the Department of
Sacatep´equez to 2.03 × 106 ± 3.10 × 105 kg per year for PM2.5
and 6.28 × 107 ± 3.82 × 106 kg per year for CO2 in the
Department of Alta Verapaz (see Table S9†). Most of the pop-
ulation in Alta Verapaz (68.7%) lives in rural areas (see Table
S2†), which may contribute to a lack of access to nearby waste
disposal services, leading to high emissions from plastic
burning in the department. According to the Instituto Nacional
de Estad´ıstica Guatemala (INE; National Statistics Institute of
Guatemala),55 the Department of Alta Verapaz had the highest
poverty rate in the country in 2014, with 83.1% of its population
experiencing poverty (see Table S2†). The socioeconomic status
of the Department of Alta Verapaz may contribute to a lack of
monetary resources for establishing formal waste disposal
programs. The Department of Alta Verapaz, similar to Xalap´an,
also has a high indigenous population, with 93.2% of its pop-
ulation being indigenous (see Table S2†). Therefore, a similar
reduction strategy might be helpful for the regions of Xalap´an
and Alta Verapaz. Providing access to information and educa-
tion about the benets of waste reduction and the risks of waste
burning to human health and the environment were possible
strategies in Xalap´an that could be useful in Alta Verapaz. More
importantly, however, increasing nancial resources for waste
disposal and establishing local waste disposal infrastructure
would help decrease waste burning as a method of disposal and
reduce GHG and air pollutant emissions in these areas. The
information presented in this study may be useful in deter-
mining the extent and types of interventions that should take
place to improve waste collection infrastructure and thus
reduce plastic waste generation in other similar communities.

Conclusions
Our results show that including emissions from the domestic
burning of plastic waste in emission inventories could result in
notable increases in emission estimates, including 7.23 ± 3.58
to 17.4 ± 2.3% for OC, 5.70 ± 2.77 to 13.7 ± 1.38% for BC, 5.62 ±
2.82 to 13.5 ± 2.06% for PM2.5, and 0.564 ± 0.369 to 1.36 ± 8.25
× 10−2% for CO2, and 0.154 ± 0.157 to 0.371 ± 0.303% for CO
(see Table 3). Furthermore, providing access to proper waste
disposal programs in low-resource countries, especially in rural
areas, could mitigate the amount of waste burned domestically
and thus reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution from this
source.
Limitations of this study include a small sample size and
a short length of the data collection period for the mass of waste
generated by the participants in the Xalap´an survey. A larger
sample of households and a longer period of data collection
would provide a more reliable estimate of the average mass of
plastic waste generated and burned. Data on the mass of plastic
waste generated by each household before the workshops were
also not collected and introduced a limitation for estimating
emissions. More data are needed regarding emissions from
domestic burning of plastic waste both before and aer any
waste reduction intervention from the workshops to provide
a baseline for comparison and to assess the eﬃcacy of the
intervention. Future studies may also improve upon this study's
data collection by gathering information on corresponding
household income levels and fuel types used in order to deter-
mine whether or how these factors would aﬀect plastic waste
generation and emissions released when burning.
Another limitation is that the EFs used to calculate emis-
sions in our study were not local to Guatemala due to a lack of
studies quantifying EFs from homogeneous plastic waste
burning. More data on EFs from plastic waste burning in Gua-
temala are needed to provide more accurate local estimates.
Collecting data on the division of the mass of plastic waste
burned outdoors versus indoors would also help address this
uncertainty. The current lack of data on the mass of plastic
waste disposed of through domestic burning is also a limitation

our study faced. Our emission estimates at the city level relied
on the assumption that any waste that was not collected by
private or municipal waste collection service was burned, even
though other forms of plastic waste disposal, such as burial or
dumping in public spaces, including in bodies of water, are also
used when no formal waste collection infrastructure is avail-
able. This aspect of the calculations may have resulted in an
overestimation of emissions at the city level. Future research
would benet from direct measurements of the mass of plastic
waste burned domestically to provide more accurate estimates
of emissions that come from the domestic burning of plastic
waste.
Despite these limitations, our research has taken the rst
steps towards providing emission estimates from domestic
burning of plastic waste in Guatemala. Domestic burning of
plastic waste results in signicant emissions; lowering these
emissions by improving waste collection, particularly in low-
income countries and rural areas, will be important for
improving air quality, mitigating climate change, and reducing
adverse human health impacts.

Emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon compounds from combustion of crop residue was investigated.
Crop residues comprising maize cobs, maize husks, rice husks and bean chaff were burnt in a furnace at a tem-
perature of 400 C and the emissions from the combustion process were characterized using standard methods.
Health risk through inhalation was assessed using toxic equivalent factors and excess lifetime cancer risk. The
results showed the detection of 16 PAH compound which included: Benzo[ghi]perylene, Naphthalene, Ace-
naphthene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, Fluorene, Fluoranthene, Acenaphthylene, Pyrene, Benzo[a]anthracene,
Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene, Chrysene, Benzo[a]pyrene, Indene[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and Benzo
[k]ﬂuoranthene. Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene had highest mean concentration of 1.30 μg/mg while Dibenzo[a,h]
anthracene had the lowest mean concentration of 0.01 μg/mg. It was also revealed that the toxicity of PAHs was
due to the presence of Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene for all the samples except for sample 4 for which the main
contribution to toxicity was emission from benzo(a)pyrene, while the cancer risk assessment estimated to be 1.2 
101 was far above the acceptable carcinogenic risk limit of 1  106. This study concluded that, more efforts are
needed to reduce emission of PAHs from the combustion of crop residues into the ambient air otherwise, human
health could be under threat especially if exposed for a long period.
1. Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are compounds with two or
more bonded benzene rings and are produced when organic materials
such as wood, coal or oil undergo incompletely combustion (Vichi et al.,
2005; Haritash and Kaushik 2009; Jiang et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2016).
They are compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen, bonded in
simple ring structures to more complex ones and can either be light or
heavy (depending on the number of the rings). PAHs have been described
as harmful persistent organic pollutants; which are detrimental to the
environment and human health (Lawal, 2017). Many PAH compounds
are not only cancer-causing and poisonous for production, but they also
have potentials to cause permanent changes in the DNA sequence (Crone
and Tolstoy, 2010). Apart from the fact that they stay long in the atmo-
sphere and barely disintegrate, they are also bio-accumulative.
PAHs can be released into the atmosphere naturally or through
anthropogenic means. Natural emission sources of PAHs include hydro-
thermal processes, forest ﬁres and volcanoes, while waste or biomass
burning, burning of fossil fuel and automobile exhausts are some of the
anthropogenic sources (Li et al., 2015). Apart from these, PAHs can be
emitted from other sources. For instance, emissions from hazardous
waste sites, industries, cigarette smoking, as well as burn pits have been
identiﬁed as some of the emitters of PAHs (White et al., 2016; Lawal,
2017).
The emission of particles and all other toxic vapour pollutants
resulting from the combustion of agricultural residues is a major global

concern as it affects climate and human health (Guoliang et al., 2008). In
developing countries, burning of crop residues has become a common
practice as a means of disposal, possibly because of lack of awareness or
due to technological backwardness. Despite the fact that crop residues
left in the ﬁeld after grain harvests have great potentials as a feedstock for
bioenergy and possess nutrient, erosion, and soil carbon characteristics
that should not be ignored, many farmers in developing nations still
consider them as by-products. In developing nations, combustion of crop
residues is considered as the most suitable and economical in managing
agricultural wastes (Cheewaphongphan et al., 2011).
According to Gurjar et al. (2016), farmers practice combustion of crop
residue to dispose heaps of agricultural wastes and this operation releases
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons,
nitrogen oxide and PAHs. Apart from green-house gas emissions (CH4,
N2O, CO2), air contaminants (non-methane hydrocarbons, smoke, vola-
tile organic compounds, CO, SO2, PAHs, NOx, particulate matter, NH3),
agricultural waste burning also causes severe land and water contami-
nation at the local as well as national levels, thereby posing a danger to
public human health (Sahai et al., 2007; Gadde et al., 2009; Cheewa-
phongphan et al., 2011). Gadde et al. (2009) reported annual estimates of
concentration of air pollutants emissions from open ﬁeld combustion of
rice straws in three different countries as 16, 253, 012; 779; 144,719 and
207 Mg of CO2, CO, Total Particulate Matter (TPM) and PAHs respec-
tively, from India; 12,206,603; 290,116; 108,689 and 156 Mg of CO2,
CO,TPM and PAHs respectively, from Thailand and 11,850, 034; 281,
641; 105,514 and 151Mg of CO2, CO, TPM and PAHs respectively, from
Philippine. This is considered to increase the atmospheric pollution loads
of the respectively regions and thus severely impacts both human and
environmental of the countries.
Resulting effects of crop residues combustion can be detrimental to
both mankind and environment. For example, the short term/acute
health effects include eye irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin
irritation and inﬂammation (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016; Lawal.,
2017). The long term/chronic health effects include decreased immune
functions, cataracts, kidney and liver damage, asthma-like symptoms and
lung function abnormalities (Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016). Besides,
black soot contributes to the rise in the concentration of particulate in the
air thereby leading to poor visibility (Cheewaphongphan et al., 2011).
Likewise, generation of these vapor pollutants indirectly leads to high
concentration of ozone gases, a major contributor of air pollution. Also,
destruction of soil texture and eventual loss of soil minerals which sub-
sequently affect productivity in the subsequent cultivating years is also
one of the dangers of burning agricultural residues.
In an effort to evaluate the impacts of human related activities on the
ambient air quality, this study investigated PAHs emission from com-
bustion of agricultural waste residue. Previous studies have reported
various pollutants emitted from biomass burning along with their
resulting concentrations and possible impacts. A Study by Awasthi et al.
(2011) shows that the concentration of the different size fraction of
particulate emitted during combustion depends on the types of the
agricultural crop residue. Investigation of emissions from the combustion
of barley straw and oats by Calvo et al. (2011) shows that burning barley
straw generates more of ﬁne particles as compared to that of oats.
Emission of gaseous pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous
oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), CO, non-methane hydrocarbons, NOx, SO2,
and particulate matter (PM) were reported by Gadde et al. (2009). Impact
of the burning of rice crop residue on the levels of suspended particulate
matter (SPM), SO2 and NO2 in the ambient air of Patiala (India) was
investigated by Singh et al. (2010). The study reported that the con-
centration of SPM, SO2 and NO2 rise in rice residue combustion period
which is between September–January. Study by Shen et al. (2011)
evaluated the emission factor and size distribution of PAHs from indoor
crop residue burning in a typical rural stove. It was reported that the
PAHs emission factors from selected crop residues burnt in a typical
Chinese cooking stove were higher compared to those from experimental
chamber. In speciﬁc terms, critical review of literature revealed that
previous studies have concentrated on the assessment of emission of
inorganic pollutants generated from biomass burning but there is exis-
tence of major data gaps on PAHs emission from burning of agricultural
residues.
Generally, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have received research
attention in some developed nations due to its negative effects on envi-
ronment (Kanzari et al., 2012), animals (Qi et al., 2013) and public health
(Kannan et al., 2005). Likewise, there have been emerging research at-
tentions being given to health risk assessment of PAHs in few Asian
countries in recent years. For instance, in Southwest Iran, Doroodzani
et al. (2021) investigated effects of exposure to PAHs on pregnant women
and their fetuses. The study showed that mothers who live in industrial
areas and consume PAHs-containing foodstuffs are at high risk of trans-
mitting PAHs to the fetuses. Also, potential carcinogenic risk of exposure
to PM10-bound PAHs by residents of three major cities in Iran has also
been reported (Goudarzi et al., 2021). Several other health risk assess-
ment studies on exposure to PAHs have been carried out in China (Wang
et al., 2020), Iran (Raeisi et al., 2016; Akhbarizadeh et al., 2021) and in
Germany (Dobaradaran et al., 2019, 2020) as against dearth of reported
information on PAHs sources and levels in emergent nations, especially
African countries. Moreover, while few reported studies have focused on
PAHs present in soil from industrial and residential regions (Nieuwoudt
et al., 2011), there is a limited knowledge of the contribution of PAHs
emission from combustion of crop residue/agricultural wastes to the
ambient air quality in developing nations (Okedeyi et al., 2013).
Therefore, going by the common practice of burning, as a strategy for
disposing large heaps of agricultural wastes/residue in developing nations
and the potential of such practice to emit hydrocarbon-based pollutants
such as VOCs and PAHs, coupled with the threat that PAHs could pose to
the ambient air quality, there is the need for the assessment of these
emissions from combustion of variety of crop residues. This study inves-
tigated PAHs emissions emanating from the burning of crop residue and
their impacts on ambient air quality as well as associated health risks that
could result from exposure to the vapor emission. This study will provide
information on PAHs emission from burning of agricultural waste.
2. Methodology
2.1. Experimental set-up
The experimental set-up is furnace coupled with a thistle tube. The
furnace made up of a combustion chamber, thermostat, an ignition
source and an in-built heat exchanger. Samples were fed into the com-
bustion chamber where they were ignited by the ignition source at a
controlled temperature. The heat exchanger in the furnace absorbed heat
from the combustion process. A thistle tube loaded at the round neck/
reservoir with activated carbon (adsorbent) was tightly inserted into the
opening/vent/ﬂue collar at the top of the furnace to trap the emission
from the combustion process. The insertion was made possible by ﬁrst
passing the tube through a hole drilled in a stopper and inserting the
stopper into the ﬂue collar of the furnace. The mouth of thistle tube was
closed, air tightly with a rubber cork to prevent escape.
2.2. Experimental procedure
For this study, the crop residues (Maize cobs, Maize Husk, Rice Husks
and Beans chaff) used were collected from Landmark University Teach-
ing and Research Farm. The selected crop residues chosen represent three
major agricultural crops in Nigeria. The crop residues selected were then
dried thoroughly to remove the moisture content that may affect the rate
of combustion before being crushed to increase the surface area and
weighed. The representation of the samples is as shown in Table 1. The
pre-determined quantity of the crushed crop residues was then fed into
the furnace and burnt at a temperature of 400 C (combustion temper-
ature of the residue) while the emissions from the combustion process
was trapped in thistle tube covered with a rubber cork.

The rubber cork covered the larger end of the thistle tube. The
emission vented out was trapped from the ﬂue collar into the thistle tube
containing adsorbent (activated carbon) where the pollutants were
collected on the surface of the adsorbent in 5 min. A muslin cloth was
placed inside the thistle tube to serve as a ﬁlter medium due to its high
capacity for particle retention. The thistle tube was half-ﬁlled with
activated carbon (previously baked prior to sampling at 300 C for about
2 h to remove any trace of organic) which weighed 4g for each sample
and then sealed with a glass rod attached to a rubber cork for escape of
the emissions. The pollutants-rich-sorbent was quickly poured into a
rubber container and refrigerated before PAHs extraction, characteriza-
tion and quantiﬁcation.
2.3. Extraction of PAHs from pollutants-rich-sorbent
Extraction of PAHs for the sorbent followed method described and
employed by previous researchers (Lai et al., 2009; Sadowska-Rociek
et al., 2014), using a centrifuge (MPW 380, Germany) and T25 digital
disperser to prepare the samples. Preparation of standard solutions in
pure solvent was done for all procedures by diluting solution of the
standard mixture in hexane in the following ranges: 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 40, 70
and 100 ng mL1 and each made in triplicate, contained 100μL of
anthracene-d10 solution. For the extraction of PAHs, A standard solution
was made to cover (up to 20 μg/kg) 1 g of each sample earlier weighed
into a 50- ml centrifuge tube. This was thoroughly shaken for proper
mixing and allowed to settle for 15 min at room temperature. This was
then followed by the addition of 10 ml of hot (boiled) water to the sample
for the improvement of the yield, the solution was then cooled to ambient
temperature. After cooling was the addition of 10 ml of ethyl acetate and
vigorous shaking of the mixture for 1 min. This was followed by addition
of 1 and 4 g of NaCl and MgSO4, respectively. Apart from immediate
shaking after the addition of the salt, the tube and the contents (for each
sample) were shaken thoroughly for 1 min to ensure homogeneity, before
centrifuging at 8,700 RCF for 15 min. Into a 15 ml tube holding an
adequate amount of 0.9 g MgSO4 and tested sorbent, a 6 ml of super-
natant was transferred, the tube was then shaken for 2 min before
centrifuging at 5,000 RCF for 5 min. Extract of about 4 ml was taken into
a screw cup vial and then mixed with 100 μL of the anthracene-d10 so-
lution. Evaporation of the solvent and concentration of the extracts were
done under a stream of nitrogen. The analysis of the extracts was then
performed using GC-MS.
2.4. Quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA)
For each compound, Detection limits were estimated as three the
noise. For the calibration and spiking of the matrix, an external standard
(USA. EPA 525 PAH Mix-B) containing the 16 compounds was used. This
involves addition of a pre-known concentrations of the analytes to be
determined to the sample aliquots. Volumetric dilution was employed to
prepare the matrix spike solution form stock standards, followed by
subsequent injection on the cleaned ﬁlters. Removal efﬁciency of the
PAHs was determined by sampling the ﬂue gas containing the ﬂy ash and
the PAHs simultaneously before and after the activated carbon adsorp-
tion. The recovery efﬁciency varied between 65 and 98%. For the ﬁeld
blank, a clean ﬁlter was exposed to the same sampling environment. For
each of the ﬁve samples, two blanks were obtained. All the concentra-
tions of the PAH compounds were found to be below the limits of de-
tections of the ﬁeld blank.
2.5. PAHs characterization and quantiﬁcation
To carry out the analysis, standard methods and procedures described
by earlier researchers (Lai et al., 2009; Sadowska-Rociek et al., 2014) are
also followed in this study. Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometer
(Varian 4000) was employed. The injection was done in triplicate by
utilizing mass spectrometer of a single CP-1117 split or splitless injector
at 270 C and injection volume of 1.0 μL. Using nitrogen as a carrier gas
at 1.0 ml/min, the GC was run at these initial conditions:50 C (1.0 min)
–15 C min1 –320 C (6.0 min). The internal ionization with mas to
charge ratio from 45 to 500 was chosen as the operation mode for the ion
trap mass spectrometer, setting the ionization ﬁlament dwell time to 80

qualitatively analyzed in the selected ion monitoring mode at 8.0 min
solvent delay and 220 and 180 C as transfer line and trap temperatures,
respectively.
2.6. Health impact assessment
The three major routes through which humans are exposed to emis-
sions of PAH compounds include ingestion, dermal and inhalation
(Edokpayi et al., 2016). In man, the harmful effects of PAH are largely
dependent on the route of exposure (Diggs et al., 2011). The most sig-
niﬁcant health impact to be expected from its inhalational exposure is an
excess risk of lung cancer (Kim et al., 2013). Its exposure may also pose a
risk for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension,
thrombosis and myocardial infarction (Holme et al., 2019). In this study,
health risk through inhalation contact route was also estimated. With the
knowledge that each of PAH compounds has varying degree of carcino-
genic effects, therefore to assess the risk of PAH mixture and at the same
time, guide against overestimation of the cancer-causing (carcinogenic)
risk, two approaches were employed. These approaches are toxicity po-
tential using toxic equivalent factors (TEFs) and excess lifetime cancer
risk. The toxicity potential was employed for the ﬁve samples while
excess lifetime cancer risk was used for PAH mixture using the mean
concentration.

An estimate of the Toxicity potential of PAHs was made based on the
most carcinogenic PAH compound-benzo[a]pyrene, using Eq. (1) (Simon
et al., 2012; Nekhavhambe et al., 2014, Edokpayi et al., 2016).
PTEQ ¼ TEFi  PCi

Ci ¼ concentration level of individual PAH compound;
TEQ ¼ toxic equivalent quotient,
TEFi ¼ toxic equivalent factor relative to benzo[a]pyrene.
TEFs used were obtained from US EPA (2010) and Nekhavhambe
et al. (2014).
According to previous reports, health risk assessment can also be
estimated for inhalation contact route using excess lifetime cancer risk
(ELCR) (Wu et al., 201; Odekanle et al., 2020). Excess lifetime cancer risk
is given by Eq. (2) (Wu et al., 2014)

3. Results and discussion
In the ﬁve samples analysed, 16 PAHs were characterized using the
data from the chromatographic analyses with an MS Detector. The
compounds detected included; Benzo[ghi]perylene, Naphthalene, Ace-
naphthene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, Fluorene, Fluoranthene, Ace-
naphthylene,
Pyrene,
Benzo[a]anthracene,
Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene,
Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene,
Chrysene,
Benzo[a]pyrene,
Indene[1,2,3-cd]
pyrene and Benzo[k]ﬂuoranthene. Summarized in Table 2 are the con-
centrations (μg/mg) of PAHs in the 5 samples. The characterized PAHs
had varying concentrations ranging from 1.47 to 0.01 ug/mg. Ace-
naphthylene and Phenanthrene were not detected for sample 4, Benzo
[ghi]perylene was not detected for Sample 3 while Dibenzo[ah]anthra-
cene was not detected for samples 1,2,3, 5 (though with a very low
concentration of 0.010 μg/mg for sample 4). The differences in the PAHs
composition between the different samples were found to be statistically
signiﬁcant at 95 % conﬁdence interval (p < 0.05) (Table 3).
The difference in the emission source may be responsible for the PAHs
composition (Wang et al., 2020). The Mean concentration for each
characterized PAHs was presented in Figure 1. Generally, PAHs with
lower molecular weights were present in lower concentrations than those
with higher molecular weights (except for the case of Dibenzo[a,h]
anthracene with a mean concentration of 0.010 μg/mg). Benzo[b]ﬂuo-
ranthene and Chrysene were present in higher concentrations (1.300 and
0.938 μg/mg respectively) when compared with other PAHs detected.
Dibenzo [a,h] anthracene (0.01 μg/mg) and Naphthalene (0.052 μg/mg)
are the two PAHs with lowest mean concentration. Of all the 16 PAH

compounds characterized, only Naphthalene, Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene
and Benzo[(a]pyrene have their mean concentrations below the 0.200
ug/mg limit set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA). This indicates that, human health could be under threat espe-
cially if exposed for a long period. It is thought that high molecular
weight PAHs were more prevalent due to their increased weight which
makes them resistant to oxidation, reduction and vaporization. The re-
sults obtained in this study were higher than most reported data by
previous studies (Dhammapala et al., 2007, Lu et al., 2009, Shen et al.,
2011) but comparable to the report of Simon et al. (2012). The difference
could be linked to the variations in the experimental set-up. Generally,
PAH emissions strongly depend on the fuel type and burning conditions
which include the combustion chamber as well as the combustion tem-
perature (Simon et al., 2012). Previous studies reported results obtained
from chamber experiment while this study is based on laboratory
experiment where air ﬂow and oxygen supply are more limited, hence
reduced combustion efﬁciency and elevated PAHs concentrations.
Similarly, it is thought that combustion temperature (400 C) in this
study favoured PAHs formation due to limited heat loss during the
combustion.
It has been reported that the higher the combustion temperature
from 200 to 700 C, the higher the emission of PAHs (Shen et al., 2011).
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 3 and 4 rings PAHs accounted
for between 29% and 34% of the emissions, while those with 5 and 6
rings accounted for between 10% and 26% whereas, PAHs with only 2
rings are accounted for less than 1% of the emission. The mass frag-
mentations of the characterized PAHs were shown in Figure 2(a-d). The
mass to charge ratio (m/z) ranged from 178 to 276. As the number of
the rings of molecule increased, there was also a progressive increase in
the mass to charge ratios of the compounds with Naphthalene and
Dibenzo[a,h]anthracene having the lowest and highest m/z ratio
respectively.
Several factors such as the emitted concentration, meteorological
conditions (temperature, windspeed, wind direction) and atmospheric
oxidants determine the potential emission sources of PAH compounds
(Wu et al., 2014). However, several previous studies have employed the
use of diagnostic ratios for PAHs source identiﬁcation (Brandli et al.,
2007; Yang et al., 2007; Nasher et al., 2013). It has also been suggested
that diagnostic ratios are designed to identify PAHs sources due to their
stability, chemical and physical properties (Yunker et al., 2002; Nasher
et al., 2013). Generally, PAHs emission can either be from petroleum
origin (petrogenic source) or from the combustion of biomass (pyrogenic
sources). This was assessed and ascertained using the most commonly
adopted characteristic diagnostic ratio values for particular emission
sources (Table 4).
The ratio of Anthracene/(Anthracene þ Phenanthrene) was 0.37
(>0.1), while that of Fluoranthene/(Fluoranthene þ Pyrene) was 0.51
(>0.4) and the ratio of Low molecular weight/High molecular weight
gave 0.5 (<1). This was a conﬁrmation of the pyrogenic source of the
PAHs. Most PAHs in ambient air are usually from the combustion of
biomass rather than petroleum origin (Edokpayi et al., 2016).
3.1. Health risk assessment
The potential toxicity of individual PAHs was presented in Table 5.
The ECLR was estimated to be 1.2  101. The toxicity of PAHs was due
to the presence of Benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene for all the samples except for
sample 4 for which the main contribution to toxicity was emission from
benzo[a]pyrene. Though there are emissions from light PAHs, their
contribution to global toxicity could be assumed to be minor. Similarly,
the inhalation risk (ECLR) calculated as 1.2  101 was higher than the
generally accepted carcinogenic risk level of 1  106.
Inhalation risks less than or equal to 1  106 are considered as being
negligible or insigniﬁcant risks (Wu et al., 2014). This estimation in-
dicates that more efforts are needed to reduce emission of PAHs from the
combustion of crop residues.

4. Conclusion
The analysis of the emission from the combustion of the selected crop
residues for PAH compounds revealed 16 PAH compounds with varying
concentrations. PAHs with lower molecular weights were present in
lower concentrations than those with higher molecular weights. Health
risk assessment also showed an elevated level beyond the acceptable
carcinogenic threshold limit. Hence, continual exposure to the emission
from these sources could endanger public health. Thus, public awareness
and education on the sources and health impacts of exposure need to be
improved. It is therefore concluded that more efforts are needed to
reduce emission of PAHs from the combustion of crop residues into the
ambient air.

Villagers residing in areas with rice farms are exposed to smoke from burning of agricultural waste that
may affect respiratory health. To assess respiratory effects of this smoke-induced air pollution, a cross-
sectional study has been conducted in three randomly selected villages of Isfahan rural areas. A physician-
administered health questionnaire was completed for 433 male and 561 female villagers aged 1–80 years,
followed by physical examinations and spirometry in symptomatic cases, before and after a rice burning
episode in October 2000. Total particulate and respirable particulate maters (PM10) was doubled during
burning episode. Prevalence rates for respiratory symptoms before smoke were: recent asthma attacks
(7.7%), using asthma medications (3%), sleep disturbed by dyspnea and cough (7.4%), exercise-induced
cough (13.3%), which increased to 9.5, 7.1, 9.3 and 17%, respectively. Mean initial values (as percent of
prediction) for; FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEFR, and FEF25–75 were: 85.9 ± 22.7, 81.7 ±8, 86.2 ±26.2 and
60 ± 26.4, respectively. The mentioned values decreased to to 83.2 ± 19.5, 76.5 ± 10.3, 85.5 ± 21.1 and
54.3 ± 26.4, respectively. All of the clinical and spirometric changes were statistically significant. Study
findings suggest increased respiratory morbidity associated with rice burning episodes among all people
living in the area.

Introduction
Acute smoke inhalation as a result of fires is a major problem in urban areas (American
Academy of Pediatrics 2000) and has been well studied during the last two decades. Acute
exposure to heat, particulate matter (soot), and gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen
cyanide can result in respiratory tract burning, asphyxia, and poisoning (Haponic 1993). Chronic
exposure to air pollution, especially in larger cities, which is usually related to the internal
combustion engine (Steerenberg et al. 2001) is also known, and its deleterious effects on the
tracheobronchial tree and resultant disorders have been frequently studied all over the world.
Severe structural and functional impairments both in the upper (Caldern-Garcidueas et al. 2001)
and lower (Tzankis et al. 2001) respiratory tract are recorded in those exposed to air pollution.
126
Golshan et al.
Both short-term (Schindler et al. 2001; Smith et al. 2000), and long-term (Mukae et al. 2001;
Pauwels et al. 2001) exposures can induce clinical and/or functional respiratory impairments.
However, subacute smoke inhalation, which usually happens to those living in the neighborhood
of fires, not close enough to be grossly injured, have been seldom discussed (McCurdy et al.
1996; Jacobs et al. 1997; Long et al. 1998).
Every October in Isfahan after harvesting the rice farms, farmers burn the rice residues (straw
and stubble) to prevent the growth of insect larvae. The serial burning in the area lasts for a few
weeks. At these times, a thick cloud of smoke covers the fields and households of a large area
in the villages, close to Isfahan suburbs, which potentially can injure the respiratory tract of the
healthy inhabitants, and more obviously aggravate the pre-existing respiratory disorders.
The purpose of this study is to compare the respiratory health status of the inhabitants of the
villages of the rice farms before and after burning the rice residues, to elucidate the possible
respiratory risk of this kind of sub-acute smoke inhalation.
Subjects and methods
The Committee for Medical Ethics at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved the
protocols and methods.
Assuming a 5% prevalence rate of airways diseases in the population, 680 people residing in
the area were estimated to be sufficient for the study. Three of the 78 villages found in the map
of the area were randomly selected for the study. All people living in these three villages were
considered to be enrolled in the study. When these three villages were visited, the actual total
population was 1,127 individuals who were all included in the group.
A four-step approach was used for the survey. For the first step, four interns of Isfahan
Medical School attended the villages, visited all houses, and asked all people living in the
houses to come to local public health office for a free medical interview and physical
examinations. Since many of the family members may not have been home at first visit, they
repeated the visits on several occasions and at different times to see all members. The medical
interview and physical examinations were performed by interns. To make uniform interviews
and medical recordings the interns used a popular respiratory questionnaire (Fishman et al.
1998) as the backbone of the interview.
For the second step, those participants complaining of respiratory symptoms, and/or having
evidence of airway diseases other than recent colds, were referred to the pulmonary clinic of St.
Zahra Medical Center for a free visit with a pulmonolgist and a routine spirometry if the subject
was co-operative enough to perform the standard maneuvers. At this second stage, 134 subjects
were invited.
Spirometric parameters that were recorded for comparisons included: forced vital capacity
(FVC), forced expiratory flow in the first second of expiration (FEV1), the ratio of FVC/FEV1,
peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and mean expiratory flow rate at middle half of expiration
(FEF 25–75).
One hundred and six cases completed the second stage. The response rate for the second stage
was 79%.
Steps one and two were completed during August and September 2000.
The amount of air-suspended particulate maters (PM10) in 14 randomly selected outdoor loci
in the area were measured, both before and a few weeks later, during the active phase of burning
process. PM10 dust measurements were performed using Teflon filters of 37 mm diameter and
1 mm pore size, and three pieces cassette holder connected to a personal sampling pump (SKC,

model 224-PXR3) operating at a flow rate of 1.5 l/min. Respirable dust samples were collected
using a 10-mm Dorr-olive cyclone on series with 37-mm Teflon filters and the above pump at
a flow rate of 1.7 l/min. The mass of dust in all samples was determined gravimetrically.
One week after completion of the latest burns, all of the procedures of the first two steps were
repeated to complete the study.
In the fourth step, all of the stage two cases and also newly symptomatic persons were invited
for interview and spirometry. However, pulmonary function test or auscultation comparisons were
applicable only in those with a set of two spirometries and/or two physical examinations.
Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in one patient with cough and hemoptysis
after a burn episode, which showed a mild increase in cell population of the lavage fluid with
26% lymphocytes and 8% neutrophils.
The findings were collected in a database and analyzed by the statistical package for the social
sciences (SPSS for Windows, ver 10.05, SPSS Chicago, IL). Dependent samples t-test was used
to compare nominal or categorical variables. Numerical variables were compared using compare
means of the package.
Multivariate analysis was used to determine the association of post-pollution symptoms with
previous histories of respiratory illnesses and also air pollution.
Results
Of the initially invited 1,127 inhabitants of the area, 994 (88.2%) accepted enrolment in the
study. The major reason for refusal was having no time to come to the clinic.
The final subjects who successfully completed the first stage of the study comprised 561

433 
male 
subjects, 
ranging 
in 
age 
from 
1month 
to

(Mean ± SD = 25.2 ± 17.5). The data available from the initial, phase one interview suggested
that a higher proportion of non-responders (n = 105/133) were male. Response rates for male and
females in first phase were 80.5 and 95.2%, respectively.
In the second stage, the 28 non-responders were generally less symptomatic (as judged by the
initial phase one interview) than were responders. For example, the prevalence of wheeze or
whistle in the chest in the last 12 months was 11.3% in the non-responders in comparison with
42.3% in the responders (P < 0.0001).

The response rates for stages 3 and 4 were 87.8 and 79%, respectively, which are close to the
first two stages.
The study population, according to demographic factors, smoking status and number of
subjects satisfactorily completing pulmonary function testing, is presented in Table 1.
Nearly all of the women were housewives also involved in farm jobs, with 10 teachers, three
hairdressers, and four tailors in the group.
Most of the men were farmers; however, many of them were also involved in small industrial
and/or clerical jobs and office services in the area. Unfortunately many of the recorded men’s
extra job titles were poorly defined and could not disclose the possible pulmonary risks. So they
were not used for risk estimations.
The frequency of respiratory disorders and related symptoms in stages 1 and 2, and changes
observed after burning of the residues (stages 3 and 4) are summarized in Table 2.
In the second stage, only 79 of the 134 invited cases (58.9%) underwent pulmonary function
testing, others (mostly young children) were unable to perform satisfactory forced vital capacity

maneuvers. Fortunately all of these 79 were able to complete the later two stages, and fairly
analyzable data were collected.
The main parameters of spirometric recordings of the 79 cases (Mean ±SD) before and after
burning the residues are summarized in Table 3.
Most of the new sufferers of dyspneal attacks, and night dyspnea and/or cough, as recorded
in stages 3 and 4 of the study, had previous histories of similar conditions; however, two toddlers
experienced wheezy respiratory illness for the first time in life in these smoke exposure days.
In multivariate analysis, recent wheezy dyspneal attacks and night sleep disturbance due to
respiratory symptoms after burning episode were significantly associated with previous histories
of: cigarette smoking (P < 0.01), chronic bronchitis (P < 0.05), asthma (P = 0.007) or related
symptoms (P < 0.01–0.001).
The results of particulate matter (PM10) measurements are included in Table 4.
Discussion
Smoke inhalation is an important cause of acute lung injury in humans and is associated with
a high mortality rate (Laffon et al. 1999). Smoke inhalation affects both pulmonary endothelial
and epithelial barriers (Laffon et al. 1999).
A large number of the lower-molecular weight constituents of smoke are toxic to the
bronchial mucosa and alveoli because of their physical and/or chemical properties, or their
ability to form free radicals. Examples include ammonia, aldehydes, chlorine, hydrogen
chloride, SO2, NO, NO2, phosgene and many other known or even unknown agents (Haponic
et al. 1988). The smoke constituents when inhaled in sufficient concentrations tend to produce
acute neutrophilic airway inflammation associated with symptoms consisting of cough,
bronchorrhea, dyspnea and wheezing (Laffon et al. 1999), the symptoms may appear early or
with a significant delay after exposure (Haponic et al. 1988). Increased alveolo-capillary
permeability, impaired lymphatic flow (Laffon et al. 1999), and pulmonary edema may also
ensue after heavy exposures (Soejima et al. 2001).
However, repeated exposures to lower concentrations of smoke may not induce acute injuries
and can contribute to development of chronic respiratory illnesses including asthma (Kinsella et
al. 1991), chronic bronchitis and COPD (Pauwels et al. 2001).
Subacute smoke inhalation with borderline concentrations can result in both; acute respiratory
derangement and prepare the victims to develop chronic respiratory illness. In a previous survey
in Canada, deleterious effects of smoke arising from burning agricultural residues had been
observed on aggravation of previous respiratory symptoms of patients suffering COPD (Long et
al. 1998). However, they did not elucidate the possible effects on respiratory health of
asymptomatic inhabitants in the area.

In the present study, randomly selected people were enrolled and classic medical interviews
were carried out, from which the responses to respiratory questions were extracted and the
involved interns completed the questionnaires in all stages. Therefore, the answers recorded in
the questionnaires are more likely to represent the facts.
As seen in Tables 2 and 3, significant increases both in the number of symptomatic cases and
the severity of the previous disorders, as reflected in reduced FEV1 and FEF25–75 of the
symptomatic cases, can be observed. These data confirm that exposure to smoke produced by
burning agricultural residues induces pulmonary symptoms in previously asymptomatic
inhabitants, possibly due to acute inflammation of airways, and also can aggravate previous
symptoms in susceptible patients. The latter finding looks more obvious, since symptomatic
individuals are more likely to seek medical assistance, but late morbidities associated with
repeating exposures of uncomplaining persons to such contaminated air have been frequently
reported (Long et al. 1998; Dow et al. 1999; Gold et al. 2000), and should be of concern for
communities and physicians, especially in developing countries.
Significant increases in suspended particulate maters (PM10) were recorded in the ambient air
in the area during the burning episode (Table 2), which seems to be responsible for the observed
pulmonary symptoms.
The findings of the present study are in accord with previous reports on the deleterious
pulmonary effects of smoke induced by burning of agricultural residues or biomass fuels used
in developing countries (Bruce et al. 2000; Gold et al. 2000).
A recent study has established that the burning agricultural or forest residues can expose local
communities to relatively high levels of pollutants (Reinhardt et al. 2001).This high level of air
pollution does not remain local and confined to nearby areas; it can affect places many
kilometers away from the burning sources (Lelieveld et al. 2001).
There is evidence confirming that prolonged subacute exposure to biomass smoke can induce
chronic pulmonary parenchymal (Amoli 1998; gold et al. 2000), and/or chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (Bruce et al. 2000).
Conclusions
Air pollution associated with the burning of agricultural residues is capable of aggravating pre-
existing dyspnea, cough, night cough, night chest discomfort and exercise-induced cough in
patients with chronic respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, smoke exposure can induce all of the
above-mentioned symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects. Also, obstructive spirometric
patterns are more often recorded after smoke exposure.

Open dumping and burning of solid waste are widely practiced in underserved communities lacking access
to solid waste management facilities; however, the generation of microplastics from these sites has been
overlooked. We report elevated concentrations of microplastics (MPs) in soil of three solid waste open
dump and burn sites: a single-family site in Tuttle, Oklahoma, USA, and two community-wide sites in
Crow Agency and Lodge Grass, Montana, USA. We extracted, quantiﬁed, and characterized MPs from
two soil depths (0–9 cm and 9–18 cm). The average of abundance of particles found at community-
wide sites three sites (18, 460 particles kg−1 soil) equals or exceeds reported concentrations from
currently understood sources of MPs including biosolids application and other agricultural practices.
Attenuated total reﬂectance Fourier transformed infrared (ATR-FTIR) identiﬁed polyethylene as the
dominant polymer across all sites (46.2–84.8%). We also detected rayon (#11.5%), polystyrene (up to
11.5%), polyethylene terephthalate (#5.1), polyvinyl chloride (#4.4%), polyester (#3.1), and acrylic (#2.2%).
Burned MPs accounted for 76.3 to 96.9% of the MPs found in both community wide dumping sites.
These results indicate that solid waste dumping and burning activities are a major source of thermally
oxidized MPs for the surrounding terrestrial environment with potential to negatively aﬀect underserved
communities.
Environmental signicance
Our work determined the quantity and vertical distribution of microplastics (MPs) in soil surrounding open dumping and burning sites. This work unveils the
abundance of MPs in the terrestrial environment around open dumpling and open burning sites near underserved communities. Generation of MPs through
open dumping and burning of solid waste is an issue concerning not only our partner communities for this study in Oklahoma and Montana, but also globally,
and has profound environmental implications for rural and urban underserved communities worldwide.

Introduction
Human activities generated about 242 million metric tons of
solid waste in 2016 according to the World Bank.1 Plastic waste
represents about 12.2% of the solid waste of the United States of
America (US)2 and 12% around the world.1 In the specic case of
the US, such estimation disregards rubber or synthetic polymer
based textiles as part of the plastic waste as these wastes are
grouped under the rubber, leather, and textiles category.2
Waste disposal practices are a function of each country's
economy.1,3 In high income countries, most of the waste is
either landlled (39% of the total waste), recycled (29%), or
incinerated (22%). Low income countries, on the other hand,
dispose about 93% of their waste in open dump sites.1 Open

dumping is also prevalent in isolated and unserved communi-
ties even in upper middle- and high-income countries.
In the US, some rural communities and isolated Native
American Tribes lack access to waste collection services and
management facilities and, as a result, rely upon open burning
to dispose of solid waste.3,4 About 18–29 million metric tons of
plastic waste was burned in 2016.3,5 Though burning solid waste
disposed in open pits may reduce waste volume, pathogen
exposure,3 and undesirable odor, the sites lack protective
barriers and result in refuse placed directly above the ground.6
Open dumping and burning of solid waste are well-known
sources of suspended particulate matter, odorous compounds,
and leachates among other pollutants.3,7
Open dumping and burning sites are also an unexplored
source of terrestrial microplastics (MPs, plastic pieces with
a size between 1 mm and 5 mm.8 It is likely that open burning
sites generate MPs due to the lack of temperatures that are
suﬃcient or consistent enough to incinerate plastic waste,
which represents between 6.4 and 13% of the solid waste.1
Partially-combusted plastics generated from these burning
processes have more potential to generate MPs relative to non-
oxidized plastics. Other types of oxidized MPs (e.g., UV oxidized)
have shown increased toxicity,9 sorption capacity,10,11 brittle-
ness,12 and leaching capacity of additives13–15 among other
eﬀects. This highlights the importance of considering not only
MP quantity and plastic type, but also the MP functional and
surface chemistry.16,17
Compared to aquatic ecosystems, the current understanding
of sources and levels of MP pollution in terrestrial ecosystems is
limited.18–21 Common sources of MPs in soils include improper
disposal of domestic and industrial waste, urban and rural
runoﬀ, wet and dry deposition, and biosolids.22,23 However, even
less research has been conducted to understand the abundance
and type of MPs in soils due to open dumping and burning of
solid waste, which is a common waste disposal practice in
underserved rural communities.1,3,24–27 Thus far, these few
studies agree on microplastic occurrence28,29 in a range of 50 to
1110 items kg−1.30
Our work determined the abundance and vertical distribu-
tion of MPs in soil surrounding open dumping and burning
sites at a single-family open burning site located in Tuttle,
Oklahoma
(Tuttle
burn
site),
and
two
Native
American
community-wide sites in Crow Agency, Montana (Crow Agency
burn site and Lodge Grass dump site). We identied the poly-
mer type and functional chemistry of MPs and trends in MPs
abundance, polymer size, and surface chemistry in relation to
soil physiochemical characteristics, depth, and site history and
use. Few studies have examined the occurrence of MPs in waste
disposal sites, and even fewer have considered the surrounding
soils.3,4,27–30 Microplastics generated from open burning sites
likely show diﬀerent oxidation patterns than other MPs found
in the environment that have been generated from other
weathering processes. Our study assesses the abundance of MPs
near open dumping and open burning sites in underserved
communities and analyzes the functional chemistry of MPs
with a thermal oxidation signature; and it highlights the
importance of understanding MP contamination aﬀecting
underserved communities which are frequently overlooked in
mainstream science.

Methods
2.1
Quality assurance and quality control
To reduce MP contamination during laboratory procedures, all
glassware was sonicated for 30 min in deionized (DI) water and
covered with aluminum foil until use. All procedures except for
elutriation and uorescence microscopy were conducted in
a designated MP laboratory which had extra air ltration units
and regular rigorous cleaning of surfaces. All applicable
procedures were conducted in a laminar ow fume hood. Lab
coats made of 100% cotton were worn during all laboratory
procedures and synthetic clothing was avoided as much as
possible during sampling. A triplicate laboratory control was
conducted to detect lab-based contamination. To account for
base-level
environmental
MP
contamination,
background
samples were collected and run in triplicate. The background
for the Tuttle burn site was a eld in nearby Stillwater, OK, and
the background for Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass
dump site was adjacent ranch land. No prior dumping or
burning was reported in any of these background sites.
2.2
Site characterization and sample collection
Faculty of Little Big Horn Community College, Crow Agency, MT,
identied ‘Crow Agency burn site’ and ‘Lodge Grass dump site’,
which serve approximately 2000 and 440 people, respectively.
Homeowners of Tuttle, OK, identied the burn site which serves
two people. Faculty and the homeowners described current solid
waste management practices. The approximate area of each site
was determined using Google Earth. The area of the Tuttle burn
site was approximately 50 m2. The areas of the Crow Agency burn
site and Lodge Grass dump site were approximately 32 200 m2 and
36 000 m2, respectively (Table S1†). Aerial images and sampling
coordinates are available in Fig. S1 and Table S3.† Partners from
Little Big Horn Community College reported that solid waste
burning occurred regularly at the Tuttle burn site and Crow Agency
burn site, while primarily dumping without burning occurred at
Lodge Grass dump site. The Tuttle burn site has been in use for
about 30 years, while Crow Agency burn site and Lodge Grass
dump site began only about 2 years prior to the sampling date.
The trash piles were not homogenous; thus, sites were
divided into quadrants (based on cardinal directions) to
account for variation in soil or MP characteristics. Samples were
collected in a randomized design, and samples were taken with
two diﬀerent purposes: (1) we collected a bulk sample to ∼18 cm
in depth using a shovel to determine texture and organic matter
content; and (2) we collected soil from ∼0 to 9 and 9 to 18 cm
depths using a 2.54 cm diameter soil probe to evaluate MP size
and content distribution. Bulk and core samples were taken
from the same quadrants. Approximations in sample depth
were due to varied compaction levels across the sampling areas
which at times physically limited the depth to which the probe
could be driven into the soil. Three sampling locations were
selected randomly within each quadrant of the pile. Subsamples

were collected from each location and combined to obtain
approximately ∼1 kg of soil per composite sample, providing
four replicate soil samples per site. Samples were collected in
3.78 L new and clean plastic sealable bags to retain moisture
during transport and were refrigerated upon arrival at the
laboratory. The bulk samples were used for soil texture and
organic matter analyses and the 0–9 cm and 9–18 cm probe
samples were used for MP analyses.
2.3
Soil characterization & preparation
The bulk and probe samples were each passed through
a 4.75 mm sieve for homogenization then dried at 50 °C over-
night. This drying temperature was chosen to prevent thermal
oxidization of MPs in samples. Bulk samples were sent to the
Oklahoma State University Soil, Water, Forage Analytical
Laboratory for texture analysis using the hydrometer method.31
The organic matter content of bulk samples was determined
with a loss on ignition procedure in a subset of each sample that
was not used for MP analyses.32 Texture and organic matter
characterization and area information are provided in the ESI
le (Table S1).†

Microplastic extraction
Microplastic extractions from the 0–9 cm and 9–18 cm soil
samples of each quadrant were performed in triplicate. For each
replicate, 10 g of dry soil was elutriated following the procedure
outlined in Forsythe et al.33 to remove dense non-plastic mate-
rial from the sample. Briey, 10 g of dry soil was sonicated in DI
water to break up aggregates, then elutriated in a column for
15 min using an upow velocity of 1.3 cm s−1. Particles with
a lower settling velocity were captured in a 45 mm eﬄuent
collection sieve. Particles in the sieve were rinsed into a glass
beaker with water for transport to the designated MP laboratory.
At the MP laboratory, the water-particle slurry was ltered
through a 20 mm stainless steel mesh using a glass lter unit.
Particles retained on the mesh were rinsed into a 250 mL glass
Erlenmeyer ask with 150 mL of 7.5% w/w NaOCl for digestion.
Erlenmeyer asks were secured on an incubator shaker table at
300 rpm at 50 °C for 24 h. Aer this, digestate was ltered
through a 20 mm stainless steel mesh using a glass lter unit.
Retained particles were thoroughly rinsed with DI water, then
rinsed into 15 mL falcon tubes using 5.1 M ZnCl2 (∼693 g L−1)
for a density separation procedure.34 Falcon tubes were vortexed
then centrifuged at ∼12 300 ms−2 for 5 min. The supernatant
was ltered onto a 20 mm stainless steel mesh, and tubes were
relled with ZnCl2 and vortexed until the pellet was resus-
pended and well-mixed. This procedure was repeated until each
falcon tube had been centrifuged and the supernatant ltered
three times. The particles retained from the supernatant were
rinsed thoroughly with DI water, then rinsed onto a 13 mm
diameter 2 mm pore size Al2O3 lter for MPs analyses using
a glass ltration unit.
2.5
Particle quantication and size analysis
The particle quantication and size analyses were performed
according to Quiambao et al.35 and details of the method are
available in the ESI.† Briey, extracted particles were imaged
with a stereomicroscope (AmScope 7X-180X Trinocular Zoom
Stereo Microscope) as initial visual identication using Al2O3
lters. Each Al2O3 lter was placed in a clean glass Petri dish
and dyed with ∼30 mL of 2 mg Nile Red per mL methanol solu-
tion for uorescence microscopy analyses. Particles were leto
react with the dye for 10 min then rinsed with 200 mL of ACS
grade ethanol on a glass ltration stack to remove excess dye.
Filters were placed in a Greiner 6-well plate and imaged with
a uorescence microscope (Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi Mode
Reader, Agilent Technologies) using an RFP lter cube (excita-
tion 531 nm/emission 593 nm). Gen5® soware was used for
imaging, which allowed us to obtain a single stitched image of
each lter from a series of 4x magnication images (Tables S6–
S9†). The resolution limit of Cytation 5 cell Imaging at this
magnication is about 15 mm pixel−1. Each image was pre-
processed to reduce background uorescence. Microplastics
were quantied by running the stitched image through the
MPVAT 2.0 macros using ImageJ.36 To avoid over-quantication
caused by the 15 mm pixel−1 limit of the Cytation, particles
smaller than 40 mm were excluded from quantication and only
the lter ow-through area was considered. Stereomicroscope
and uorescence microscope images are found in Tables S6–
S9.†

using
Attenuated

Fourier
Transform
Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR, Thermo Nicolet iN10 MX)
which has a detection limit of 20 mm. One representative lter
from each triplicate was selected for ATR-FTIR analysis. Ten
percent of the suspected plastic particles identied during
uorescence quantication were analyzed with m ATR-FTIR;
a minimum of ve particles were required for all lters
regardless of MP count and a maximum cap was set at 15
particles due to lengthy analysis time. In total, 59 particles were
examined from Tuttle burn site, 110 from Crow Agency burn
site, and 120 from Lodge Grass dump site. Each lter was
mounted on a gold mirror slide and a mosaic image of the lter
ow-through area was acquired with OMNIC Picta® soware to
aid in the selection of particles. ATR-FTIR measurements were
collected with a cooled detector and Germanium tip, 51 s
collection time with 256 scans, spectral range of 4000–675 cm−1
and a resolution of 8 cm−1. Aperture size was adapted to t each
examined particle. The resulting spectra were searched against
the OMNIC Picta® stock polymer libraries (HR Polymer Addi-
tives and Plasticizers, Hummel Polymer Sample Library, Poly-
mer Laminate Films, and Synthetic Fibers by Microscope) and
an
in-house
generated
library
which
included
thermally
oxidized plastic spectra described below (Table S2†). An in-
house library was generated by adding the ATR spectra of
common consumer plastics (bottles, wrappers. containers)
which were thermally oxidized in an oven at 100, 200, and 300 °
C for 1, 8, and 48 h. Prior to oxidation all materials were care-
fully cleaned. The library was also augmented with UV oxidized

plastics. Using the procedure by Yang et al.,37 a particle match
>70% was automatically considered plastic. A match between
60–70% required manual visual comparison against the library
polymer spectrum and was interpreted based on similarities in
absorption peaks. Any match under 60% was not considered
a plastic.

Pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
Soil samples were prepared for Pyrolysis gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) following the methodology
explained in the section 2.3 Soil Characterization and Prepara-
tion of this manuscript.33 Briey, samples were weighed out
between 1–2 mg on an ultra-balance (EPE26 Precision Balance,
Mettler Toledo). Analysis was conducted with an EGA/PY-3030D
pyrolysis unit (Frontier Labs, Koriyama, Japan) attached to an
Agilent 6890 GC/5975 MS system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA).
Quantication
was
performed
following
the
method
of
described by Forsythe et al.,33 and all measured masses were
normalized to the original sample mass to give units of mg
(plastics) to g (dry soil)−1.

Data analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in Minitab Statistical
Soware 22® and MicrosoExcel®. Outliers were determined
by Grubb's test, and outliers were excluded from further anal-
ysis. All sample groups were then tested for normality using
a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Samples from Lodge Grass, Crow
Agency, and Tuttle were compared to the lab control and their
corresponding
background
points,
and
diﬀerences
were
assessed for each site between depths and locations. One-way
ANOVA and unpaired t-tests were performed to determine the
signicance of observed diﬀerences.

Results and discussion
3.1
Open dumping and burning sites contribute to
microplastic pollution
Particle abundance: both community-wide open dump and
open burn sites contributed signicantly (p < 0.05, Table S21†)
to environmental contamination. The highest particle abun-
dance was detected in the Lodge Grass dump site with a mean
of 17 900 particles kg−1 in the 0–9 cm prole and 24 000 parti-
cles kg−1 in the 9–18 cm prole (Fig. 1A). In the Crow Agency
site, the mean particle abundance was 14 700 particles kg−1 in
the 0–9 cm prole and 17 200 particles kg−1 in the 9–18 cm
prole. Our data also indicate that the community-wide open
dumping and burning sites contained a signicantly higher
abundance (p < 0.05, Table S21†) of particles compared to the
single-family site (Fig. 1). At all three sites, the highest MP count
was observed in the 9–18 cm soil depth though they show no
signicant diﬀerences (p-value 0.05, Table S21†).
The abundance of particles at the three sites is equivalent to
or exceeds reported concentrations from currently understood
key sources of terrestrial MPs including biosolids application
and other agricultural practices.38,39 For example, biosolids can
contain up to 14 000 items kg−1, and concentrations higher
than 5190 particles kg−1 soil have been found in biosolids-
applied agricultural elds.40,41 A range from 900 to 40 800
items kg−1 soil was found in agricultural soils in Yunnan
Province, China – the abundance attributed in part to plastic
mulching.42 The high concentration of particles detected at the
Tuttle burn site, Crow Agency burn site, and Lodge Grass dump
site evidenced that open dumping and burning of solid waste
are a key source of terrestrial MP pollution, especially in the
rural and underserved communities that must utilize the
practice.
The quantity of particles detected in each replicate (analyt-
ical replicate made from each composite) of all quadrants at
Tuttle burn site, Crow Agency burn site, and Lodge Grass dump
site is shown in Table S4,† respectively. Quantication at
background sites and in lab controls is found in Table S5.†
Stereomicroscopy and uorescence microscopy for all sites,
background, and lab controls are shown in Tables S6–S9.†
Particle size: the average size of particles found at Crow
Agency site was 228.4 ± 136.97 and 226.8 ± 117.30 mm for the 0–
9 cm and 9–18 cm cores, respectively (Fig. 1D). At the Lodge
Grass site, the average size was 224.3 ± 128.73 and 263.9 ±
187.11 mm for the 0–9 cm and 9–18 cm cores, respectively
(Fig. 1E). Finally, the Tuttle site contained particles with an
average size of 224.5 ± 106.99 and 191.8 ± 84.72 mm (Fig. 1F).
The wide range of particle size (126.4–1872.8 mm) highlights the
heterogenicity of particle sizes found in these sites. Smaller
particles likely occur in these samples; however, the detection
limit was restricted to 130 mm by the high throughput of
samples we analyzed.
We present diﬀerences between depths as a stratication
ratio (the ratio of particles found in the upper/lower prole) and
explore associations with clay content (Fig. 2). Six sites with low
clay had higher abundance in the 0–9 cm depth compared with
3 sites in the 9–18 cm depth. There are a number of factors
which can contribute to the migration and accumulation of MPs
throughout a soil prole.43 Roots and nematodes can inuence
the mobility of MP; for example, corn roots have contributed to
the upward migration of MPs in soil depth of 6–12 cm, while
earthworms inuenced the transport of MPs to deeper sedi-
ments.21,44 Wet and dry cycling can also contribute to the
transport of MPs into the deeper soil column, with more cycling
corresponding to deeper migration of MPs and smaller MPs
(<21 mm) showing the highest mobility.45 Topography, soil
texture, soil compaction, organic matter, and other soil metrics
may aﬀect the transport of MPs. Additionally, freeze-thaw
cycling
may
contribute
to
diﬀerences
in
MP
transport
throughout the soil prole at each site.45
In our experiments, the soil texture of the Tuttle burn site
was sandy or sandy loam, while the soil sampled at Crow Agency

and Lodge Grass contained higher content of clay and may have
held
more
water-stable
aggregates.
Particularly,
the
soil
sampled in Crow Agency contained 2.5 times more clay than the
Tuttle soil. Clay is oen positively associated with forming
aggregates and controlling pore architecture.46 In soils with clay
content such as Lodge Grass dump site, larger MPs could
potentially inltrate deeper into the soil due to less-compact
characteristics and/or greater pore connectivity. Conversely,
only smaller particles could inltrate the highly compact soil at
Tuttle burn site due to potentially decreased pore connectivity
and reduced water inltration. Clay particles are highly reactive
and may aﬀect the transport of MPs into lower depths.47 The 9–
18 cm prole of Crow Agency burn site contained more MPs in
three of the four quadrants; these clay-rich soils may promote
the accumulation of MPs at this depth due to clay-MP interac-
tions. There was little diﬀerence in soil texture across the
quadrants of Lodge Grass dump site and Tuttle burn site (single
family). Thus, the variation in stratication ratio should
consider other variables alongside texture including bulk
density, aggregation, and water inltration.
The few studies have examined the vertical distribution of
MPs through the terrestrial soil environment have found con-
trasting results.40,48,49 For example, MP abundance was slightly
higher at 20 cm depth (mean particle concentration = 53.2
items m−2) compared to 5 cm depth (mean particle concentra-
tion = 34.6 items m−2), and smaller average particle size was
observed in the deeper proles in agricultural soils from
China.48 A 3-times higher concentration in the 0–10 cm prole
compared to the 20–30 cm was quantied in German agricul-
tural elds.49 Microplastics concentrations did not signicantly
vary between 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm soil depths of biosolids-
applied elds in Spain.40 These results and our data indicate
that it is not possible to make generalizations about the
distribution of MPs through the soil prole.

Functional chemistry analysis of MP
A total of 58 of the 60 particles examined from Tuttle burn site,
105 of 110 particles examined from Crow Agency burn site, and
118 of 120 particles examined from Lodge Grass dump site were
conrmed as MPs by ATR-FTIR. Almost all MPs identied at
each site matched with burned or UV aged plastic spectra.
Examples of identied MPs from each site are shown in Fig. 3
and all examined particles are shown in Tables S10–S16 and
S21.† Oxidation features or changes in the spectra can be

observed in several particles compared to the reference spectra
(Fig. 3A–F). The spectra were analyzed according to the corre-
lation charts described in Larkin et al.50 The functional chem-
istry of LLDPE MPs indicated changes in the alkane C–H
stretching region (3000–2840 cm−1), sp3 C–H bend (∼1410–
1325 cm−1), C–O (1125–1000 cm−1), and alkene sp2 C–H (650–
1000 cm−1) compared to the reference spectrum (Fig. 3A).
Likewise, the functional chemistry of PE shied in the
alkane C–H stretching region (3000–2840 cm−1), sp3 C–H bend
(∼1410–1325 cm−1), C–O (1125–1000 cm−1), and alkene sp2
C–H (1000–650 cm−1) and PP MPs (Fig. 3A–C). On the other
hand, PS MPs show diﬀerent features in the aromatic C]C–
stretching region (1675–1475 cm−1) (Fig. 3D–F). Our results
indicate that in open burning sites, MPs are exposed to condi-
tions that modify their functional chemistry which likely aﬀects
the reactivity and mobility of those MPs in the environment.
Discrepancy in the functional chemistry of the reference
spectra,
environmentally
weathered
MPs,
and
thermally
oxidized MPs likely leads to the misidentication or under-
identication of microplastics by current spectral identica-
tion tools. The current challenges of spectral identication
highlight the need to generate more environmentally relevant
spectral
libraries
that
contain
thermally
aged
polymers.
However, more information is needed regarding the occurrence
of thermally oxidized MPs in the environment.
High temperatures and UV radiation may be both dened as
oxidation processes; however, UV radiation is driven by photo-
chemical reactions (e.g., oxidation, reduction decomposition,
and polymerization).51 Particularly in thicker plastics, these are
diﬀusion dependent and occur in the rst 500 to 900 mm layer of
the plastic.52 Thermal oxidation, on the other hand, can aﬀect
the surface and bulk within the same process as a function of
the temperature regardless of the thickness of the plastic.
Both high temperatures and UV radiation cause oxidation,
but through diﬀerent mechanisms.53 Although both processes
produce the similar functional groups, diﬀerences in the
mechanisms that produce these functional groups can lead to
mischaracterization if reference libraries lack a wide array of
spectra. In our study, to analyze the eﬀects of UV and thermal
oxidation, we compared the specic changes in the functional
groups of PE and PS under these conditions (Fig. 4). Our data
show that UV radiation induced less oxidation in the PE

functional chemistry (Fig. 5a). The lack of chromophore species
in PE results in non-UV absorbing structure. Functional groups
observed in the spectrum are likely linked to unidentied
chromophores from additives that absorb UV light and generate
radicals, leading to ketones (1712 cm−1) and vinyl-type unsa-
turation (909 cm−1, 987 cm−1, ∼1640 cm−1) which is consistent
with previous research.51,53,54 In contrast, thermal oxidation
caused the loss of characteristic peaks (2926, 2855, 1465, 1465,
and 720 cm−1) along with the formation of radicals (1369 cm−1
and 1407 cm−1) and carbonyl groups (1712 cm−1, 1180 cm−1,
and 1018 cm−1), respectively. These observations agreed with
previous ndings which found similar eﬀects on the functional
chemistry of PE.53,54 Previous studies have found that at
temperatures above 300 °C, C]C stretching may be caused by
dehydrogenation of an alkane, resulting from the material
degradation and increasing temperatures.54
Polystyrene, unlike PE, contains chromophores in its struc-
ture (specically the phenyl ring), which makes it easier to
identify the distinct eﬀects of UV compared to thermal oxida-
tion (Fig. 5B).51 Data indicate that UV exposure decreased the
characteristic
peaks
at
2919
cm−1
and
generated
C]O
stretching groups (1727 cm−1), while thermal oxidation gener-
ated C]O stretch at 1680 cm−1. However, we observed no other
clear diﬀerences between these oxidation processes. These
results suggest that chromophores in polymers induce a more
eﬃcient absorption of UV radiation at a wider wavelength which
results in a broader attack on the functional chemistry of the
polymer. Other studies that have explored PS degradation UV
conditions also suggest that the chromophore of PS (i.e., the
phenyl functional group) plays a role absorbing UV radiation.55
On the other hand, thermal oxidation decreased the signal of
the peaks at 1600, 1500 and 1468 cm−1.56 Our work evidenced
that open dumping and burning of solid wastes are a source of
MPs with a distinct functional chemical signature.
3.3
Thermally oxidized MPs in soils nearby open burning
sites
Our results indicated that burned MPs occurred with more
frequency in all the sites across the diﬀerent depths (Fig. 5). In
the 0–9 cm depth, the prevalence of burned MPs ranged from
71.2% to 89.8% (Fig. 5A), while the prevalence of burned MPs of
the 9–18 cm depth ranged from 82.1% to 93.8% across the three
sites (Fig. 5A). Lodge Grass, MT, was the site with the highest
abundance of burned MPs in the 0–9 cm range (89.8%), while
Tuttle, OK, was the site with highest relative abundance in the
9–18 cm range (93.8%). In all the sites, polyethylene-bearing
burned MPs (i.e., HDPE, LDPE, LLDPE) showed the highest
abundance in both soil depths across all sites (34.6–76.3%).
Finally, when considering the abundance of all plastics
regardless of their state of oxidation, polyethylene-bearing MPs
were the most abundant type in all depths and sites (average
69.78% ± 14.61), followed by PP (8.27% ± 7.88), CV(6.41% ±
4.29), and PS (5.62% ± 3.85).
The higher prevalence of PE compared to other polymers was
conrmed by py-GC/MS in all the sites sampled for total depths
reported (Crow Agency burn site at 5.97 ± 1.75 mg g−1, Lodge
Grass dump site at 4.99 ± 1.95 mg g−1, and Tuttle burn site at
6.13 ± 2.59 mg g−1) (Fig. 6). These data show very similar
concentrations of microplastics across sites including the
single-family site. However, the actual concentration of MPs
found in these samples with py-GC/MS may be underestimated
since the reference materials (standards) available for making
calibration curves and quantifying MPs exclude thermally and
UV oxidized MPs. Microplastics were found with less frequency
at background locations and lab controls than at the open
dump and burn sites.
No discernible pattern can be observed in the polymer type
as a function of depth. For instance, the abundance of PE was
dominant across ve data sets, but we did not detect PE in the
9–18 cm depth from the Tuttle, OK site. From the Crow Agency
site, we did not detect any other polymer in 9–18 cm depth,
while Lodge Grass showed a greater diversity of synthetic poly-
mer in the 9–18 cm depth.
Only two MPs were detected from the representative lab
control sample: one polyethylene and one polypropylene, likely
from laboratory procedures in which plastic could not be avoi-
ded. Compared to lab controls and background site particles
which were primarily white or clear bers, a variety of particle

morphologies (rectangular, oval-shaped, round, etc.) and colors
(blue, pink, grey, etc.) were observed in the open dump and burn
site particles (Fig. 5B). Overall, these ndings coincide with the
polymers most commonly used in household and single-use
plastic products that are oen discarded in municipal solid
waste.57

Conclusions
The results of this work identify open dumping and burning of
solid wastes as a source of elevated concentrations of terrestrial
MPs. Burning practices result in the generation of oxidized MPs
which diﬀer in abundance, size, and functional chemistry from
parent plastic waste solids. The concentration of particles found
at community-wide sites equals or exceeds the concentration of
potential MPs found at other sites with high concentrations of
MPs. We found no signicant diﬀerences in the concentration
of particles across soil depths. The high concentration of MPs
identied at the single-family open dumping and burning sites
highlights the potential of small sites to be as aﬀected as larger
sites. Generation of MPs through open dumping and burning of
solid waste is an issue concerning not only our partner
communities for this study in Oklahoma and Montana, but also
has profound global environmental implications for rural and
urban underserved communities. Open dumping and burning
of solid waste are utilized by approximately a quarter of all
humans on earth, and more work is needed to understand the
full scope and impact of this practice on the surrounding
environment.

"Rice Burning and Asthma Hospitalizations, Butte County, California,
1983-1992
Jeffrey Jacobs, Richard Kreutzer, and Daniel Smith
Environmental Health Investigations Branch, California Department of Health Services, Emeryville, CA 94608-2Q08 USA
We investigted the association between rice burning and daily asthma hospilizaions in Butet
County,aiia, m 1983 to 1992. Eighty;.two percent of planted rice was burned, with a
mean of 555 acres burned on days when burning was pe
d. For 60% ofthe day during this
period, no rice burning occurred. Peak buning ocrred in fall and sprn but was not

with criteria pollut amtsAa Va
s a

Poisson mode with daily
hospilizations as the outcome of interest, bum acr
showed
a
small
but stelevation of risk for hospitlization per acre of rice burned [rea-
tive risk (RRl) e 1.0001; 95% confidence intrvd (CI), 1.00004-1.0002], after adjusting for maxi-
mum daily temperature, seasonl factors, and yearly population. In this model, burn acreage
showed a do-response effect as acreage burned incr
. Days with the greatest areage burned
(>499 acre) had the Lagest risk of hosplizion (RR
11.23; CL, 1.09-1.39), and days with
modte burning (b
100 and 499 acre) had a sligh
lower risk of admision (ER

Previous research has raised concern over
the role that particulate air pollution plays
in the exacerbation of asthma. Recent stud-
ies have suggested that respirable particulate
pollution (PM1O) is significantly associated
with increased pulmonary morbidity and
mortality at levels well below current federal
standards (1,5. We were concerned with a
problem specific to California-the
postharvest burning of waste rice stubble,
with the subsequent production of res-
pirable particulates and its possible contri-
bution to asthma hospitalizations.
The practice of burning field stubble
and waste rice straw has been occurring
annually in the Sacramento Valley of
California since the 1920s, when farmers
began relying on fire to rid their fields of
waste straw that was difficult to plow under
in heavy, wet fields (3). Today, burning is
still seen as the most cost-effective method
of clearing waste stubble from fields in
preparation for the succeeding plantitg sea-
son, in addition to being the method of
choice for controlling stem-rot disease of
rice, which can severely decrease crop yield
(4). A major problem with rice straw burn-
ing is the emission of smoke and other pol-
lutants into the atmosphere and their effects
on ambient air quality and public health.
One study has shown that burning 1 ton of
dry rice straw emits about 7 pounds of par-
ticulate matter, 80 pounds of carbon
monoxide, and 10 pounds of hydrocarbons
(4). The California Air Resources Board
(CARB) estimated that from 1981 through
1994, Sacramento Valley Air Basin resi-
dents burned an average of 150,000 acres
of rice per year (5). With a 1-acre field
producing 3 tons of rice straw, the amount
of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere
from rice burning is significant. While
minimal health information regarding the
effects of rice straw burning has been com-
piled at present, many citizen complaints
and air pollution problems are reported to
occur during the fall rice straw burning
period, when pressure to burn acreage is at
its peak and meteorological conditions are
usually near their worst for smoke disper-
sion (4,5).
Prior to the 1970s, rice stubble burning
was unregulated; in 1971, in response to
public complaints, the state adopted rules
to minimize maximum daily burn totals.
In the 1980s the rice-growing industry
joined with state officials to set up an air
quality monitoring system to determine
where and when waste rice straw fires
could safely be set (6). In 1991 the state
legislature passed AB 1378, which mandat-
ed a 10% yearly reduction of rice stubble
burning, with the elimination of the prac-
tice entirely by the year 2000 (7I. Since
that time the annual percentage of acreage
permitted to be burned has decreased as
mandated; however, because yearly planted
acreage has increased, the amount of
acreage actually burned each year has only
minimally decreased. Presently, the state
legislature is being asked to consider a
request by rice growers who are asking for a
temporary freeze on the annual allowable
percentage of rice stubble burned, citing
economic hardship. This decision needs to
be made using more information regarding
the health effects related to the inhalation
of emissions from rice smoke.
We reviewed the possible effects of rice
burning on asthma hospitalizations in Butte
County, California, a rural county with the
largest population (182,000) by the 1990
Census (8) of any of California's rice-grow-
ing counties. Our objectives were to deter-
mine the effect of rice straw burning on daily
hospital admissions for asthma in Butte
County from 1983 to 1992. Additionally,
we ascertained whether rice straw burning
was related to air quality parameters [sus-
pended particulate matter <10 pm (PM14),
coefficient of haze (COH) and carbon
monoxide (CO)], which might act as proxies
for exposure to rice smoke.
Materials and Methods
Daily astuna hospitalization information was
compiled using 1983-1992 discharge data
tapes from the Califomia Office of Statewide
Health
Planning and Development
(OSHPD) (9). The data elements gathered
included age, race, and sex of each patient
and the day, month, and year admitted for
only those discharges from Butte County
hospitals with the principal diagnosis of asth-
ma (International Classification ofDiseases,
Revision 9; ICD-9, code 493) (1Q). There
were five hospitals in Butte County that oper-
ated throughout the 10-year time period; two
were located in Chico, with one each in
Oroville, Gridley, and Paradise. See Figure 1
for locations of hospitals and air monitoring
stations.

CARB. The highest value of the hourly
average values for each day was used in this
study as the daily ozone level (ppm) for
Butte County. Values were obtained from
one site, located in Chico, from 1 January
1983 to 31 December 1992, including 123
days with missing values. Days with miss-
ing environmental data were not more
prevalent during rice burning periods.
There did not appear to be a pattern to the
missing data, which most likely reflected
monitoring machine malfunction.
Carbon monoxide (CO) levels were
measured continuously by the nondispersive
infrared radiation method. Hourly average
values were recorded on a daily basis by
CARB. The highest value of the hourly
average values for each day was used in this
study as the daily CO level (ppm). CO val-
ues were obtained from two monitoring sta-
tions in Chico from 1 January 1983 to 31
December 1992 (including 170 and 327
missing values from stations 1 and 2, respec-
tively). These values were averaged to obtain
the mean daily CO level for Butte County.
Samples of suspended particulate mat-
ter <10 iim (PM1O) were collected approxi-
mately on every sixth day over a 24-hour
period on a quartz fiber filter by using a
high volume sampler equipped with a size-
selective inlet and operated at 36-44
ft3/min. This is a measurement of the mass
concentration of respirable particles that
can deposit in the alveoli. Daily mean val-
ues (in micrograms per cubic meter) were
recorded from three sites in Chico and
from one site in Biggs from 1 January 1983
to 31 December 1992. These values were
averaged to produce an every-sixth day
PM1O level for Butte County. Daily PM1O
values from the every-sixth day data were
calculated by performing a linear regression
using PM1O as the dependent variable and
modeling daily COH measurements, daily
03 values, precipitation amounts, and an
indicator variable for month from a
method suggested by Delfino (12). These
calculated values were recorded as the daily
PMIO level for Butte County.
Soiling index (COH) measurements
were made from particulate matter samples
that were collected by a smoke sampler. In
this procedure, sample air is drawn through
a 1-inch diameter spot of paper filter tape
at a rate of 6.25/1/min. A clean spot of the
filter paper tape is automatically advanced
for sampling every 2-3 hr. A photometer
detects the quantity of light absorbed by
the particulate matter on the tape and pro-
duces a proportional electrical signal. The
quantity of light absorbed, often referred to
as the soiling index, is reported in the
COH scale. Daily COH measurements
were recorded from monitoring stations in
Chico and Gridley from 1 January 1983
through 31 December 1992. These values
were averaged to create a daily COH level
for Butte County.
Weather information was compiled using
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) Climatological
Data California from 1983 to 1992 (13).
Variables recorded induded daily maximum
temperature, daily minimum temperature
(temperatures are in degrees Fahrenheit and
were averaged from hourly temperatures),
and daily precipitation totals in inches. All
weather variables were obtained from
NOAA's monitoring station in Chico from 1
January 1983 to 31 December 1992.
Rice acreage burned was compiled
using monthly crop burning acreage tally
sheets on file at the California Air
Resources Board and the Butte County Air
Pollution Control District in Durham,
California (14). Each air district receives
permit applications for agricultural burning
from growers in their region. The district
also keeps daily records of acreage burned
for individual crops and compiles a month-
ly tally sheet, which is filed at the district
level and sent to CARB. Daily burn acreage
amounts were obtained from 1 January
1982 through 31 December 1993. There
were five missing months of daily data
from 1983.
The daily counts of individuals needing
admission to hospitals for asthma in this
population was relatively rare (mean = 0.65
admissions/day) and follows a Poisson dis-
tribution. By contrast, ordinary least
squares regression analysis assumes that the
outcome is normally distributed. Therefore,
we elected to use Poisson regression in our
time-series analysis of rice burning and
environmental factors. Time-series analyses
have been the most sensitive methods for
assessing exposure effects when individual
exposure data is unavailable. We used the
general Poisson equation
log[E(Y.)] =Xp
(1)
where E(Y) denotes the expected number
of hospital admissions by day (i), Xi is the
matrix of covariates stratified by day, and 3
is the estimated regression coefficient.
The basic Poisson regression model ana-
lyzed the association between daily counts of
admission to all of the five Butte County
hospitals and either an individual air quality
parameter (03, CO, PM10, or COH) or rice
burn acreage. The basic model controlled
for temperature (modeled as a continuous
variable) because asthma exacerbations have
been shown to be affected by both heat and
cold (15). The basic model also controlled
for seasonal effects using indicator variables
to account for potential confounders (i.e.,
pollen), which may not be adequately con-
trolled by temperature, because numerous
countries including the United States have
described seasonal increases in both emer-
gency room visits and hospital admissions
(16,17). The county's population grew by
approximately 25% over the 10-year time
span in this study (18), so we used the esti-
mated annual population of Butte County in
the model to control for growth in popula-
tion during the decade of study. We did not
control for age, race, or sex in the regression
because the distribution of these variables in
the population do not vary from day to day
and do not influence the expected number of
asthma hospitalizations. In addition, the pro-
portions of these demographics in the popu-
lation remained constant during the period
of study. Days with missing environmental
data were not considered in the Poisson
regressions. Daily asthma hospitalization
counts and air pollution parameters were
analyzed for serial correlation through ordi-
nary least squares regression, and Durbin-
Watson statistics were derived. Residuals of
daily asthma admission counts were plotted
using autocorrelation-function plots. Both
techniques failed to demonstrate serial corre-
lation of admissions or pollution parameters
(19). The statistical package used for the
analysis was STATA 4.0 for Windows [Stata
Corporation, College Station, TX (20)].
Results
From 1 January 1983 to 31 December 1992
(3,653 days), 837,838 acres of rice were plant-
ed in Butte County, an annual average of
almost 84,000 acres. Over 690,000 acres
were burned (approximately 82% of planted
acreage), with an average annual burn of
69,030 acres. There were 2,253 days without
any rice burning (60%) during the 10-year
period. Of the remaining days, 151 values
were not recorded and 1,249 days had burn-
ing. When only burn days are considered,
the mean acreage burned was 555 acres,
with a median figure of 269 acres burned per
day (Table 1). The amounts ranged from a
low of 1 acre to a high of4,832 acres burned
per day.
Recorded ozone levels averaged 0.05
ppm/day over the 10-year period. The val-
ues ranged from a low of zero to a high of
0.13 ppm. Only 1% of daily ozone values
exceeded the California standard of 0.09
ppm. Daily carbon monoxide levels had a

mean of 2.48 ppm, with values ranging
from zero to over 13 ppm. Again, less than
1% of all recorded values during this time
were above the federal and state standard of
9.0 ppm. Coefficient of haze values averaged
2.36 COH units, with a median value of
1.8. Approximately 20% of recorded COH
values were >1, with approximately 45% of
values exceeding 2 units. Daily PM1O values
had a mean of 34.3 pg/m3, with a median
value of 29.1 pg/m3. Fifteen percent of the
daily values exceeded the California PM1O
standard of 50 pg/mi3.
During the 10-year period, there were
2,361 admissions to Butte County hospitals
with asthma as the primary diagnosis, with
a mean of 0.65 admissions/day. When
admissions were viewed by day, there were
1,978 days with no admissions (54.1%),
1,153 days with one admission (31.6%),
393 days with two admissions (10.8%), and
less than 4% with three or more admis-
sions. Over 50% of all asthma hospitaliza-
tions occurred in two hospitals in Chico,
the largest city in Butte County. Females
constituted 60% of all admissions for asth-
ma in Butte County during this time.
When frequencies were standardized by
person-years, older adults had the highest
rate with 265 admissions/100,000 popula-
tion, and children under 5 years of age had
the second highest rate with 235/100,000
population. The county's overall asthma
hospitalization
rate was 136 admis-
sions/100,000 population, well below the
1987 U.S. average of 188/100,000 (21).
The peak months for admission during
this period were January through March,
with approximately 30% of all admissions.
Admissions slowed in the warmer summer
months (less than 6% of total admis-
sions/month) and then began to rise in the
fall. Yearly admissions peaked in 1989 with
a population-adjusted rate of 177.3 admis-
sions/100,000 population.
Monthly rice burn acreage was observed
relative to air pollution parameters to deter-
mine whether pollution parameters could
be used as proxies for rice burning (Table
2). All air pollutants were poorly correlated
with rice burn acreage, with no Spearman
rank correlation (22) for any pair higher
than 0.06. Ozone levels were strongly corre-
lated with maximum daily temperature
(0.74), carbon dioxide levels were strongly
correlated with daily COH levels (0.72),
and COH values were strongly correlated
with daily PMI0 levels (0.81).
The outcome of interest, daily asthma
admissions to all hospitals in Butte County,
was analyzed in individual Poisson regressions
using a basic model with either daily rice
burn acreage or an individual air pollution
parameter as the exposure of interest (Table
3). All regressions controlled for maximum
daily temperature and season and were
adjusted for the yearly population of Butte
County. All air quality parameters showed
small but nonstatistically significant eleva-
tions of relative risk (RR) for daily asthma
hospitalizations. Elevations of PM1O showed
the largest risk of admission (RR
= 1.04) for
an increase of 1 pg/m3 of PM
concentra-
tion. Burn acreage showed a statistically sig-
nificant elevated risk of admission [RR =
1.0001; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.00004-1.0002] per acre on the day of hos-
pitalization. In this model, maximum daily
temperature showed a statistically significant
protective effect for asthma admissions [RR =
0.99; CI, 0.987-0.995). Winter had the
largest relative risk of admission for asthma
by season in this model (RR =1.15), but this
elevation was not statistically significant.
When burn acreage was categorized and
analyzed with indicator variables in this
model (Fig. 2), we observed a dose-response
effect as acreage burned increased. Days
with the greatest acreage burned (>499
acres) had the largest risk of hospitalization
(RR = 1.23; CI, 1.09-1.39), but days when
100-499 acres were burned also had a statis-
tically significant increased risk of admission
(RR= 1.2; CI, 1.05-1.37).

may be associated with increased asthma
hospitalizations, potential intermediates

totals of rice stubble burned and failed to
show a statistically significant elevation for
risk of admission with asthma. This may be
due to several reasons. First, because asth-
ma admissions to all Butte County hospi-
tals were quite small (<1/day), the power
was insufficient to detect a statistically sig-
nificant difference in admissions per
amount of pollutant measured per day,
despite having 10 years' worth of daily
data. Other factors that may have affected
admissions include problems with access to
health care, physician management prerog-
ative, and severity of the asthma attack.
Measurement error may also have played a
role in failing to find an elevated risk of
asthma hospitalization for population
exposures due to criteria pollutants.
Because there is inherent misclassifica-
tion in the use of fixed-site outdoor moni-
tors to represent overall population exposure
to air pollutants (12), a significant amount
of measurement error may have been intro-
duced into this study. Because the majority
of monitoring stations were located in
Chico, it is questionable whether the mea-
sured pollution values were truly representa-
tive of the population's exposure. In this
study it was assumed that each individual in
Butte County was exposed to the same
amount of pollution, which may be either
an overestimate or underestimate of the
actual exposure. Since only about 25% of
the county's residents live in Chico, three-
fourths of the population may potentially be
misclassified. Additionally, CARB burning
restrictions may be protective for larger
cities like Chico. These restrictions limit
and direct burning so that rice smoke and
particulates produced in the southern and
western part of the county are blown by
westerly winds and may not be measured by
monitors located in Chico (more northerly
located); therefore, residents in locations in
the county other than Chico may be
exposed to higher levels of particulates than
what is measured in Chico. Also, CARB has
regulated rice burning since the early 1980s
and prohibits the burning of rice straw on
days with poor air quality and dispersion
parameters. Days when burning is permitted
are relatively cleaner, with lower measured
pollutant values before the burning and
weather conditions have an increased capaci-
ty to mitigate effects from rice burning.
Finally, in Butte County, measurements for
PM10 were only recorded every sixth day.
We were able to calculate daily PMIO values
based on daily COH measurements, but
further error may have been introduced into
this study by the lack of actual measure-
ments of PM10 on over 80% of the days in
this study.
Despite these limitations, burn acreage
still showed a slight but statistically signifi-
cant increase in asthma hospitalization per
acre of rice burned when modeled with
daily maximum temperature, season, and a
term for yearly population. An increased
risk of admission per acre of rice burned
was still evident in succeedingly more com-
plex models, which also included terms for
criteria air pollutants. More suggestively,
rice burning demonstrated
a
clear
dose-response association with daily
admissions for asthma, with the highest
level of acreage burned contributing an
excess risk of 23%.
Based on the data from this study,
approximately 70,000 acres of rice stubble is
burned annually in Butte County. Prior
studies have shown that substantial amounts
of particulate pollution are generated from
rice burning, which is taken up by the
atmosphere and transported by the wind in
thick, acrid clouds of smoke (4). CARB
tracks smoke complaints from the public
during the intensive fall burning period.
From 1981 through 1984, the days with
smoke-related complaints averaged over
40% (5). While this study failed to demon-
strate a statistically significant relationship
between rice burn acreage and pollution
parameters, the high proportion of smoke-
related complaints suggests that some Butte
County residents are exposed to the smoke
and that air pollution monitoring may not
accurately reflect the actual exposures in
the population.
Limited studies have been published in
the medical literature analyzing the effect of
rice burning on pulmonary health, although
it has been suggested that rice straw smoke
produces an irritant effect to the upper air-
ways (4). While no prior population-based
studies have been performed to examine
this question, McCurdy et al. (23) recently
published their findings of 464 rice farmers
in the northern Sacramento Valley, which
demonstrated some elevations in respiratory
morbidity. They found that the prevalence
for physician-diagnosed asthma (7.1% in
their cross-sectional study) was moderately
above that seen in population-based studies,
such as the National Health Interview
Study. While rice farmers are exposed to
other occupational agents (dusts and pesti-
cides) that may potentially effect respiratory
health, this increased prevalence may also
be due in part to exposure to rice burning.
McCurdy et al. (23) also reported that
chronic cough (coughing on most days of
the week for 3 consecutive months or more
during the year) was associated in a
dose-response fashion with reported hours
per year of burning rice stubble. While
farmers would be expected to have higher
exposures than individuals living farther
from the fields, exposures to these more dis-
tant individuals likely occurs, as evidenced
by increases in complaints to GARB, during
the fall burning season (5). The study of
McCurdy et al. (23) lends biological cre-
dence to the inference that exposure to rice
smoke may produce or exacerbate asthma.
The data from Butte County suggests
that rice burning (especially on days of high
volume burning) may produce a small, but
potentially preventable, effect on asthma
admissions. The population-attributable risk
(PAR; the fraction of the total asthma admis-
sions that would have been prevented if rice
burning had not occurred) can be calculated
from a formula by Bruzzi et al. (24) and was

found to be 2.6% (PAR = 1- 1/x II; l/r,
where x = the total number of asthma cases
and r = each of the relative risks for admis-
sion by burn acreage strata) (24). Dividing
the total number of asthma hospitalizations
in Butte County by the period of the study
(2361/10) and multiplying by the PAR
(2.6%), we see that approximately six asthma
cases/year could be attributable to rice burn-
ing. While this number is relatively small, it
is important to realize that the majority of
individuals who may be affected by rice
burning may never become sufficiently ill to
require hospitalization. These individuals
may include those who regard rice smoke as
a nuisance and complain to the air board or
are silent about this problem. Those with
respiratory or cardiac disease may increase
the frequency of their medications during
burning episodes, visit their regular physi-
cians, or present at the emergency depart-
ment without being observed in the
OSHPD hospital discharge data base.
Our data suggests that while CARB
regulations have been effective in mitigat-
ing the problem of air pollution caused by
rice burning on the basis of monitoring
data analysis, it is less clear that these regu-
lations are as effective in preventing hospi-
talizations for asthma when hospitalizations
are analyzed by actual acreage burned.
Conclusion
Increases in rice straw burn acreage were
shown to contribute to hospital admissions
for asthma in Butte County, California,
during a decade of observation. Rice burn
acreage was not correlated to air pollution
parameters monitored by CARB in limited
parts of the county. These pollution para-
meters were not associated with increases in
asthma hospitalizations. The time-series
method, although insensitive compared to
traditional case-control methods, demon-
strated an apparent association between
acres burned and daily asthma admissions.
Additionally, a dose-response effect was
seen, with the risk of asthma hospitalization
increasing as the number of acres burned
increased. Future studies should attempt to
better clarify exposure perhaps using expo-
sure models broken down by zip code
areas. In addition, future studies may con-
sider using visits to emergency rooms or
local physicians' offices as a better indicator
of respiratory exacerbations. While the use
of hospitalization data was considerably
easier in terms of time spent extracting
records and cheaper in terms of cost, it may
have underestimated the number of those
affected with asthma because there are
many fewer hospitalizations for asthma
than visits to emergency rooms.

Burning of agricultural fields is an understudied source of air pollution in rural communities in the United States. 
Smoke from agricultural burning contains air toxics that adversely impact respiratory health. Imperial County in 
southeastern California is a highly productive agricultural valley that heavily employs agricultural burning to 
clear post-harvest crop remnants. We related individual-level exposure to agricultural burns to parent-reported 
respiratory symptoms in children. 
We leveraged the Children's Assessing Imperial Valley Respiratory Health and the Environment (AIRE) cohort 
of 735 predominantly Hispanic low-income elementary school students in Imperial County. Parents reported 
children's respiratory health symptoms and family demographic characteristics in questionnaires collected at 
enrollment and in annual follow-up assessments from 2017 to 2019. Permitted agricultural burns in Imperial 
County from 2016 to 2019 were spatially linked to children's geocoded residential addresses. We used gener­
alized estimating equations to evaluate prevalence differences (PDs) in respiratory symptoms with increasing 
exposure to agricultural burning within 3 km in the 12 months prior to each assessment.

Nearly half of children (346, 49 %) lived within 3 km of at least one agricultural burn in the year prior to study 
enrollment. In adjusted models, each additional day of agricultural burning in the prior year was associated with 
a one percentage point higher prevalence of wheezing (PD 1.1 %; 95 % CI 0.2 %, 2.0 %) and higher bronchitic 
symptoms (PD 1.0 %; 95 % CI -0.2 %, 2.1 %). Children exposed to four or more days of burning had an absolute 
increased prevalence of wheezing and bronchitic symptoms of 5.9 % (95 % CI -0.3 %, 12 %) and 5.6 % (95 % CI 
-1.8 %, 13 %), respectively, compared to no burn exposure. Associations with wheezing were stronger among 
children with asthma (PD 14 %; 95 % CI -1.4 %, 29 %). 
To our knowledge, this is the first U.S. study of agricultural burning and children's respiratory health. This 
work suggests that reducing agricultural burning could improve children's respiratory health.   
1. Introduction 
Open burning of agricultural fields to remove crop residue left after 
harvesting remains a common agricultural practice and an underap­
preciated source of air pollution exposure worldwide (Jenkins et al., 
1992). Globally, agricultural burning is widespread and accounts for 
nearly half as much biomass burned as wildfires (Rangel and Vogl, 
2018). Across the continental United States (US), agricultural burning 
amounts to an estimated ~3 to 5.8 million acres burned annually 
(McCarty et al., 2009; Pouliot et al., 2017). Approximately 15.5 million 
people within the US are affected by crop burning and related smoke 
exposures (McCarty, 2011). While prior research has identified adverse 
health impacts from wildfire events (Holstius et al., 2012) and domestic 
biomass burning (Naeher et al., 2007), there is a paucity of research on 
the specific impact of agricultural burning on health in US populations, 
despite evidence that it is a widespread practice associated with release 
of toxic air pollutants (Rangel and Vogl, 2018). 
California (CA) burns the largest acreage of crop residue of any state, 
approximately 205,000 acres per year, producing an estimated six tons 
per day of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 2017 (Pouliot et al., 2017; 
California Air Resources Board (CARB), 2021a). These burns are 
concentrated in three agricultural regions: San Joaquin Valley in Central 
CA, Butte County near Sacramento, and Imperial Valley in southeastern 
CA (California Air Resources Board (CARB), 2021a). The majority of the 
estimated 17 % of the population of CA that lives near agricultural 
burning (McCarty, 2011) are people of color and living below the 
poverty line (Assessment OoEHH, 2015), making this exposure an 
environmental justice concern. 
Residents of the rural border region of the Imperial Valley are >80 % 
Latino with a 20 % unemployment rate, and >1 in 3 children live in 
poverty (Bureau USC, 2014). These communities contend with poor air 
quality and elevated particulate matter (PM) levels, with concentrations 
reaching 10 times the federal limits (Johnston et al., 2019). In 2022, the 
American Lung Association ranked El Centro, the largest city in the re­
gion, among the 10 most polluted metropolitan areas in the country for 
year round particle pollution (American Lung Association, 2022). 
Further, residents of this region experience elevated rates of asthma 
morbidity. One in 5 children is diagnosed with asthma and the rate of 
asthma-related pediatric emergency room visits and hospitalizations is 
double the CA state average (Lipsett et al., 2009; Farzan et al., 2019). 
Compared to other sources of air pollution, agricultural burning is an 
underrecognized source of air toxic exposures in CA. Although smoke 
from agricultural burning generally has been considered as more of a 
nuisance than a public health hazard, due to the relatively short, 
episodic exposure periods (Wu et al., 2006), smoke from agricultural 
burning contains chemical compounds – including PM, nitrogen dioxide, 
and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Holder et al., 2017) – which can have 
detrimental impacts on human health as a result of both acute and 
chronic exposures (Jimenez et al., 2006). Researchers have measured 
significantly higher coarse (PM10) and fine (PM2.5) PM levels within 2 
miles of agricultural burns in Imperial Valley (Wagner et al., 2012). 
Moreover, components of PM that are produced by the burning of 
biomass (e.g. potassium, organic carbon, and elemental carbon) (Yoon 
et al., 2018; Sarnat et al., 2008) are more strongly associated with 
emergency department visits for respiratory disease, as compared to 
other sources of PM2.5 (Sarnat et al., 2008; Krall et al., 2017a). While the 
literature assessing health endpoints is limited, existing evidence sug­
gests that open burning of agricultural fields has adverse health conse­
quences for nearby populations (Long et al., 1998; Van Horne et al., 
2022). 
To our knowledge, there is no study in the U.S. that has examined the 
association between children's health and agricultural burning, nor is 
much known about the implications of agricultural burning for chil­
dren's respiratory health in general. The purpose of this study was to 
assess the respiratory health impacts of agricultural burning in a rural, 
diverse population of school aged children in Imperial Valley, CA. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study population 
Community concerns about air pollutants and children's respiratory 
health led to the initiation of the Children's Assessing Imperial Valley 
Respiratory Health and the Environment (AIRE) Study, a community- 
academic partnership with the Comit´e Civico del Valle (CCV), an Im­
perial Valley-based community organization. This partnership facili­
tated connections with school administrators (superintendents and 
principals) throughout the Imperial Valley who agreed to support study 
activities. To reflect the variability of the communities and environ­
mental exposures, we ultimately selected one elementary school from 
five of the eight towns in the region for participation. Children were 
enrolled in 2017–2019 while in 1st and 2nd grade. All children were 
eligible to participate. Teachers distributed consent forms and ques­
tionnaires in both English and Spanish for children to bring home to 
their parents. Parents of 735 children consented to their child's partici­
pation in the AIRE Study, and 708 (96 %) completed and returned the 
accompanying baseline questionnaire. 
2.2. Outcome assessment 
AIRE adapted survey instruments from the validated International 
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire and 
the Children's Health Study developed to assess the prevalence of res­
piratory symptoms (Mallol et al., 2013a; Peters et al., 1999). Parents and 
guardians were asked to complete this questionnaire upon enrollment 
and as part of the annual follow-up assessments conducted in 
2017–2019. The survey included a series of questions about their child's 
health history and during the prior 12 months, including asthma, res­
piratory symptoms (i.e. persistent cough, wheezing, shortness of 
breath), respiratory infections, medication use, outdoor/physical ac­
tivity, allergies/atopic conditions, and eye disease/irritation (Mallol 
et al., 2013b). 
The primary outcomes of interest for this study were the 12-month 
period prevalences of wheezing, sneezing, and bronchitic symptoms. 
Bronchitic symptoms were defined as having any one of the following 
symptoms in the prior 12 months: a) a cough first thing in the morning 
or b) cough at other times of day that lasted for as much as 3 months in a 
row during the previous 12 months; c) congestion or phlegm not

accompanied by a cold; or d) a report of bronchitis during the previous 
12 months (McConnell et al., 2006; McConnell et al., 2003). 
2.3. Exposure to agricultural burning 
In California, agricultural burns are regulated by the California Air 
Resources Board (CARB), which requires reporting to the local air 
quality management district as of 2003 (Title 17 §80,100). In Imperial 
Valley, the Air Pollution Control District (APCD) maintains records of 
permitted burns that include burn date, acres burned, crop type, and the 
nearest Imperial Irrigation District (IID) canal gate to the burn as a 
spatial reference. Burn activity, by regulations, occurs during school 
hours (typically lasting from morning though mid-afternoon). We ac­
quired all of the permitted burns in Imperial Valley in 2016–2019 and 
geocoded them using the location of the nearest IID canal gate as re­
ported in each permit. We spatially linked these points to the locations of 
children's residential addresses at the time each study questionnaire was 
completed using ArcMap (ESRI). One child's home address could not be 
geocoded; they were assigned the location of their school. 
We calculated the number of days of burning that had occurred 
within 3 km of a child's residence in the 12 months prior to each ques­
tionnaire. We assessed exposure both continuously and categorically. 
We divided the exposed population into three equal groups to create a 
total of four categories: “no exposure,” “low (1 day),” “medium (2-3 
days),” and “high (4 or more days)” exposure levels. 
2.4. Covariates 
Parents reported children's health history and child and family de­
mographic characteristics in questionnaires collected at enrollment and 
in annual follow-up assessments from 2017 to 2019. These included 
children's characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, history of 
asthma diagnosis and medication use, as well as parent/caregiver in­
formation including educational attainment, insurance coverage, 
maternal history of asthma, and tobacco usage. Child exposure to 
secondhand smoke at home was defined as living with a current smoker 
or the presence of any regular visitors who smoke inside the home, 
regardless of whether the child is also present. Maternal smoking during 
pregnancy was dichotomized as any or none. 
The California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA) Department of 
Water Resources (DWR) collects, compiles, and publishes publicly 
available maps of land use data in California, including a statewide 
“crop map.” We spatially linked children's residential addresses to the 
fields/land identified as agriculture using this map and estimated home 
proximity to the nearest agricultural field for each child. Since proximity 
to agricultural fields may indicate additional exposure to pesticides or 
diesel equipment, and current California regulations prohibit agricul­
tural pesticide applications within ¼ mile (~402 m) of schools (C.C.R. 
6690, 2018), we dichotomized distance to agricultural fields at 400 m. 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
We estimated differences in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms 
over 12 months associated with exposure to agricultural burning within 
3 km using generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable 
covariance matrix and the robust sandwich estimator of the variance to 
account for repeated observations from some participants. We specified 
the identity link and Gaussian distribution to obtain estimates of prev­
alence differences (rather than odds ratios) (Naimi and Whitcomb, 
2020). 
Based on prior literature, directed acyclic graphs, and model fit 
(using quasilikelihood under the independence model criterion [QIC], a

modification of the Akaike's information criterion [AIC]), we adjusted 
models for child sex, highest education among child's caretakers at 
baseline (dichotomized at < high school), distance to agriculture at 
survey (dichotomized at 400 m), language of survey, and biological 
mother's history of asthma. We chose a priori to additionally evaluate 
models stratified by doctor-diagnosed asthma. 
In sensitivity analyses, we additionally adjusted for maternal smok­
ing during pregnancy and children's exposure to secondhand smoke, and 
we stratified models by the reported use of asthma control medications. 
We also evaluated alternative measures of exposure to agricultural 
burning (number of burns, acres burned), as well as agricultural burning 
occurring within 5 km of children's addresses. 
3. Results 
There were 906 permitted agricultural burns in Imperial Valley in 
2016–2019 (Fig. 1). The most frequently listed crop burned was 
Bermuda (n = 467, 52 %), followed by wheat (n = 191, 21 %), sudan (n 
= 79, 9 %), and klein (n = 66, 7 %), all of which are types of grasses 
typically used as animal feed. Burning varied by season and crop, with 
43 % burns occurring in January or February and another third in June 
through August (Supplemental Figs. S1, S2). 
Between 2017 and 2019, 708 children in the AIRE Study contributed 
932 observations, 880 of which were not missing outcomes or key co­
variate information (child sex, family education, or asthma diagnosis). 
Children lived between 0.27 and 14 km from an agricultural burn in the 
12 months prior to the date of their parent's questionnaire, with a me­
dian of 3 km. Nearly three quarters of children lived within 5 km of at 
least one agricultural burn (Supplemental Table S1). Measures of 
exposure to agricultural burning were highly correlated (Supplemental 
Table S2). 
Children who lived within 3 km of a permitted agricultural burn in 
the 12 months prior to enrollment were generally similar to those who 
lived further from agricultural burning (Table 1), except for their 
proximity to agricultural land. Counterintuitively, the children living 
closest to agricultural land were less likely to also be exposed to agri­
cultural burning than those living >400 m from agriculture. At enroll­
ment, 130 (20 %), 231 (35 %), and 158 (23 %) children reported 
wheezing, sneezing or bronchitic symptoms, respectively in the prior 12 
months. 
In unadjusted models, each additional day of agricultural burning in 
the prior 12 months was associated with a 1 percentage point increase in 
prevalence of wheezing (95 % CI 0.10 %, 1.88 %), and 0.83 percentage 
point increase in prevalence of bronchitic symptoms (95 % CI -0.25 %, 
1.91 %) (Table 2). Adjustment for covariates did not materially change 
estimates. In adjusted models restricted to children with doctor- 
diagnosed asthma, each additional day of agricultural burning in the 
prior 12 months was associated with a 2.34 percentage point increase in

the prevalence of wheezing (95 % CI 0.73 %, 3.96 %) and a 1.96 per­
centage point increase in the prevalence of sneezing (95 % CI 0.08 %, 
3.84 %). 
When exposure to days of agricultural burning was categorized into 
quartiles, children with the highest level of exposure (4–13 days in the 
prior 12 months) within 3 km of their residence had a prevalence of 
wheezing that was 6.49 (95 % CI: −0.27 %, 13.25 %) percentage points 
higher than the prevalence of wheezing in children with no exposure 
after adjusting for child sex, caretaker education, distance to agricul­
tural land, and maternal history of asthma (Fig. 2, Supplemental Table 
S3). 
Associations between agricultural burning and respiratory symptoms 
appear to be driven by children with asthma; those with the highest 
exposure had a prevalence of wheezing and sneezing that were 15.08 
(95 % CI 0.29 %, 29.87 %) and 16.94 (95 % CI -0.10 %, 33.99 %) per­
centage points higher than that among children with asthma unexposed 
to agricultural burning within 3 km of their residence (Fig. 2, Supple­
mental Table S3).

burns (rather than days of burning) in the prior 12 months to define 
exposure to agricultural burning, estimates of association were similar 
(Supplemental Tables S4-S7). When we evaluated exposure to agricul­
tural burning within 5 km of a child's residence, we found similar as­
sociations; however, the number and days of burning within 5 km was 
also positively associated with the prevalence of bronchitic symptoms 
among children without asthma (Supplemental Tables S6, S8). Models 
stratified by the reported use of asthma control medication were similar 
to those stratified by doctor-diagnosed asthma (Supplemental Tables S7, 
S9). There was limited evidence of positive associations between the 
acres of land burned within 5 km and prevalence of children's respira­
tory outcomes. Additional adjustment for maternal smoking during 
pregnancy and children's secondhand smoke exposure did not materially 
alter results (data not shown). 
4. Discussion 
In this novel study of children's respiratory health, we found that 
children living near agricultural burning in Imperial Valley, California 
had a higher prevalence of wheezing, sneezing, and bronchitic symp­
toms than children living further from permitted burns. To our knowl­
edge, this is the first U.S. study to document associations between 
children's respiratory health symptoms and agricultural burning, and 
our results both provide a strong basis for future investigation into links 
between episodic outdoor smoke exposure and children's health out­
comes in rural communities and also identify areas for future research. 
Notably, we identified a clear, statistically significant signal in this 
community that is already disproportionately burdened by both air 
pollution and asthma hospitalizations. 
Children are highly susceptible to the impacts of air pollutants, as 
their lungs and immune systems are still developing. Exposure to air

pollutants has been linked to acute adverse respiratory effects, such as 
asthma exacerbations and respiratory distress, while early life insults to 
the lung may elevate the risk of long-term disease (Stocks et al., 2013; 
Micklin, 1998). Children may be at greatest risk of long-term effects of 
air pollutant exposures, such as deficits in lung growth, airway inflam­
mation and new onset asthma (Stocks and Sonnappa, 2013). Over 6 
million children in the US are living with asthma (Akinbami et al., 
2016), making it the most commonly diagnosed chronic childhood 
disorder. As the prevalence of pediatric asthma continues to rise, trends 
suggest widening racial, ethnic and economic disparities (Akinbami 
et al., 2016; Bhan et al., 2015). 
It is estimated that 15.5 million people within the contiguous US are 
affected by crop burning (McCarty, 2011). However, there is a paucity of 
data on agricultural burnings in the scientific literature and limited or 
inconsistent reporting of burn activities on the national scale (Lin et al., 
2012). One study suggested that over 12,000 km2 were burned annually 
in the contiguous United States (US), which is equivalent to ~43 % of 
the annual average area of wildland fires (McCarty et al., 2009). It is 
anticipated that the contribution of agricultural burning as a source of 
global air toxics, PM emissions, and greenhouse gases will continue to 
rise as more agricultural land uses burning to clear crop residue (Kor­
ontzi et al., 2006). 
Smoke from agricultural burning contains various chemical com­
pounds, including PM, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, black and 
brown carbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Holder et al., 
2017). Across the continental US, it is estimated that ~50,000 tons of 
PM2.5 are attributable to crop burning each year (Pouliot et al., 2017). 
Among counties with burning in eastern Washington, crop burning was 
found to be the second largest source of PM2.5 (~35 %), after airborne 
soil (Jimenez et al., 2006). Real-time short-term field measurements in 
2012 in Imperial Valley, CA found that PM10, PM2.5 and naphthalene (a 
PAH) were significantly elevated downwind of crop burning when 
compared to upwind samples (Harnly et al., 2012). In general, however, 
studies have relied on a few field measures or on estimates derived from 
satellite data because the limited monitoring network in most rural areas 
results in inadequate data to fully characterize changes in air quality due 
to burning episodes under varying meteorological conditions (Jimenez 
et al., 2006). Additionally, agricultural burning pollutants are likely as 
toxic as other sources of air pollutants; in one toxicological study, a 
single low dose of ambient particles of agricultural burning-derived 
particles induced significant alterations in pulmonary mechanics and 
lung histology in mice, similar to the effects of traffic-derived particles 
(Mazzoli-Rocha et al., 2008). Therefore, air pollutants generated by 
agricultural burning may be as detrimental to respiratory health as other 
well characterized sources. 
The health effects of agricultural field burning smoke exposure have 
been less extensively studied when compared to other anthropogenic air 
pollutants such as fossil fuel combustion, likely due to the combination 
of relatively brief and intermittent burning activities and the setting of 
rural communities with lower population density and sparser air quality 
monitoring infrastructure (Wu et al., 2006). While previous studies have 
supported an association between agricultural burning and respiratory 
health, most have focused on emergency department (ED)/hospitaliza­
tion data among adults and lack detailed individual-level assessment of 
respiratory health symptoms. In a multicity US-based study that exam­
ined primary source-specific PM2.5, researchers found evidence that 
PM2.5 from biomass burning was positively associated with respiratory 
disease ED visits (Krall et al., 2017b). Positive and statistically signifi­
cant associations have been observed between increases in PM2.5, 
elemental carbon, and organic carbon, a marker of vegetative burning, 
and respiratory-related hospital admissions (Peng et al., 2009). Re­
searchers have measured a decrease in lung function during the burning 
season, as compared to non-burning seasons, in adults (Agarwal et al., 
2010) and in children (Awasthi et al., 2010). In Hawaii, the ratio of ED 
visits for respiratory illness in exposed versus unexposed populations 
was higher on burn days compared to non-burn days, although this 
difference was not statistically significant after controlling for temporal 
confounders and wind direction (Mnatzaganian et al., 2015). A similar 
study in Louisiana also found a positive, but not significant, association 
between asthmatic hospitalization rates during sugar cane burning pe­
riods (Boopathy et al., 2002). An ecological time-series study in Brazil 
found that hospital admissions for asthma were significantly higher 
during burn periods compared to non-burn periods (Arbex et al., 2007). 
Epidemiological studies on health effects of non-fossil fuel PM ex­
posures in vulnerable communities is limited (De Sario et al., 2013). 
Previous research suggests that people of lower socioeconomic status 
and racial/ethnic minorities are more vulnerable to the adverse health 
effects of pollution. For example, epidemiological studies have found 
higher mortality effects of air pollution among the less educated (Vega 
et al., 1999) and among racial/ethnic minorities (Ito and Thurston, 
1995). Furthermore, in the US, the distributions and types of rural 
pollution are typically not well characterized, nor are the population- 
level health effects of such types of pollution (Michael et al., 2010). 
Rural low-income and people of color often lack the financial and social 
resources to mitigate their exposures, such as moving to less polluted 
areas, using air conditioners instead of opening windows, or influencing 
local and state government to reduce pollution exposures (M. TK., 
2001). 
This study evaluated associations between residential proximity to 
agricultural burning and children's respiratory health using individual 
exposure assessment and detailed respiratory symptom ascertainment. 
Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, we cannot determine 
whether agricultural burning is causing the observed associations with 
respiratory health symptoms. There may be residual confounding due to 
unmeasured risk factors for children's respiratory health that varied with 
the distribution of exposure to agricultural burning over the course of 
12 months. The outcomes of this study were the 12-month period 
prevalences of parent-reported symptoms of respiratory health using a 
modified ISAAC questionnaire (Mallol et al., 2013a). This assessment is 
well-validated and has been used extensively to evaluate associations 
between air pollution and children's respiratory health (McConnell 
et al., 2003; McConnell et al., 1999; Andersson et al., 2011) However, 
this measure may be subject to recall bias if parents of children with 
more extreme or more recent symptoms were more likely to report them. 
Parent questionnaires did not reference any air pollution/emission 
events, but it is possible that respiratory symptoms that occurred during 
days of agricultural burning may have been more memorable. The di­
rection of any potential bias is uncertain, however, because agricultural 
burning may have occurred in either close or distant temporal proximity 
to the time of the questionnaires. There are several important environ­
mental factors linked to children's respiratory health that we were un­
able to account for in this study. We did not adjust for ambient ozone, as 
there was only one active EPA ozone monitor in Imperial Valley during 
the study period, nor did we adjust for temperature or relative humidity, 
as these factors are similar across the Valley, with limited variation 
expected between individuals over a 12 month period for any of these 
measures. Further, we were unable to account for any potential differ­
ences in indoor air quality between participants over the course of the 
study. We chose not to adjust for ambient particulate matter, as agri­
cultural burning is a key source of PM levels in Imperial Valley (Harnly 
et al., 2012; Kelly et al., 2010; Watson and Chow, 2001). Future research 
is warranted to investigate the co-occurrence of other environmental 
exposures in the region known to be related to respiratory symptoms, 
such as traffic-related pollution or industrial emissions, and to evaluate 
symptoms over shorter time periods or to examine associations with 
clinical measures of respiratory health. 
We relied on permits from the Air Pollution Control District to assign 
exposure to agricultural burning. There may be some misclassification 
due to discrepancies between information reported on permits and the 
actual burns that occurred. Moreover, we did not account for the wind 
speed and direction during the burns, which could affect which residents 
are potentially affected by the burns. Further investigation comparing

agricultural permits to satellite imagery or smoke plumes, local air 
monitoring data, or other quantitative metrics of potential exposure 
from agricultural burns could clarify the extent to which the permits 
reflect true smoke exposure among the surrounding communities. 
However, because agricultural burning is regulated via the permitting 
process, permits are a highly policy-relevant marker of this exposure. 
Understanding the relationship between metrics that can be identified – 
and potentially regulated – by the permitting process, such as the 
number or size of permitted burns, is useful to developing policy solu­
tions to protect children's health. Further, although correlated with 
number of burns and burn days, we do not see statistically significant 
associations between acres of crops burned and children's respiratory 
health. Rather, our findings provide an important foundation for future 
prospective analyses of agricultural burning and children's respiratory 
health. 
Participation in our study was open to all children enrolled in in 2nd- 
3rd grades in 2017–2018 at five schools from different towns across 
Imperial Valley. Because we did not enroll children from every 
elementary school in the area, the generalizability of our results may be 
limited. However, this population of low income, predominantly His­
panic/Latino families is reflective of both the demographic character­
istics of much of the Imperial Valley as well as that of communities 
disproportionately exposed to prescribed burning to prevent wildfires 
(Kondo et al., 2022), another potential source of periodic smoke expo­
sure in much of the Western United States, Australia, and elsewhere 
where wildfire management tools are required. Like agricultural 
burning, prescribed burns can emit localized high levels of PM and other 
respiratory irritants from the combustion of biomass (Jaffe et al., 2020; 
Haikerwal et al., 2015). Although to our knowledge there is no existing 
research of the impacts of prescribed burns specifically on children's 
respiratory health, our results support literature linking even modest 
levels of wildfire smoke exposure to pediatric asthma exacerbations and 
respiratory emergency admissions (Aguilera et al., 2021; Moore et al., 
2023). 
Agricultural burning persists as a widespread practice in California, 
the United States, and globally. It is a fast, inexpensive method that 
requires minimal resources to remove excess biomass and transition 
between crops when fields are replanted multiple times in a growing 
season (California Air Resources Board (CARB), n.d.). It can also be an 
effective method to control crop pests and diseases. Alternatives, such as 
soil tillage, chipping and mulching, and whole orchard recycling, can 
improve both soil health and broader environmental health outcomes 
(Ni et al., 2016; California Air Resources Board (CARB), 2021b; Wal­
lander, 2020), but can be costly and out of reach for small farmers 
(Klein, 2022). Elsewhere in California, regulators aim to phase out the 
practice of agricultural burning by 2025 – in part by providing financial 
incentives for choosing more sustainable alternatives – with the goals of 
improving air quality and public health outcomes (California Air Re­
sources Board (CARB), 2021a; California Air Resources Board (CARB), 
2021b). To our knowledge, no such financial incentive programs yet 
exist in Imperial Valley. 
5. Conclusion 
Agricultural burning is an important and underappreciated source of 
air pollution in rural California. Our results indicate a link between this 
exposure and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among vulnerable 
school-aged children in Imperial Valley. Reducing agricultural burning 
would require substantial investment from state and local regulators and 
policymakers. Further research should explore whether and how such 
investments in Imperial Valley would improve the respiratory health of 
vulnerable children in these communities.

Waste collection services are uncommon in rural areas of low-resource countries, causing waste accumulation 
and subsequent dumping and burning of garbage. Air pollution from household garbage burning, including 
plastics, has been observed in Jalapa, Guatemala in addition to household air pollution (HAP) from cooking. 
Adolescent girls often help with these cooking and household tasks, but little is known about their exposures. We 
characterized 24-h exposures to HAP and household garbage burning in adolescent girls by measuring fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), urinary biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates. We recruited 60 girls between 13 and 17 years of age who helped with 
cooking activities and lived with participants of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. 
We recruited n = 30 girls each from the control (wood-burning stove) and intervention (liquefied petroleum gas 
stove) arms. We also measured real-time kitchen concentrations of BC in 20 homes (33%). PM2.5 and BC were

measured in n = 21 control and n = 20 intervention participants. Median concentrations of personal PM2.5 and 
BC and kitchen BC were lower (p < 0.05) in the intervention arm by 87%, 80%, and 85%, respectively. PAH 
metabolite concentrations were lower (p < 0.001) for all nine metabolites in intervention (n = 26) compared to 
control participants (n = 29). Urinary BPA concentrations were 66% higher in participants who reported using 
cosmetics (p = 0.02), and phthalate concentrations were 63% higher in participants who had reported using hair 
products during the sample period (p = 0.05). Our results suggest that gas stoves can reduce HAP exposures 
among adolescents who are not primary cooks at home. Biomarkers of plastic exposure were not associated with 
intervention status, but some were elevated compared to age- and sex-matched participants of the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).   
1. Introduction 
Household air pollution (HAP) is generated from the use of solid or 
“biomass” fuels (coal, charcoal, wood, animal dung, and agricultural 
crop residues) in open fires or inefficient cookstoves in or near the home 
(Johnson et al., 2021; Zhang and Smith, 2007). The majority of the 
approximately 3.8 billion people impacted by HAP live in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) (Health Effects Institute, 2020). The 
smoke that results from the incomplete combustion of biomass fuels is a 
heterogeneous mixture of harmful air pollutants including fine partic­
ulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and polycyclic aromatic hy­
drocarbons (PAHs)(Arif et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). 
Another form of HAP exposure besides cooking activities is house­
hold garbage burning. This is of particular concern in rural areas of 
LMICs, where there is a general lack of infrastructure for waste collec­
tion facilities (Edjabou et al., 2012; Hiramatsu et al., 2009; Lemieux 
et al., 2004; Ramadan et al., 2022; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 
2016). Waste collection rates in rural LMICs are estimated at 33% (Kaza 
et al., 2018), leaving approximately two billion people worldwide 
without access to formal waste disposal options (Velis and Cook, 2021). 
Waste generation is expected to more than double globally by 2050 if the 
current trajectory is maintained (Kaza et al., 2018), which will certainly 
strain areas already struggling with waste accumulation. 
In Guatemala, HAP from both cooking activities and household 
garbage burning are prevalent. Approximately 50% of the total popu­
lation and 86% of the rural population, including the city of Jalapa, 
primarily relies on “polluting fuel” sources including biomass for 
cooking and heating [dataset] (World Health Organization, 2023). Ac­
cording to the Guatemala Population and Housing Census of 2018, 50% 
of the population of Jalapa burns their household waste on or near their 
property as a primary means of waste disposal [dataset] (National 
Institute of Statistics Guatemala, United Nations Population Fund 
UNFPA, 2018), likely due to the lack of infrastructure for waste man­
agement services. According to Hettiarachchi et al. (2018), only 25% of 
the total population of Guatemala has access to solid waste disposal 
services such as landfills and controlled dumps. Although open burning 
of household garbage presents a convenient way to self-manage waste, it 
increases the risk of harmful pollutant exposures through water, soil, 
and air (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019; Ramadan et al., 2022; Velis and 
Cook, 2021). 
A recent systematic review conducted by Velis and Cook explored the 
potential impacts of residential garbage burning on human health and 
synthesized evidence into eight groups of substance emissions, including 
PM2.5, PAHs, BPA, and phthalates. They found that individuals who 
were routinely in close proximity to burn piles, especially informal 
waste reclaimers (also referred to as “waste pickers”), were at the 
highest risk of exposure to an array of health-damaging air pollutants 
(Velis and Cook, 2021). This has implications for families who burn their 
own trash near their homes, though exposure assessment studies were 
not included in the review. 
PM2.5, BC, and PAHs are products of incomplete combustion gener­
ated from open waste burning and are associated with an array of 
adverse health effects (Arku et al., 2020; Dutta et al., 2020; Woolley 
et al., 2020; Velis and Cook, 2021). The chemical composition of the 
smoke from household garbage burning depends on a variety of factors 
including type of waste burned, environmental conditions, and burn 
frequency (Lemieux et al., 2004). A recent publication by Bardales Cruz 
and colleagues characterized emissions from domestic burning of plastic 
waste across 22 departments in Guatemala. They found that as much as 
30% of organic carbon, 24% of BC, 24% of PM2.5, and 2% of CO2 
emissions in Guatemala might not be accounted for by excluding open 
plastic burning from emissions inventories. Furthermore, the burning of 
plastic waste releases an array of other pollutants of potential health 
concern including ammonium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, antimony, and 
other trace elements (Bardales Cruz et al., 2023). 
Other pollutants generated by household garbage burning are plas­
ticizers and chemical additives such as phthalates and BPA. These 
chemicals are commonly added to plastic products to improve texture 
and rigidity and have the potential to leach into the environment as a 
result of incomplete combustion (Velis and Cook, 2021). Phthalates are 
also added to many consumer products including personal care products 
like soaps and hair products (Benjamin et al., 2017), pesticides, toys, and 
cosmetics (Zhang et al., 2022b). Long-term exposure to phthalates has 
been shown to impact pregnancy (Grindler et al., 2018; Wang and Qian, 
2021), child growth and development, and reproductive systems in 
young children and adolescents (Benjamin et al., 2017; Wang and Qian, 
2021). Exposure to these chemicals can occur through ingestion, inha­
lation, or dermal contact (Benjamin et al., 2017). 
BPA is a plasticizer added to products such as baby bottles, water 
bottles, food and beverage containers, toys, glasses, and CDs (Ma et al., 
2019). Exposure can occur dermally or through the ingestion of food or 
drinks that have been packaged in or come into contact with BPA 
(Cimmino et al., 2020; Geens et al., 2009; Grindler et al., 2018). BPA 
interacts with various biological receptors including estrogen receptors 
and has been associated with breast cancer development (Ma et al., 
2019). Both BPA and phthalates have been proposed in the etiology of 
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls (Akgül et al., 
2019). Inhalation exposures are also possible through exposure to 
BPA-containing dust particles or through burning products made with 
BPA, though more studies are needed to understand the associated 
health impacts upon exposure (Abraham and Chakraborty, 2020; 
Vasiljevic and Harner, 2021). 
HAP exposure assessment and health effects studies related to 
cooking practices in Guatemala are abundant in the literature (Johnson 
et al., 2021; McCracken John P. et al., 2007; Pope et al., 2015; Smith 
et al., 2010, 2011; Weinstein et al., 2017, 2020). Women and children 
are the populations typically prioritized in HAP studies because they 
typically spend more time at home and near the stove, compared to men 
(Hollada et al., 2017). However, limited evidence exists in the literature 
of HAP exposure assessment in young adults or adolescents (Huang 
et al., 2019; Murawski et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 
2022a), despite the knowledge that adolescent girls often help with 
household tasks including cooking and garbage burning. HAP exposure 
assessment studies in adolescent girls in LMICs, where residential 
biomass and garbage burning are both prevalent, are even less common 
(Huang et al., 2019). 
Given the ubiquity of plastic waste and the prevalence of HAP and 
household garbage burning in Guatemala, we sought to characterize 
K.A. Kearns et al.

exposures experienced by adolescent girls in Jalapa, Guatemala to 
PM2.5, BC, PAHs, phthalates, and BPA. For this pilot study, we leveraged 
the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) randomized 
controlled trial to recruit girls from the control (biomass stove) and 
intervention (liquefied petroleum gas; LPG stove) arms to compare ex­
posures. We assessed their exposures to PM2.5 and BC, collected real- 
time kitchen area BC concentrations, and analyzed urinary biomarkers 
of exposure to PAHs (markers for both HAP and garbage burning), and 
biomarkers of phthalates and BPA to assess exposures to plastics. We 
also collected survey data to assess other potential dietary, dermal, and 
inhalation exposures to measured pollutants. This pilot study aims to 
address important knowledge gaps in personal exposures to HAP and 
garbage burning in adolescent girls in rural areas of LMICs. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study setting 
This pilot study was nested within the HAPIN trial, which has been 
described in detail previously (Clasen et al., 2020, 2022; Johnson et al., 
2021) and summarized briefly here. The HAPIN trial took place between 
2017 and 2022 in four LMICs: Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. 
HAPIN households (n = 3200 total, n = 800 per study site) were ran­
domized into either the control arm, continued use of a biomass stove (n 
= 1607), or the intervention arm, free LPG stove and gas for 18 months 
(n = 1593). The HAPIN trial characterized 24 h personal exposures in 
pregnant women and kitchen concentrations of PM2.5 and BC pre- and 
post-intervention. For this pilot study, we recruited 60 adolescent girls 
residing in HAPIN households at the Guatemala site in rural Jalapa. 
The protocol for this study has been reviewed and approved by 
institutional review boards (IRBs) or Ethics Committees at Emory Uni­
versity (00109014) and Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (198-05- 
2019). The HAPIN trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(Identifier NCT02944682). All participants provided written informed 
consent. 
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
We sought to recruit 60 girls, 30 each from the control and inter­
vention arms. Researchers were blinded to intervention status through 
the data collection period and until a certain stage of data analysis. In­
clusion criteria were female, ages 13–17 years, residence in households 
participating in the HAPIN trial, and routine participation in cooking 
meals at home. Exclusion criteria were known pregnancy, self-reported 
current cigarette smoker, or plans to move temporarily or permanently 
outside the study area during the time of the study. 
2.3. Questionnaire 
In total, 56 of the 60 participants met eligibility criteria for the study. 
Two of the four ineligible participants did not meet age criteria and two 
did not regularly participate in cooking activities. An additional 
participant refused to provide a urine sample, and her instrument also 
failed during the air monitoring period, leaving us with a total sample 
size of 55 participants. Written consent to participate in the study was 
provided by a parent or guardian at the time of recruitment. All eligible 
participants were informed of study objectives, time commitment, 
benefits, and risks of the study. 
Local, trained fieldworkers verbally administered a baseline survey 
questionnaire in Spanish to collect sociodemographic information, 
household and stove characteristics, perception of waste generation and 
disposal in the community, health effects related to HAP exposure, and 
sources of HAP in and outside the home. Another survey was adminis­
tered the following day when urine samples were collected to determine 
potential sources of exposure that occurred during the previous 48 h (24 
h during the monitoring period and the 24 h preceding the monitoring 
period), to best attempt to capture the various exposure types). Re­
sponses were recorded on tablets and saved on REDCap™ (Harris et al., 
2009, 2019). 
2.4. Exposure assessment and sampling strategy 
2.4.1. Personal exposure assessment and laboratory analysis of PM2.5 
Personal exposure to PM2.5 was assessed on all participants using the 
Triplex Personal Sampling Cyclone (Mesa Labs) and Casella Tuff Pro 
pump (Casella, Buffalo, NY, USA). Pre-weighed Teflon filters with a 
diameter of 37 mm (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA) were 
loaded into a plastic cassette (SKC Limited, United Kingdom) and affixed 
to the aluminum cyclone. The cyclone and filter apparatus were con­
nected to the pump via tubing. The pump/cyclone system weighs about 
450 g total and was calibrated at a flow rate of 1.5 L min−1. The in­
struments were calibrated before each deployment, and the flow rate 
was recorded at the field station before and after the sampling period to 
determine the average sample flow rate. 
At the start of the sample period in the home, trained field staff 
turned on the air sampling equipment and placed the pump into a small 
backpack. The tube and cyclone were affixed along the strap of the 
backpack such that the filter was placed in the participant’s approximate 
breathing zone. The participant was asked to wear the backpack at all 
times, unless she were to engage in an activity which might damage the 
equipment such as bathing or sleeping and was instructed to keep the 
backpack within a meter of her person during these activities. 
The instruments were stopped by a field technician when they 
returned after 24 h to collect the equipment. The sampling equipment 
was carried back to the field office and filters were removed from the 
cyclones in a clean laboratory. Filters were placed in labeled petri dishes 
and refrigerated at 4 ◦C until they were hand-carried in coolers with blue 
ice by a traveler to the University of Georgia (UGA; Athens, GA, USA) for 
analysis. We followed the HAPIN protocol for gravimetric analysis of 
PM2.5 and optical transmission of BC for personal exposure assessment, 
as described in detail elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2020). 
2.4.2. Measurement of real-time kitchen area BC 
We measured 24-h real-time BC concentrations in the kitchens of 20 
participants (n = 10 control and n = 10 intervention homes) using the 
Model AE51 microAeth Black Carbon aerosol monitor (Aethlabs, Inc., 
range: 0–1 mg m−3, resolution: 0.001 mg m−3, flow rate: 50 mL min−1). 
The microAeth was deployed in the kitchen 0.5 m above the ground near 
the stove and was loaded with a Teflon-coated glass fiber filter strip prior 
to deployment (Pallflex Fiberfilm T60A20, Pall Life Sciences, MI, USA). 
The monitor draws air into an inlet 3 mm in diameter with a built-in 
pump and measures the rate of light absorption as aerosols deposit on 
the filter at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 and a time interval of 60 s. The 
absorbance of the sample area of the filter is therefore measured once 
every 60 s relative to a reference portion of the filter paper. These pa­
rameters were chosen based on the manufacturer’s instructions to 
optimize performance of the microAeth in this particular study setting. 
The BC data was post-processed using an Optimized Noise-reduction 
Averaging (ONA) algorithm as recommended by the manufacturer. 
2.4.3. Urinary biomarkers of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA 
The phthalates of interest for this study are commonly described in 
the literature (Benjamin et al., 2017; Radke et al., 2020) and include 
metabolites of the parent compounds di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and 
diethyl phthalate (DEP). Thus, the measured metabolites for this study 
were mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), 
mono-2-carboxymethylhexyl phthalate (MCMHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-ca 
rboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phtha­
late (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-2-ethyl-5- 
oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEP), 
mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP).

The metabolites measured in this study include 1-napthol, 2-naph­
thol, 2- and 3-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxypyrene, and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4- 
hydroxyphenanthrene. PAHs like these that are composed four rings or 
less (classified as low molecular weight PAHs) are more readily excreted 
in the urine (Yang et al., 2021), and thus were the target metabolites for 
this study. 
Participants were instructed to collect the first urine in the morning 
at the end of the 24-h sample period in a provided plastic urine collec­
tion container (previously tested to be BPA and phthalate-free). Field 
blanks were collected alongside of urine samples for quality assurance 
purposes to assess potential field contamination. Urine samples were 
collected from all participants when the technicians returned to pick up 
air monitoring equipment. Samples were transported to the field labo­
ratory and were processed within 8 h of collection. Samples were stored 
in the laboratory’s freezer at −20 ◦C until shipment to Emory University 
within 6 months of collection (Atlanta, GA, USA). 
All urine samples were randomized using a Fisher-Yates shuffling 
algorithm prior to analysis to reduce any potential batch effects. A 0.5- 
mL aliquot of urine was spiked with isotopically labeled analogues of the 
target phthalates and phenols and then was subjected to an enzyme 
hydrolysis to liberate glucuronide-bound conjugates. The hydrolysate 
was extracted using an ABS Elut-NEXUS solid phase extraction column, 
eluting with acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. The extract was concentrated 
to dryness and reconstituted in mobile phase for analysis using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using two 
separate injections and acquisition methods. 
Analyte concentrations were calculated using isotope dilution cali­
bration. Two quality control materials (one high and one low) and one 
blank sample were analyzed concurrently with each set of 28 unknown 
samples. Further quality assurance measures were included in the 
sample analyses including the analysis of NIST SRM 3672 and 3673 (one 
of each per 50 samples), and bi-annual participation in the German 
External Quality Assessment Scheme (G-EQUAS). Specific gravity was 
measured using a refractometer. 
All metabolite concentrations were adjusted for measured creatinine 
concentrations to account for variability in the volume of urine and the 
concentrations of endogenous and exogenous chemicals from void to 
void (Barr et al., 2005). 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0 and later (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, 253 Vienna, Austria). We calcu­
lated descriptive statistics for each of the pollutants. For the urinary 
biomarkers (phthalates, BPA, and PAHs; n = 55) we calculated the 
geometric mean (95% confidence interval; CI), median (interquartile 
range; IQR), the 90th and 95th percentiles, and the minimum and 
maximum concentrations. For the air monitoring data (personal PM2.5 
and BC and kitchen BC), we calculated the median and IQR by study 
arm. For PM2.5, we also evaluated the percentage of samples that were 
below the World Health Organization’s Annual Interim Target 1 (IT-1) 
for exposures, which is 35 μg/m3 (World Health Organization, 2021). 
Differences in exposures between assigned treatment arm were 
evaluated using non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank Sum), given that 
the data did not follow the assumptions of normality. Biomarker data 
were natural log-transformed before testing associations between

reported dermal, ingestion and inhalation exposures and measured 
pollutant concentrations using linear regression. 
For the biomarker data, we also compared metabolite concentrations 
of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA between our participants (stratified by 
study arm) and age- and sex-matched participants of the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a U.S.-based survey. 
3. Results 
3.1. Household and participant characteristics 
Household and participant characteristics, as well as exposures to 
HAP and plastics stratified by study arm, are provided in Table 1. Par­
ticipants were split 53% control and 47% intervention. The median age 
for each group was similar (14–15 years), and the majority of partici­
pants (65%) were currently in school. Most participants (98%) reported 
feeling that their community has a waste disposal issue and that there 
was nowhere to properly dispose of accumulated garbage. 
Burning trash was reported to be the preferred method of household 
garbage management by 76% of participants, which was similar be­
tween study arm (79% of control homes and 73% of intervention 
homes). Participants observed the most trash on the main road in their 
respective communities (82%), compared to their own yards, church, 
school, and public land. The most commonly observed types of trash 
reported by participants were snack wrappers (47%) and plastic bottles 
(33%). 
3.2. Participant reported exposures over previous 48 h 
After the 24-h sample period, the field staff returned to collect 
exposure monitors and urine samples and administer questionnaires. At 
this visit, participants were asked to recount their exposures over the 
previous 48 h (during the 24-h sample period as well as the day before 
sampling began). These results are presented in Table 1. 
Nearly all control participants (n = 28; 97%) and nine of the inter­
vention participants (35%) reported that they had been around an open 
fire within the previous 48 h. This could have been interpreted as the 
cooking fire (particularly for control participants), or any other open fire 
inside or outside the home. The average time spent around the open fire 
was 63 min (range: 1–420 min) for control participants and 8 min 
(range: 0–60 min) for intervention participants (results not shown). 
Twelve control (41%) and 1 intervention participant (4%) reported they 
had burned garbage in an outdoor burn pile, and 10 of those 12 control 
participants reported that the trash included plastic. The average 
amount of time spent burning trash among the control participants was 
9 min (range: 1–30 min), and the single intervention participant re­
ported spending 10 min burning trash (results not shown). 
3.3. Urinary biomarkers analysis 
For the biomarkers analysis, one sample was missing due to partic­
ipant refusal to provide the urine sample, resulting in a total sample size 
of 55. Descriptive statistics for BPA, phthalates, and PAH urinary 
metabolite concentrations are provided in Table 3. 
3.3.1. PAHs 
Nine hydroxylated urinary PAH metabolites were analyzed, and re­
sults are shown in Fig. 1. Due to the inability to isometrically separate 
some of the metabolites, 2- and 3-hydroxyfluroene and 2- and 3-hydrox­
yphenanthrene were combined to equal seven total individual mea­
surements. PAH metabolite concentrations were lower (p < 0.001) for 
each of the seven metabolites in intervention compared to control par­
ticipants. Conversely, metabolite concentrations were significantly 
higher in our participants regardless of study arm compared to age- and 
sex-matched participants of NHANES (n = 130), with the exception of 2- 
naphthol, where only the control arm was significantly higher than 
NHANES. 
3.3.2. Phthalates and BPA 
Phthalate and BPA exposures were not statistically different between 
study arms, thus results were pooled and compared to NHANES partic­
ipants (Fig. 2). Metabolite concentrations were elevated (p < 0.001) for 
MBP, MECPP, MEHHP, MEHP, and MEOHP in our participants 
compared to NHANES. We did not observe significant differences be­
tween our participants and NHANES participants for MiBP. For MEP, 
MBzP, and BPA, NHANES levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) 
compared to our participants. 
3.4. Air monitoring data for PM2.5 and BC 
We analyzed personal PM2.5 and BC exposures from 41 participants 
(n = 21 control, n = 20 intervention) and real-time BC in a subset of 20 
kitchens. 
3.4.1. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and BC 
We analyzed personal PM2.5 and BC exposures from 41 participants

(n = 21 control, n = 20 intervention; Fig. 3). Fifteen filters (27%) were 
removed from analysis due to instrument failure and thus, inability to 
determine total sample duration and final concentration. There was a 
significant reduction (Wilcoxon Rank Sum, p < 0.001) in personal PM2.5 
exposures in intervention participants (median 18.5 μg/m3, IQR 
11.1–53.0) compared to control participants (median 145 μg/m3, IQR 
32.0–199). Similarly, there was a significant reduction (Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum, p < 0.05) in personal BC exposures in intervention (median 2.24 
μg/m3, IQR 1.49–3.46) compared to control participants (median 10.0 
μg/m3, IQR 2.77–14.3). Compared to the WHO Annual IT-1 of 35 μg/m3 
for PM2.5, 65% of intervention participants and 29% of control partici­
pants and were below the guideline concentrations. 
3.4.2. Kitchen area BC concentrations 
Due to instrument availability, real-time BC was measured in 20 
kitchens (36%). Kitchen area BC concentrations were about five times 
lower on average in intervention (n = 10) compared to control kitchens 
(n = 10) (Fig. 3). Median concentrations were similar for personal and

kitchen BC concentrations in the control participants (10.0 vs. 11.1 μg/ 
m3) and the intervention participants (2.24 vs. 2.03 μg/m3), despite 
using different instrumentation and sampling methods. 
3.5. Modeling results 
Table 2 summarizes the regression results of associations between 
different dermal, ingestion, and inhalation exposures and measured 
pollutant concentrations. Pollutant concentrations were natural log (ln)- 
transformed given the non-normal distribution of the data. For linear 
regression, ln-transformed pollutants were the dependent (y) variable, 
and the independent (x) variables were participant-reported exposures 
from the survey questionnaire. 
For BPA, concentrations were 66% higher (p = 0.02) in participants 
who reported using cosmetics during the 48-h sample window. No 
additional significant associations were found between BPA and other 
potential sources, although the relationship between burning plastic 
trash in an open fire was associated with elevated BPA concentrations

Associations between reported dermal, ingestion, and inhalation exposures with air pollutant and chemical plasticizer concentrations over 48 h period. Note: We did 
not test for associations if fewer than five participants reported affirmative exposures. This included use of sunscreen, insecticide, baby powder, or drinking at least one 
canned beverage during the 48-hr timeframe. CI: 95% Confidence Intervals. % diff: Percent Difference.

with nominal statistical significance (62% difference; p = 0.07). 
Phthalate metabolite concentrations were 63% higher in participants 
who had reported using hair products (shampoo, conditioner, hair 
spray, etc.) during the 48-h period. The nine individual phthalate me­
tabolites were regressed with the “hair products” variable and MEOHP 
was specifically associated with hair product use (p = 0.05; data not 
shown). The association between MBzP and hair products was nomi­
nally significant (p = 0.08; data not shown). 
Personal PM2.5 concentrations were 2.84 times higher (p = 0.004) in 
participants who reported having been around an open fire. Concen­
trations were 2.31 times higher (p = 0.02) in participants who had 
burned trash in a burn pile, and 3.32 times higher (p = 0.007) in par­
ticipants who said the burn pile contained plastic trash compared to 
participants who had reported not receiving the same exposures. Results 
are similar and statistically significant (p < 0.05) for personal BC and 
PAH metabolites for the same sources of exposure (see Table 2). 
4. Discussion 
We found that adolescent girls participating in our study had 
significantly reduced exposures to PM2.5, BC, and PAHs in the inter­
vention arm compared to the control arm. We also measured detectable 
levels of phthalate and BPA metabolites in urine samples, some of which 
were higher than our reference NHANES population, and some of which 
were related to burning trash and cosmetics use. 
We observed substantial median reductions of PM2.5 (−86%) and BC 
(−80%) exposures in intervention compared to control participants. 
These findings are consistent with similar studies comparing exposures 
in women who are primary cooks using biomass stoves compared to LPG 
stoves (Grajeda et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2021; Thornburg et al., 
2022; Weinstein et al., 2020). The results are comparable to the overall 
HAPIN study (Johnson et al., 2021), where a 74% reduction in exposures 
in intervention compared to control participants in Jalapa was reported. 
Intervention participants also had substantially reduced (−72%) 
median urinary PAH concentrations compared to control participants. 
These findings are even more drastic than the 37% reduction found by 
Weinstein and colleagues in pregnant women in rural Guatemala using 
LPG compared to wood (Weinstein et al., 2020). This may be explained 
by the abundant free fuel delivered to homes in the HAPIN trial, while 
other studies limited the provision of free LPG fuel leaving houses to rely 
on a combination of fuels for daily cooking. Chen et al. also found sig­
nificant reductions (p < 0.05) in urinary PAH concentrations in rural 
Chinese participants using LPG compared to wood, although percent 
reductions were not given (Chen et al., 2017). 
Other than inhalation exposure from combustion sources, exposure 
to PAHs can occur through diet, specifically from eating grilled or 
charred foods (Hamidi et al., 2022). Tortillas are a staple food in 
Guatemala, and >50% of control participants and exactly 50% of 
intervention participants reported having eaten charred or burnt torti­
llas in the 48 h prior to urine sample collection. In this study, however, 
we did not find associations between participants’ report of eating 
charred or burnt tortillas and PAH concentrations as we did for PAHs 
and the inhalation exposures. This is consistent with the findings of 
similar studies (Weinstein et al., 2017, 2020). 
BPA exposures in our participants were mainly attributed to general 
cosmetics use (p = 0.02), though borderline significance (p = 0.07) was 
found in relation to burning plastic trash in an open fire. Studies 
measuring BPA exposures in LMICs, especially in the context of HAP, are 
rare in the literature. A recent study that is relevant to ours was con­
ducted by Rodríguez-B´aez et al. (2022) in Mexico, where they measured 
urinary concentrations of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA in 45 indigenous 
women ages 24–79 years. In this study, behaviors that may lend to ex­
posures to the pollutants of interest were smoking (9%), burning 
garbage (98%), using firewood for cooking (100%), and using plastic 
containers for food storage (100%). Median (IQR) creatinine-adjusted 
urinary BPA concentrations were 0.6 (0.4–2.0) μg/g creatinine, which 
is slightly higher than our findings of 0.45 (0.24–0.68) μg/g creatinine. 
In both studies, the urine sample was collected after an overnight fasting 
period (i.e., first morning void). 
The biological half-life of both phthalates and BPA are believed to be 
only about 5 h (Galloway et al., 2018; Genuis et al., 2012; Wittassek and 
Angerer, 2008), meaning that substantial variations in urinary levels are 
likely; moreover, levels that are measured will relate to only current or 
recent exposures (Krishnan et al., 2010). This introduces substantial 
challenges and warrants caution when comparing results to other 
studies, especially ones that vary in design and population. Rodrí­
guez-B´aez’s study differs from ours in that it was an observational study 
without air monitoring data, and no measures of association were re­
ported between urinary metabolite concentrations and the potential 
sources of exposures listed. 
Rodríguez-B´aez et al. (2022) also measured urinary concentrations 
for four of the same phthalate metabolites as our study – MEHP, MBP, 
MiBP, and MBzP – in addition to the BPA already discussed. With the 
exception of MiBP, which was approximately six times higher in our 
participants, the findings of Rodríguez-B´aez and colleagues were orders 
of magnitude higher than ours, and authors also noted that they were 
“impressively higher” than previous reports. In addition to differences in 
metabolism of phthalates in humans, another potential explanation the 
authors present for the high concentrations of phthalates in their study is 
the high prevalence of recycled plastics in the country. Mexico has been 
recognized as a leading recycler of plastics in the Latin America region, 
and recycled plastics are an important source of the parent compound 
DEHP, as it has been shown to be higher in recycled plastics compared to 
first-use plastics (Rodríguez-B´aez et al., 2022). Overall, both our study 
and the Rodríguez-B´aez study underscore the importance of assessing 
exposures in these understudied and vulnerable populations. 
Compared to our reference NHANES population, five of the nine 
urinary phthalate metabolites analyzed (MBP, MEHHP, MEOHP, MEHP, 
and MECPP) were statistically significantly higher in our participants. 
MEHHP, MEOHP, MEHP, and MECPP have the same parent compound 
(DEHP), which is the most common member of the chemical class of 
phthalates and is widely used in plastic products (Carli et al., 2022). 
Participants in our study had variable personal care product and 
cosmetic use, but they reported that their community had no waste 
sanitation services and they observed an accumulation of plastic bottles 
and snack wrappers. These results illustrate the prevalence of plastics 
and their breakdown products in the environment, especially in places 
like Jalapa where municipal sanitation services are largely not available. 
Furthermore, while the United States and many countries of the Euro­
pean Union have restrictions for the use of some phthalates in consumer 
products, such regulatory infrastructure is not in place in many LMICs 
(Wang et al., 2019). 
To our knowledge, this pilot study is the first to conduct compre­
hensive personal exposure assessment to HAP and measure urinary 
metabolites of plastics in adolescent girls in a rural setting where both 
biomass cookstoves and garbage burning are prevalent. Although a 
small study, we were able to leverage the HAPIN trial’s participating 
households, which demonstrated excellent adherence to the LPG stove 
in intervention households (Quinn et al., 2021). Thus, we were able to 
see substantial reductions in the adolescents in the intervention group in 
the air pollutant results for PM2.5, BC, and PAHs, although the urinary 
biomarkers results for BPA and phthalates were less clear. 
Cosmetic (foundation, compact powder, blush, eyeliner, mascara, 
lipstick, eyeshadow, and nail polish) and personal care product use 
during the 48-h time period was highly variable among our participants. 
More than half of our participants (53%) reported that they never use 
cosmetics, and only one participant used some cosmetics on a daily 
basis. Despite this, we were still able to see a relationship between 
cosmetic use and BPA concentrations. 
Lotion, hair products, and deodorant were the personal care products 
used by at least 50% of participants during the sampling timeframe. For 
hair products, we were able to relate exposure to total phthalates and

specifically, to MEOHP, but we did not observe associations between 
any other metabolite and personal care products. The short half-lives 
coupled with variable cosmetic and personal care product use, and 
small sample size of the study, may explain these findings. 
Though we observed substantial reductions in the HAP data by study 
arm (PM2.5, BC, and PAHs), 36% of all participants (n = 20) reported 
burning trash including plastic at a frequency of at least twice per week 
during the baseline survey questionnaire. Whether a participant burned 
trash during our particular sample period was due to chance. Addi­
tionally, for those that reported burning trash within our 48-h sample 
period, they reported spending only about 10 min on average around the 
burn pile. For these reasons, the potential impacts of plastic trash 
burning in the community of Jalapa may not have been adequately 
characterized due to the inability to capture all burning events during 
the specified sample period and in this small sample size. 
This study was an informative pilot study and, to our knowledge, one 
of the most comprehensive in terms of pollutants measured, but we were 
met with several limitations. In addition to the inherent limitations of 
short biological half-lives of some of the metabolites as previously dis­
cussed, this was a small, convenience sample, which may have led to 
either an over- or underestimation of the results. Moreover, cross- 
sectional studies such as ours only capture current exposures during a 
specific window of time and may not be representative of daily, cumu­
lative exposures. The statistical analyses also relied heavily on survey 
data, which is inherently prone to recall and/or social desirability bias. 
Given that BPA can leach into food and drinks, especially when the 
food and drinks are hot and come into contact with BPA-containing 
plastics, a missed opportunity we found with our questionnaire was 
not asking participants whether they had consumed hot beverages such 
as coffee from plastic cups. Furthermore, although we asked about fre­
quency of garbage burning in participants’ households as part of the 
baseline survey questionnaire, garbage burning at any frequency was 
not part of the inclusion criteria, meaning that we only captured burning 
events in the households that happened to take place during the sample 
period. Despite this, we still were able to capture instances of garbage 
burning in our small study population and during the specified sample 
period. These specific limitations have been remedied in the subsequent 
village level cluster-randomized trial which expands upon this work in 
the same region of Guatemala (ECOLECTIVOS; NCT05130632). 
Despite these limitations, this study showed that switching from 
biomass fuels to cleaner fuels such as LPG can significantly reduce ex­
posures to harmful pollutants in young women of reproductive age. 
Cosmetics and some personal care products contributed to BPA and 
phthalate exposures, highlighting the ubiquitous nature of these chem­
icals in everyday products used by young women. More research is 
needed to accurately characterize cumulative exposures to these prod­
ucts in LMICs. Time-activity studies of HAP and household garbage 
burning, especially in these understudied areas, would also help eluci­
date the acute as well as cumulative exposures. Although it was beyond 
the scope of this study, it will be important for future studies to isolate 
the health impacts adolescent girls experience when exposed to air 
pollutants from garbage burning, including plastic. 
5. Conclusion 
This study characterized exposures to HAP from cookstoves and 
garbage burning, including plastic burning, among adolescent girls in 
rural Guatemala. We conducted 24-h personal air monitoring of PM2.5 
and BC and analyzed urinary biomarkers of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA. 
We observed exposure reductions to PAHs, PM2.5, and BC in adolescents 
residing in homes that had been randomized to an LPG intervention 
compared to homes who continued cooking with traditional biomass 
stoves. We observed elevated levels of some urinary phthalate metabo­
lites compared to U.S. participants in NHANES, and found detectable 
levels of BPA, which was associated with cosmetics use. This pilot study 
contributes to an area of the literature that is currently lacking, and 
paves the way for future work, namely the ECOLECTIVOS trial, in low 
resource settings where biomass and household garbage burning are 
prevalent.

of their owners

The aim of the study was to determine the scale of emission and airborne dispersion of selected 
pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, TVOC, HCHO) associated with the combustion of various types of municipal 
waste (MW), its mixed stream and separate fractions, in a household furnace, as compared to 
conventional (CF) and alternative (AF) fuels. We demonstrated that each type of fuel (AF, CF, AFw) 
combusted in a household furnace is a significant source of air pollutants, especially fine PM2.5 
particles, whose concentrations exceeded the limit values (3.1–17.2 times for PM2.5 and 0.5–7.4 times 
for PM10). The combustion of MW in household furnaces generated higher levels of PM2.5 (up to 
345 µg/m3) and PM10 (up to 369 µg/m3) than AF or CF, at the same time being a significant source of 
TVOC (up to 0.3 mg/m3) and HCHO (0.4 mg/m3). The analysis showed that according to the Polish and 
European classification, air quality (AQI) during the combustion of all the materials analyzed is very 
poor (n = 12) or extremely poor (n = 19). The combustion of such materials as polystyrene, rubber and 
upholstery foam in household furnaces generates drastically high health risk to local inhabitants. We 
found that the combustion of polystyrene generated the highest Cancer Risk (CR) values of 1.04E-01 
(children) and 2.60E-02 (adults), exceeding the acceptable level multiple times (CR > 10–6). Inhalation 
exposure to very poor air quality can lead to health problems, such as disorders of the respiratory, 
cardiovascular and immune systems. Additional risk is posed by solid fuel combustion in rural areas, 
which may be a significant factor deteriorating the chemical condition of soils, especially those used for 
agricultural purposes.
Keywords  PM2.5, PM10, TVOC, HCHO, Health risk
Out of all contemporary environmental factors, air pollution has the greatest negative impact on human life and 
health1–3. Depending on the type and time of exposure to harmful substances in the air, people may suffer from 
various conditions, which can even lead to diseases, predominantly of the circulatory and respiratory systems, 
but also the reproductive and nervous systems4–6. Air pollution is most harmful to children, the elderly and the 
chronically ill7,8. According to statistical data for Poland, almost 30% of children under the age of 2 and over 50% 
of the population over 60 years of age receive continuous medical care9. It is estimated that several million people 
around the world die every year due to poor air quality10–12.
Poland is a European country where there is still much to be done with regard to air quality improvement13–15. 
Air quality in Polish cities is among the poorest in the European Union16. This pertains to the above-standard 
levels of such substances as PM10 and PM2.5 particulates and benzo(a)pyrene. In 2011, six out of ten European 
cities having the highest number of days with exceeded permissible daily concentration of PM10 were located 
in Poland17. Undoubtedly, this stems from the fact that fossil fuels are the main materials for the energy sector, 
which are used e.g., for the heating of households and public institutions 18. Although the data refers to a situation 
from over 10 years ago, air quality in Polish cities has remained poor or very poor17. Therefore, the country 
had to take corrective action in terms of reducing low emissions (anti-smog resolutions requiring furnace and 
coal boiler replacement), installing renewable sources of energy systems (i.e., the use of biogas, installation of 
photovoltaic panels, solar collectors, heat pumps), heating residential and public buildings, and expanding the 
district heating and gas network19. Measures taken to reduce transportation emissions have mainly focused on 
the purchase of low- or zero-emission public transportation buses, construction of new routes for public and 
bicycle transportation, modernization and repair of tramway tracks, creation of paid parking zones and more 
frequent removal of dust accumulated on the roads. Actions taken to reduce industry emissions have included

inspections at particularly harmful plants, implementation of the best available techniques (BAT) and creation of 
an emission database based on the permits issued for the largest industrial plants. These activities are sanctioned 
by relevant legislation.
In terms of the air quality law, and in particular the reduction of low emissions, two European Union directives 
are of greatest importance. The first one is Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe20, also called the CAFE Directive (Clean 
Air for Europe). It is the main legal act in the European Union concerning the reduction of emissions of such 
pollutants as: PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2, NOx, CO, Pb and C6H6. The second act is Directive 2004/107/EC of 
the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 relating to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel 
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in ambient air21. It concerns the reduction of PAH emissions, 
especially B(a)P, generated mainly in the household and municipal waste sector. It sets out the target values for 
As, Cd, Ni and B(a)P measured in PM10, the number of sampling points, the criteria for selecting their location, 
the data quality required and the reference measurement methods.
Poor air quality is largely due to PM10, PM2.5 and benzo(a)pyrene in PM10, which are mainly emitted as 
a result of burning low-quality fuels in households1,22–25. What is also observed in Poland is the practice of 
burning municipal waste in household furnaces18, although it raises many controversies and is legally prohibited 
by national and local law26. Household furnaces are mainly charged with solid fuels, i.e., hard coal, wood or 
wood pellets. Sadly, it is still common to encounter illegal practices of burning selected fractions of municipal 
waste in these furnaces. The quality and quantity of waste generated from combustion, i.e., ash, depends on the 
thermal decomposition technology (technological parameters of the boiler) and the type of the raw material 
used in the system18,27.
In rural areas in Poland, the proportion of municipal waste in the total waste collected is decreasing, unlike 
in the other European countries28. This decline does not result from green behavior, whose aim is to reduce 
waste generation, but stems from the fact that some waste fractions, or worse—their mixed stream, are burnt in 
household furnaces. This action is aimed at reducing the cost of heating by using the heat obtained from burning 
this “free furnace fuel”. According to a study by Lim et al.24, this practice is closely related to people’s income 
level and economic situation. As shown by Kicińska and Caba29, the toxic properties of ash are determined by its 
morphological and chemical composition. Compounds contained in ash are readily leached and dispersed in the 
water-soil environment. Excessive concentrations of these substances, i.e., sulfates, phosphates, chlorides, oxides 
of silicon, aluminum, magnesium, iron, and calcium, and potentially toxic elements, including: Cd, Cu, Ni, Cr, 
Zn etc., which are the main constituents of ash, have an adverse effect on the components of the environment, as 
demonstrated in studies by AlMulla et al.30 and Wei et al.31. These substances directly pollute the soil, water and 
air, and have an indirect effect on the entire ecosystem and the health of organisms living in it1,32,33.
The consumer market offers numerous classes of household furnaces (boilers) for burning various types 
of solid fuels, both conventional (hard coal, lignite) and alternative (coal pellets, pellets), as well as biomass 
(wood, green waste). However, these appliances are not suitable for burning waste, and especially not the mixed 
waste stream. There are various chemical reactions taking place in the combustion chamber (at a relatively low 
temperature of 250–480 ⁰C), which are associated with the presence of different materials (e.g., PVC, paints, 
adhesives, varnishes, solvents, plastics etc.). As a result, volatile compounds (e.g., formaldehyde or organic 
compounds) and harmful or even toxic substances are emitted through exhaust chimneys34,35.
In light of these facts, the main aim of the present study was to determine the emission and airborne 
dispersion of selected pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, HCHO – formaldehyde and TVOC – total volatile organic 
compounds) associated with the combustion of various types of municipal waste, its mixed stream and separate 
fractions, in a household boiler. The other research objective was to assess health risk associated with the effect 
of these pollutants on local inhabitants. An innovative element of the work is that it demonstrates the degree 
of harm caused by the combustion of individual fractions of municipal waste in inadequate systems, such as 
household furnaces.
Research area
The air quality analysis was conducted in the village of Żydów, located in Igołomia-Wawrzeńczyce commune, 
in Małopolska Province (Poland, EU). Igołomia-Wawrzeńczyce is a typically rural commune, with some extent 
of service and manufacturing activity. Agricultural land accounts for 90.5% of the commune’s area, forests and 
woodlands for 0.6% and surface water for 2.8%. Housing and transportation areas take up over 5.2% of the area 
and the remaining area (0.9%) is wasteland. The surface area of the village is 2 ha and the number of inhabitants 
is 188. About 90% of inhabitants have connections to mains gas. All the residential, public, and commercial and 
service buildings in the commune have individual heating systems powered by coal (80%) and gas (20%). All the 
public buildings have gas-fired boiler rooms.
The area’s climate is a combination of subcontinental and central European climate. The average daily 
temperature is 8.7 °C (13.3 °C during the day and 4.1 °C at night). The annual rainfall is 672 mm36. The heating 
season lasts from October to the end of April (7 months).
The selected air quality parameters were measured at six sampling points in Żydów (Fig. 1). Their selection 
was determined by: site accessibility, lack of tall vegetation, and location relative to the source of emissions 
(mainly due to the dominant wind direction, west: points 2 and 3, south-west: point 1, and north-east: points

sampling points 1–6 was as follows (data in m): 16.7, 53.3, 100, 16.7, 41.7 and 75.

Research materials and methods
The 32 materials (Table 1) incinerated in a Keller 10 kW chamber furnace (with nominal heating capacity of 
10 kW, efficiency of 80%, and maximum working pressure of 0.25 MPa) located in a private household were as 
follows:
•	 conventional fuels (CF, n = 3) comprising hard coal from various fuel storage sites,
•	 alternative fuels (AF, n = 8) including: coal pellets, wood pellets, straw and green waste,
•	 alternative fuels—wood (AFW, n = 5) including the wood of walnut Juglans L., willow Salix L;, acacia Acacia 
Mill. and oak Quercus L,
•	 mixed municipal waste (MMW, n = 3), comprising mixed samples of all waste fractions generated in house­
holds,
•	 municipal waste (MW, n = 11), comprising the following separately collected fractions: paper, textiles, ply­
wood, upholstery foam, artificial leather, rubber, polystyrene and PVC packaging (used to store mineral oils 
or plant protection agents).
The self‐ignition temperatures (data in °C) were as follows: 450–550 for hard coal, 250–280 for peat, 210–320 
for wood (different types), 230 for straw, 550 for coal pellets, and 180–260 for municipal waste (different types). 
A full description of the furnace charge preparation process has been provided in a paper by Kicińska and 
Caba37. The weight of the incinerated material, which had previously been fragmented, homogenized, reduced 
and divided into feed portions, was about 5 kg.
CF and AF were collected selectively (i.e., based on the type that is most commonly used in households in the 
study area). On the other hand, MW (dry fraction) was collected into a separate container and then processed 
by grinding or crushing. In this part of the study, maintaining similar combustion conditions was of utmost 
importance.
Statistical calculations and data presentation were conducted with the Statistic ver. 13.3 and Excel applications. 
The differences between means were detected by the Tukey HSD test at a significance level of 0.05. To analyze 
the possible effect of the burning of different materials on air quality parameters (PM2.5, PM10, HCHO and 
TVOC), as well as the possible influence of atmospheric conditions (wind direction, speed of wind [km/h], 
pressure [hPa], temperature [°C] and rain [mm]) recorded during sampling at different sampling points, a 
regression analysis was performed in R26. The lm() function within the Stats package was used for this purpose. 
This function allows the analysis of the effect on continuous variables (air quality parameters) produced by 
categorical or factor variables (i.e. fuel type, sampling point, wind direction) and numerical variables (wind 
speed, atmospheric pressure, temperature and precipitation). The application of this tool allows for determining 
whether the changes in the average concentration of the different atmospheric pollutants associated with the 
value of one of the categorical variables (for example, the burning of a certain fuel or a given sampling point) are 
statistically significant.

The air quality parameters measured were: PM2.5 and PM10 [measured in μg/m3], and HCHO and TVOC 
[mg/m3]. The measurement of each parameter was repeated twice and the result included in the analysis was 
the average value. The measurements were performed at six points (1–6, Fig. 1), during a heating period from 7 
January to 6 February 2022 using an air quality sensor Webber SP 86, at a fixed time, in the evening (6–8 PM). 
The measurements were taken at the height of 1.5 m above ground level. The detection limits for the sensor used 
were as follows: 0.1 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and PM10 and 0.001 mg/m3 for HCHO and TVOC. Typically, HCHO and 
TVOC are measured indoors. However, this time we decided to carry out the measurements outdoors.
Health risk assessment
The health risk assessment associated with the presence of a harmful substance/element is usually based on 
estimating the magnitude of the risk and classifying it as carcinogenic or non-carcinogenic. Non-carcinogenic 
risk (HQ) is determined by comparing the calculated doses of pollutants which entered the body via individual 
exposure routes (in this case, inhalation) with the corresponding reference doses (RfD). In turn, carcinogenic 
risk (CR) is estimated as the lifetime probability of developing cancer as a result of exposure to a given carcinogen 
through a given route of exposure.
Risk assessment for formaldehyde (HCHO)
Carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessment for HCHO was conducted using the methodology 
recommended by the US EPA38–42 To determine the value of health risk associated with inhalation exposure, 
inhalation exposure concentration (ECinh) was calculated using Eq. (1):

where ECinh—inhalation exposure concentration [μg/m3], C—concentration of HCOH in the air [μg/m3], ET—

It is assumed that if CR < 10–6, the risk is low or negligible; if CR falls in the range of 10–6 and 10–4, the risk is 
uncertain, and if CR > 10–4, corrective measures must be taken39,44,45).

It is accepted that at HQ ≤ 1 adverse health effects are unlikely, at HQ > 1 negative health effects are likely to 
occur.
Results and discussion
Air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, HCHO, TVOC) and the type of fuel combusted
Air quality measurements were carried out in the coldest months of the year, namely January and February 
(winter time). In the study area, this is the peak of the heating season, which determines air quality. The 
concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 at the six sampling points ranged from 62 to 345 µg/m3 and from 75 to 
369 µg/m3, respectively (Table 2). The levels of PM10 were higher than those of PM2.5 at nearly all sampling 
points. The finer fraction, i.e., PM2.5, accounted for an average of 91% of the PM10 fraction, which is consistent 
with the data published by Faria et al.4 and Yu et al.47. The coarse fraction also comprised larger particles, with 
a diameter of 2.5–10 µm, which are mineral particles lifted by wind from the ground. The proportion of these 
forms in the particulate matter in the winter time is small and, as shown in the present study, reaches only 9%. 
This result indicated, as expected, the dominant role of a point source of pollution, namely a chimney conveying 
exhaust gases and solid pollutants. The analysis showed that the impact of other sources of pollution in this area 
was small.
The obtained values (Table 2) significantly exceeded the limit values for PM2.5 and PM10 in the air set out 
for the protection of human health20,48,49, for the 24-h average, i.e., 20 and 50 µg/m3, for all materials (fuels) at all 
sampling points. In the case of PM2.5, the levels were exceeded 3.1–17.2 times and in the case of PM10, 0.5–7.4 
times (Fig. 2). The situation is very concerning, especially with respect to PM2.5. Particulates with a diameter 
smaller than 2.5 µm are atmospheric aerosols considered most harmful to human health, as they can easily and 
directly penetrate into the trachea or bronchi and consequently enter the bloodstream. Respirable dust particles 
play a role in the exacerbation of asthma, impaired lung function, lung, throat and larynx cancers, cardiac 
arrhythmias, vasculitis, atherosclerosis and low birth weight and respiratory problems in babies exposed to these 
particulates during fetal development4,6. They have also been reported to exacerbate circulatory and respiratory 
symptoms in people suffering a long-term exposure to these particulates10. In turn, PM10 are a mixture of 
suspended particles, whose diameter does not exceed 10 µm. Their detrimental effect is associated with the 
presence of other harmful substances, i.e. benzopyrenes, furans or dioxins, also in the form of potentially toxic 
elements (Zn, Tl, As, Pb, Cd or Hg). They negatively affect the respiratory system, being responsible for coughing 
attacks, wheezing, rapid bronchitis or the development of asthma. A study by Park et al.7 demonstrated that a 
long-term exposure to PM10 indirectly increases the risk of heart attack and stroke.
As already mentioned, the obtained values indicate that PM2.5 and PM10 levels exceeded the limit values 
at all sampling points and for all materials, regardless of whether these were conventional or alternative fuels 
(Fig.  2). The average PM2.5 and PM10 levels in the air after the combustion of individual groups of fuels 
decreased in the following order (PM2.5, PM10 – data in µg/m3): selected fractions of municipal waste (169, 
202) > conventional fuels – hard coal (133, 146) > wood – various species (130, 138) > mixed stream of municipal 
waste (121, 127) > alternative fuels – various types (106, 117).
The second group of air quality parameters measured were organic pollutants, i.e., formaldehyde (HCHO) 
and volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The first one—formaldehyde (methanal), is an organic compound 
formed during the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing substances. It is the key compound among 
the oxidized forms of volatile organic substances found indoors due to its presence in numerous materials 
(including varnishes, paints, and adhesives) and even preservatives. Therefore, multiple materials are saturated 
with formaldehyde. Our measurements showed that at all sampling points the concentration of this compound 
did not exceed 0.400 mg/m3, which is the odor detection threshold. In concentrations exceeding 0.01 ppm, 
formaldehyde may cause irritation of the epidermis, nasopharyngeal mucosa and eyes. According to the 
Scientific Reports |        (2024) 14:32011

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
guidelines by the German Ministry of the Environment50, formaldehyde levels should not exceed 0.1 mg/m3 in 
indoor air.
Volatile organic compounds (TVOC), the other indicator measured, have a high tendency to evaporate 
(especially at low temperatures), causing gaseous air pollution51,52. Our study showed that the air levels of TVOC 
levels ranged from trace amounts (< 0.001 mg/m3) to max. 0.3 mg/m3 (Table 2). It is believed that concentrations 
below 0.2 mg/m3 do not cause irritation or poor well-being, whereas levels in the range of 0.2–3.0 mg/m3 are 
conducive to irritation and well-being deterioration50. The WHO established an indoor air quality guideline of 
0.1 mg/m3for a 30-min exposure49.
Thus, HCHO and TVOC concentrations at selected sampling points exceeded the limit values (i.e., 0.01 and 
0.02 mg/m3, respectively). In the case of HCHO, this pertained to wood (different species), mixed municipal 
waste and some groups of municipal waste (i.e., PVC packaging, polystyrene, rubber and upholstery foam). As 
for TVOC, the limit values were exceeded in the case of mixed municipal waste and some fractions of municipal 
waste, i.e., PVC packaging, polystyrene, rubber, upholstery foam and furniture boards (Fig. 3). Some countries 
have set out standards for the limit values of TVOC, but these apply to indoor air quality. For example, the 
Chinese limit value for TVOC is 0.6 mg/m353, while relevant legislation in Germany specifies the following 
HCOH and TVOC concentrations (ppm): 0.001–0.4 and 0.3–1.2, respectively.
The average HCHO and TVOC levels in the air after the combustion of individual groups of fuels decreased 
in the following order (HCHO, TVOC – data in mg/m3): separate fractions of municipal waste (0.044,

0.041) > mixed stream of municipal waste (0.022, 0.018) > wood – different types (0.010, 0.005) > conventional 
fuels – hard coal (0.007, 0.002) > alternative fuels – different types (0.002, 0.002).
Having analyzed the impact of the combustion of conventional and alternative fuels on the amount of 
inorganic pollutants in the air, we found that CF generated the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (133 
and 146 µg/m3, respectively). In turn, the combustion of AF, such as coal pellets, straw, green waste or wood 
pellets, generated PM2.5 and PM10 amounts that were approximately 20% lower compared to CF (106 and 
117 µg/m3, respectively). A slightly different situation was observed for wood combustion (various types). Here, 
the PM2.5 and PM10 values were only slightly lower, by about 2% (130 and 138 µg/m3, respectively), than the 
results recorded for CF. For the wet wood sample, the values of PM2.5 and PM10 in the air were 10% higher than 
for the wood sample of the same species, but dried out.
As for organic pollutants, the highest concentrations in the air, both for HCHO and TVOC, were recorded 
after burning various wood species (AFw). The average concentrations of these parameters recorded for this entire 
group of fuels were 0.022 and 0.004 mg/m3, respectively, being 10- and twofold higher than the concentrations 
observed for other AF, and 3- and twofold higher than those recorded for CF. These relationships stem from the 
chemical composition of the primary materials. This is because the main mass of wood is comprised of organic 
substances consisting of 4 main elements: C (about 49.5%), H (6.3%) and O2 and N (44.2% in total, with the 
share of N being about 0.12%). The proportion of mineral matter is low and depends on the species of wood, 
but does not exceed 0.2–1.7 wt%54. In contrast, hard coal contains from 75% to as much as 97% of C, while 
other elements such as: H (2–6%), O2 (1–18%), N (0.5–2%) and S (0.2–2%) make up the rest of its chemical 
composition55,56. The high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) may be due to the high content (up 
to 40%) of mineral matter (ash – the residue from incomplete combustion), which is transferred to the external 
environment through the chimney57. The chemical composition of ash (composed mainly of Al, Fe, Si, Ca, Na, 
K, and S oxides and elements described as potentially toxic: Cu, Pb, Cd, Hg) and its effect on human health as 
well as environmental pollution have been the subject of numerous scientific studies58–62.
These differences have direct health implications for individuals breathing polluted air, especially in the long 
term. In terms of pollutant emissions (organic and inorganic) and their impact on human health, the least 
harmful fuels burned in household furnaces are coal pellets and wood pellets.
In summary, the combustion of individual fuel groups and the obtained PM2.5, PM10, HCOH and TVOC 
values showed that:
•	 the highest average concentrations (for all materials analyzed n = 32) were observed during the combustion 
of polystyrene; these were 249 and 281 µg/m3 (PM2.5, PM10) and 0.176 and 0.195 mg/m3 (HCOH, TVOC),

•	 in the MMW group, the highest concentrations were recorded for sample no. III (155, 149, 0.013 and 0.042, 
respectively); this was mixed waste collected in a detached house inhabited by two adults who frequently shop 
online,
•	 in the AF group, the highest concentrations were found during the combustion of green waste (120, 132, 
0.004, 0.004, respectively); its main constituents were dry kitchen waste and shrub and grass cuttings,
•	 in the AFw group, the highest concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and HCOH were recorded during the combus­
tion of wet willow wood (152, 166 µg/m3 and 0.23 mg/m3, respectively). For the sample of the same wood, but 
dried out, these values were on average 20% lower,
•	 in the CF group, for the two hard coal samples analyzed, the highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 
155 and 168 µg/m3, respectively, and those for HCOH and TVOC were 0.011 and 0.003 mg/m3, respectively.
Airborne dispersion of pollutants
A chimney discharging exhaust gases from a furnace (boiler), where the fuel combustion process takes place, is a 
typical point source of pollution. The airborne dispersion of harmful substances contained in the plume depends 
on the height reached by the exhaust gases, the size of their particles and climatic factors, i.e., atmospheric 
stability, humidity, and wind direction and speed63,64. The substances are mainly transported by wind and mix 
with the surrounding air, with the scattering taking place horizontally (this process occurs much faster and 
depends on the topography of the area) and vertically65,66.
To analyze air pollutant dispersion from a point source, we employed the Gaussian Dispersion Model, which 
uses a normal distribution curve (Gaussian distribution) to describe the concentration of harmful substances. 
The variables included in the analysis were the emission rate from the source and wind speed. Ground level 
concentration was calculated using Eq. (4).

In our study, we analyzed the concentrations of the substances in the air, but not at ground level, which is 
undoubtedly important in soil research, but at the level of a person’s mouth and nose (i.e., 1.5 m). The selection 
of the sampling points has been described in the previous subsection.
At the initial stage of the analysis, we verified whether there were any associations between the factors 
studied (Table 3, Fig. 4). The statistical analyses (i.e., correlation coefficients, cluster analysis and factor analysis) 
indicated that:
•	 atmospheric factors (such as wind speed and direction and temperature) play a major role in the dispersion 
of pollutants (Fig. 4B),
•	 wind direction plays a major role in PM2.5 and PM10 dispersion (Fig. 4A), which is consistent with the find­
ings obtained by Galán-Madruga et al.66,
•	 there is a very strong correlation between the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 (r = 0.88),
•	 there is a very strong correlation between the concentrations of HCHO and TVOC (r = 0.68), and between 
organic pollutants (HCHO and TVOC) and particulate matter pollutants (Tab. 4), r = 0.67 and 0.64 for PM2.5 
and r = 0.63 and 0.60 for PM10, respectively.
We analyzed pollutant dispersion for all the substances combusted (Fig. 5S). The analysis revealed that:
•	 under the same atmospheric conditions, particulate pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) disperse somewhat differ­
ently than organic pollutants (TVOC and HCHO). Organic pollutant plumes are considerably smaller and 
narrower (samples 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 16, 25, 26, 31, and 32) as compared to particulate matter plumes,
•	 PM2.5 and PM10 dispersion plumes for the majority of the materials analyzed are very similar (Fig. 5S),
•	 lack of wind is conducive to the formation of fog, i.e., no clear plume is observed (samples 27, 30),
•	 wind speed > 30 km/h causes rapid pollutant dispersion and the formation of a plume consistent with the 
predominant wind direction (samples 1, 2),
•	 organic pollutant dispersion is largely affected by low (negative) temperatures, which considerably enlarge the 
TVOC and HCHO dispersion plumes (samples 19, 20, 21).

Distributions of average pollutant concentrations emitted as a result of combusting all groups of the conventional, 
alternative and municipal waste fuels analyzed in the study have been presented in Fig. 5. Based on this data, we 
found that in the case of:
•	 CF and AF, the plumes for all the substances analyzed differed substantially, which may stem from the large 
variation between individual coal samples (CF) and differences between pollutant emissions during the com­
bustion of such materials as coal pellets, straw or green waste (AF),

•	 AFw, there was a difference between the organic pollutant plume and the particulate matter pollutant plume; 
in the case of the latter, the plume was much smaller (by ~ 20–50%) and narrower, with a slightly elongated 
shape (perpendicular to the predominant wind direction),
•	 MMW, the organic and particulate matter pollutant plumes were nearly identical and their direction was 
consistent with the predominant wind direction (SW); this is undoubtedly related to the stability of the at­
mosphere and the lowest average temperature (− 10 °C) recorded during the measurements,

Health risk associated with inhalation of polluted air
Health risk assessment relies on several key assumptions. These are based on toxicological testing carried out for 
individual substances43. Due to the fact that we did not measure the concentrations of individual constituents 
of PM2.5, PM10 and TVOC, and the registered values pertain to the entire group of compounds, it was not 
possible to carry out a full health risk assessment using generally accepted equations. This analysis could only be 
performed for formaldehyde (HCHO). Nevertheless, to assess the impact of the other parameters on the health 
of local inhabitants, we used the Air Quality Index (AQI) and the recommended limit values.
Formaldehyde
We calculated the carcinogenic health risk associated with the presence of formaldehyde in the air, following 
the combustion of various fuels, for two age groups: children and adults (“Health Risk Assessment” section). As 
mentioned in the method description, we assumed that children spend only 2 h a day outside during the heating 
season, whereas adults 5 h a day, which is related to e.g., the need to remove snow from the area around homes 
and to perform agricultural work associated with the late (autumn) harvesting of agricultural crops.
The obtained CR values for children and adults at all sampling points ranged as follows: 7.80E-04–1.04E-01 
and 6.50E-05–2.60E-02, respectively (Table S1). Values denoting low or negligible risk (CR < 10–6) were not 
observed for any of the substances combusted (although at several points, the level of pollutants was below the 
detection limit of the sensor). In turn, CR of 10–6–10–4 (uncertain risk) accounted for 77% of the values obtained 
for adults and 47.5% for children. Substances posing an uncertain risk during combustion were oak wood, straw, 
coal and wood pellets and green waste. CR > 10–4 denoting an unacceptable carcinogenic risk accounted for 23% 
and 52% of the values obtained for adults and children, respectively. These values pertained to the combustion 
of mixed municipal waste (samples 19 and 21) and PVC packaging, polystyrene, rubber, artificial leather and 
textiles. The combustion of polystyrene and rubber posed the highest health risk for adults. We found that the 
combustion of polystyrene generated the highest CR values of 1.04E-01 (children) and 2.60E-02 (adults). Such 
high values not only call for corrective action, but also point to the need of expanding research about the impact 
of this practice on other environmental components67.
Non-carcinogenic risk (HQ) calculated for formaldehyde fell within the range of 0.51–203 (adults) and 0.51–
814 (children). Only 33% and 15% of the values (for adults and children, respectively) met the methodologically 
assumed recommendation of HQ ≤ 1. It is concerning that 2% and 11% of the HQ values exceeded 100 and, 
in the case of children, 1% of the values exceeded 500. This occurred during the combustion of polystyrene 
and upholstery foam. This is not an unprecedented result in the scientific literature. Values as high as these 
(HQ = 214.2 for < 2 year-old children and HQ = 51.8 for 2–6 year-old children) have been reported by Li et al.68, 
who studied HCOH in indoor environments.
TVOC
We compared our measurements of TVOC concentrations in the air with relevant legal recommendations. 
However, the proposed limit values for TVOC refer to indoor air quality69. The first limit value 0.3 mg/m3 was 
proposed by Seifert70. However, it had not been determined based on toxicological studies. Another limit value 
was proposed in 200769. It was extended in terms of assessing the level of pollution with these compounds, as it 
presented five pollution levels and specific recommendations to be taken when such pollution occurs. However, 
it still did not address health risks.
Referring to these 5 levels of pollution—and their corresponding limit values of (mg/m3): < 0.3 (level I), 
0.3–1(level II), > 1–3 (level III), > 3–10 (level IV) and > 10–25 (level V), we determined that the maximum value 
of 0.3 mg/m3 points to a minimal presence of volatile organic compounds and the situation does not require 
any corrective measures to be taken. The Chinese legislation53 recommends the value of 0.6 mg/m3, which is 
considerably (two times) higher.
Air quality index—PM2.5 and PM10
The next step in the study involved the parametric assessment of air quality at the six sampling points. For this 
purpose, we calculated the Air Quality Index (AQI), as it is the easiest way to determine air pollution levels. The 
AQI values range between 0 and 500, and the higher the index, the more polluted the air. Our assessment was 
based on the particulate matter levels (PM2.5 and PM10), but it can also include other pollutants, i.e., SOx, NOx, 
CO, COx and O3, C6H6. AQIs for individual pollutants are calculated based on hourly concentrations of these 
compounds and assigned to a relevant category presented in the table of AQI ranges (Table 4). Next, the overall 
index takes the value of the worst individual index among the pollutants measured.
The analysis showed that according to the Polish and European classification, air quality (AQI) during 
the combustion of all the materials analyzed was very poor (n = 12) or extremely poor (n = 19) (Tab. 4). The 
exception was a sample of materials marked with number 18 (mixed municipal waste I), whose combustion 
resulted in medium AQI. Very poor AQI was obtained for all alternative fuels (coal pellets, straw, wood pellets, 
leaves and green waste). This means that pollution generated by burning these materials is so high that patients, 
the elderly, pregnant women, and small children should avoid staying outside and other people should minimize 
outdoor activity. Long-term inhalation exposure to air of quality like this increases the risk of changes in the 
respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems.
Extremely poor AQI was found for all species of wood and the majority of coals and mixed municipal waste. 
Extremely poor air quality was also observed for nearly all fractions of municipal waste, except for paper and 
cardboard packaging, whose combustion resulted in very poor air quality. Inhalation exposure to very poor air

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
quality can lead to health problems, such as disorders of the respiratory, cardiovascular and immune systems. 
Outdoor activities should be limited to the necessary minimum.
The American (US values, Table 4) and Chinese legislation (CN values) is slightly different from the legal 
solutions adopted in Europe, and thus in Poland (which is an EU Member State), in terms of measurement 
ranges. Of these, the EU regulations are the most restrictive. The good, fair and moderate AQI ranges are identical 
in the US and EU law, but significantly different in the CN legislation. In turn, the EU legislation is much more 
restrictive with regard to the poor, very poor and extremely poor AQI ranges as compared to the provisions in 
the US and CN (which are nearly identical), which is reflected in the final AQI assessment.
Air quality determined based on the CN criteria would be medium for 5 samples, poor for 13 samples, very 
poor for 13 samples and extremely poor for 1 sample (Table 4). According to the US criteria, AQI would be poor 
for 19 samples, very poor for 12 samples and extremely poor for 1 sample. As for the EU legislation (assigning 
the class according to the highest value of any parameter), AQI would be very poor for 4 samples and extremely 
poor for the other 28 samples.
The general conclusion stemming from this data is that all the solid fuels (hard coal), alternative fuels (coal 
pellets, pellets, wood) and municipal waste (mixed or selected fractions) analyzed in the study emit substantial 
amounts of PM2.5 and PM10 when combusted in household furnaces, which results in very poor or extremely 
poor air quality in the surrounding area. It should be stressed that the study had several limitations such as the 
existing climatic conditions, the terrain and the selected groups of materials (n = 32) subjected to combustion. 
Undoubtedly, the parameters of the furnace used in the study also significantly determined the study results.
Conclusion
In light of the research hypotheses, we found that:
•	 each type of fuel (AF, CF, AFw) combusted in a household furnace is a source of air pollutants, especially fine 
PM2.5 particles, which are harmful to human health,
•	 combustion of municipal waste in household furnaces is a substantial source of organic air pollutants (TVOC 
and HCHO) and thus constitutes a dangerous exposure source to people living in nearby areas,
•	 it is vital to stop burning such materials as polystyrene, rubber and upholstery foam in household furnaces 
due to the drastically high health risk associated with this practice,
•	 in rural areas, solid fuel combustion is a significant factor deteriorating the chemical condition of soils, espe­
cially those used for agricultural purposes.
•	 Furthermore, the study showed that research on this subject should be continued and extended to include 
detailed identification of individual particulate matter and VOC constituents, which would allow for calcu­
lating the overall health risk.
Despite the existing knowledge and legal regulations, the economic and political situation may prompt people to 
use waste for energy purposes. The data presented in the paper undoubtedly make an important contribution to 
the discussion on expanding and increasing the share of renewable sources in energy production in rural areas. 
The solution to the existing situation is to develop a model for managing renewable energy resources in such a 
way that individual energy sources are used most efficiently, with the least social cost and in accordance with the 
assumptions of sustainable development and environmental policies.

Association between sugar cane burning and
acute respiratory illness on the island of Maui
Christina Louise Mnatzaganian1*, Karen L. Pellegrin2, Jill Miyamura3, Diana Valencia4 and Lorrin Pang5
Abstract
Background: Sugar cane harvesting by burning on Maui island is an environmental health issue due to respiratory
effects of smoke. Volcanic smog (“vog”) from an active volcano on a neighboring island periodically blankets Maui
and could confound a study of cane smoke’s effects since cane burning is not allowed on vog days. This study
examines the association between cane burning and emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and
prescription fills for acute respiratory illnesses.
Methods: This retrospective study controlled for confounders that could increase respiratory distress on non-burn
days by matching each burn day with a non-burn day and then comparing the ratio of patients with respiratory
distress residing in the path of sugar burn smoke to those residing elsewhere on Maui on burn versus non-burn
days. Patients with acute respiratory distress were defined as those with one or more acute respiratory diagnoses at
one of the hospitals or emergency departments on Maui. Separately, patients with acute respiratory illness were
identified through prescription records from four community pharmacies, specifically defined as those who filled
prescriptions for acute respiratory distress.
Results: There were 1,256 reports of respiratory distress prescriptions and 686 hospital/ED diagnoses of acute
respiratory illness. The ratio of cases within to outside of smoke exposure was higher on burn days for both the
ED/hospital data and the pharmacy, though not statistically significant. In post-hoc analyses of the pharmacy data
based on the number of acres burned as a proxy for volume of smoke, there was a dose response trend for
acreage burned such that the highest quartile showed a statistically significant higher proportion of acute
respiratory distress in the exposed versus non-exposed regions (P = 0.015, OR 2.4, 95 % CI [1.2–4.8]).
Conclusions: After adjusting for confounders on non-burn days, there was a significantly higher incidence of
respiratory distress in smoke-exposed regions when greater amounts of acres were burned. Health officials should
consider actions to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with sugar cane burning practices.

Background
Outdoor air pollution is associated with mortality and
hospital admissions due to respiratory and cardiovascu-
lar disease in both short-term and long-term studies [1].
There is a paucity of research on the specific impact of
sugar cane burning on health, despite evidence that it is
at least as toxic as pollution produced by traffic and
more toxic than traffic after repeated exposures [2, 3]. In
particular, no published studies have examined the
impact of current sugar cane burning practices on the
island of Maui in Hawaii.
Sugar plantations were established two centuries ago
on the islands of Hawaii. Today, only the island of Maui
continues to produce 200,000 tons of cane annually [4].
Controlled, scheduled burns of cane fields occur prior to
harvest to reduce the volume of waste material for trans-
port and processing. Cane field fires produce smoke and
ash above the Maui central valley resulting in ash fall
locally known as “Maui snow”. Burns typically begin in
the early morning hours and end before dawn, thereby

Burning rules are set and monitored by the Hawaii
Department of Health (DOH). Burning is prohibited on
days when high amounts of volcanic smog (“vog”)
occur on Maui, originating from the consistently-active
Kilauea Volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii, located
117 miles southeast of Maui. There is a general north-
easterly wind direction during days when cane burning
is allowed. When vog blows in on weaker southerly
winds, it tends to uniformly expose Maui’s entire island
population. Therefore, vog could confound clinical/
epidemiologic studies of cane burning’s respiratory effects
if one used days of no cane burning as controls for days of
burning. Additionally, cane cannot be burned during
extremely rainy weather, which is associated with cold
symptoms, another potential confounder. Therefore, com-
parisons of burn versus non-burn days on Maui require
methods that control for at least these confounders.
The study of sugar cane burning on Maui is a particu-
larly important environmental health issue given the
relatively high prevalence of asthma in Hawaii. Accord-
ing to the National Center for Environmental Health,
asthma affects 16.9 % of children and 16.1 % of adults in
Hawaii, higher than the US prevalence of 12.5 % and
13.3 %, respectively [5, 6]. Asthma exacerbations have
continually contributed to increasing emergency de-
partment (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and mortality [7].
Hawaii reports approximately 5,000 ED visits and 1,500
hospital admissions annually due to asthma exacerba-
tions [8]. According to the National Institute of Health,
environmental factors that may trigger or exacerbate
acute respiratory illnesses include viral respiratory in-
fections, environmental allergens, smoking, exercise,
occupational chemicals, environmental changes, irri-
tants, emotions, stress, drugs, food, changes in weather,
exposure to cold air, and endocrine and comorbid con-
ditions [9]. Cane burning and vog emissions are typical
examples of smoke, chemical, and particulates on Maui.
Additionally, residents may be exposed to molds and
viral infections during extremely wet and rainy weather
when cane burning is not permitted.
There are only a few published studies to date that
examine the health effects of sugar cane burning and none
examining health effects under current DOH burning re-
strictions in the unique environment of Hawaii. Lehman
studied 36 patients who were scheduled for intracutaneous
skin testing due to significant chronic allergy problems.
When exposed to sugar cane smoke extract, there was a
significant increase (P < 0.01) in positive skin reactions in
subjects exposed to cane smoke extract as compared to
the control group [10]. In Louisiana, there were 6,498 hos-
pital visitations for asthma during a two-year study period
with a positive (though not significant) dose–response
trend in asthma hospitalization rates during sugar cane
burning [11].
Brazilian studies demonstrate an association with ad-
verse health effects. One study analyzed 673 records of
children less than thirteen years old and elderly greater
than 64 years old and found particulate matter (PM) and
carbon monoxide (CO) markers from cane burning led
to respiratory effects [12]. Data analysis showed that the
PM10 during the nonburning period was 28.9 ± 12.8 μg/m3
compared to 87.7 ± 57.9 μg/m3 during the burning
period. The PM2.5 during the nonburning period was
10.0 ± 4.6 μg/m3 compared to 22.8 ± 14.7 μg/m3 during
the burning period. In both the child and elderly group,
PM10, PM2.5, and black carbon were significantly asso-
ciated with respiratory hospital admissions even after
adjusting for season and weather. These correlations
remained significant even after adjusting for season
and weather.
In another ecological time-series study, total sus-
pended particle (TSP) concentrations from cane burning
doubled during burn periods with a statistically signifi-
cant increase in asthma hospital admissions 1–5 days
after increasing TSP concentrations [13]. Study authors
used a lag structure of 0 to 9 days between burn dates
and hospital admissions with adjustments for over-
dispersion. During the 493 days of the study, there were
a total of 640 asthma hospital admissions; during the
burning period (318 days) there were 477 admissions, a
rate 50 % higher, and statistically significant, compared
to
163
admissions
during
the
non-burning
period
(175 days).
In a descriptive, cross-sectional study of 1,076 private-
and public-schooled children aged 10–14, Riguera found
lower asthma symptoms but higher rates of rhinitis in
children during times of burning [14]. Through a series
of assessments, he found that the prevalence of asthma
and rhinitis symptoms was 11 % and 33.2 %, respect-
ively. Rhinitis occurred most frequently from June to
October, a period that matches the sugar cane harvest
season in Brazil as well as seasonal variations. Addition-
ally, daily prevalence of peak expiratory flow below 20 %
of the median of each child’s best measurements was
greater in days with higher PM2.5 concentrations. The
authors concluded that the prevalence of asthma symp-
toms was actually below the national Brazilian average
(19 %) whereas rhinitis prevalence exceeded the national
average (29.6 %) during the study period.
More recently, there is evidence that reduction of pre-
harvest sugar cane burning in response to a state law in
Brazil requiring the gradual elimination of this practice
has been associated with a decrease in hospitalizations
due to respiratory disease [15].

Agency (EPA) studied cane and leaf burning from Hawaii

crops in an incinerating tower for pollutant analysis [16].
Burning of 20 whole cane plots and 19 cane leaf trash
samples
yielded
particulates,
carbon
monoxide,
and
hydrocarbon emissions all within normal ranges of many
other herbaceous types of fuel previously burned within
the tower. During whole cane burns, particulate yields
averaged 112 lbs/acre of fuel burned (99 % CI with true
mean between 92 and 132 lbs/acre), which was deter-
mined to not be excessive. The carbon monoxide yield
averaged 1,113 lbs/acre (99 % CI with true mean between
843 and 1,383 lbs/acre), and also determined to be a
moderate amount emitted, similar to the yield from dry
cereal grain straw. Finally, the hydrocarbon yield averaged
152 lbs/acre (99 % CI with true mean of 121 lbs/acre) and
authors concluded this also to be within normal emis-
sions. Pollutant yields from leaf trash were a little less than
from whole cane; additionally, those fires simulated
against the direction of wind flow did not emit any signifi-
cant difference compared those in the direction of wind
flow. However, this marker study does not address all pol-
lutants potentially causing health problems or examine if
mixtures of pollutants have a compounding effect. For
example, vog is another source of air pollution on Maui
and was studied at a clinic downwind from the active vol-
cano on the Big Island of Hawaii [17]. In sampling 1,189
patients, high vog exposure during increased volcanic ac-
tivity was associated with a six-fold increase in health
visits for acute airway problems, cough, headache, and
pharyngitis.
Given the link between sugar cane burning and nega-
tive respiratory health outcomes in other locations, the
high prevalence of asthma in Hawaii, and the complex
environment in Hawaii, it is important to study the im-
pact of current sugar burning practices on Maui. There-
fore, this study retrospectively examines the relationship
between sugar cane
burning and acute respiratory
illnesses on the island of Maui on burn days while con-
trolling for confounding factors likely to be present on
non-burn days.
Methods
Study design
This study used a historical, controlled (paired), and par-
tially blinded design to compare the ratio of respiratory
distress events among those residing in the path of sugar
cane burn smoke to those residing elsewhere on Maui
on burn versus non-burn days. This design controls for
confounding variables (e.g., vog and rain) on the non-
burn days. The ratio of cases from smoke exposure area
to non-exposed areas was hypothesized to be higher on
burn days compared to non-burn days. The Institutional
Review Boards of the University of Hawaii and the Hawaii
DOH granted ethical approval.
Data sources
Cane burning records between April 2011-April 2012
were obtained from the DOH. This period was selected
because cane employees used a newer, detailed system of
reporting information with spot-check confirmation by
DOH personnel. Investigators selected 55 burn days
where burning was completed by 6:00 AM (to ensure
residential exposures only), more than 70 acres were
burned, and uniform wind speed greater than zero. Each
burn day was matched with a random non-burn day that
was preceded by at least four days of no burning as a
“washout” period.
DOH field maps and Google Earth software were then
utilized to identify areas where burning occurred. The
sugar cane company maps and numbers all cane fields
so the burn location and acreage is available in records
submitted to the DOH. Investigators plotted the site of
the burn and drew a cone of smoke exposure based on
the averaged wind directions with a 30 degree angle of
smoke dispersion. This angle was determined from ob-
servations of smoke from the sugar mill during a variety
of wind conditions as well as previously conducted re-
search [18]. Areas of exposure were drawn to the edge
of the island.
Respiratory distress events on selected burn and non-
burn dates were obtained from two sources: a database
of all hospital admissions and all ED visits on Maui and
four community pharmacies on Maui. Hospital admis-
sion and ED data pertaining to acute respiratory disease
were obtained from Hawaii Health Information Corpor-
ation (HHIC). HHIC collects, cleans, and verifies de-
tailed patient-level discharge data from hospitals for all
payers in the state of Hawaii. HHIC data elements in-
clude patient race/ethnicity, age, gender, insurer, length
of stay, patient residence, and primary and secondary
International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision
(ICD-9) diagnostic codes. Specifically, the following dis-
charges and ED visits were obtained from HHIC on
selected burn and non-burn days: asthma with exacer-
bation (ICD-9 493.02), acute bronchitis (ICD-9 466.0),
acute sinusitis (ICD-9 461), acute pharyngitis including
streptococcal pharyngitis (ICD-9 462; 034.0), acute con-
junctivitis (ICD-9 372.0), cough (ICD-9 786.2), head-
ache (ICD-9 339), all pneumonias (ICD-9 480–486),
and other acute airway problems (requiring immediate
treatment such as oxygen, medications, or respiratory
treatments, ICD-9 786.05).
Databases of prescriptions filled from four commu-
nity pharmacies in four different regions (representing
13 % of the pharmacies on Maui) were queried for the
following medications used to treat respiratory condi-
tions: albuterol, ipratropium, and albuterol/ipratropium
inhalers and nebulizers, nasal sprays including flu-
ticasone, mometasone, and flunisolide, promethazine/

(100

and
200 mg), prednisone tablets (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg),
methylprednisolone dose-packs, and medications for
conjunctivitis including prednisolone, olopatadine, and
prednisolone eye drops.
For each respiratory distress event (i.e., hospital admis-
sion, ED visit, prescription filled), the patient’s home ad-
dress was obtained. Patients with residences outside of
Maui were excluded, and those with multiple qualifying
diagnoses or prescriptions were counted as one exposure.
For each burn day and matched non-burn day, sub-
jects with one or more respiratory distress events were
plotted to reside either in the area of cane smoke ex-
posure or outside of it. To facilitate understanding of
the design, subjects from both burn days and non-burn
days were plotted on the same map (Fig. 1). Data were
tallied across all pairs of days retaining the exposed vs.
non-exposed and burn day vs. non-burn day designa-
tions. A 2x2 Chi-square test was used to compare these
mutually exclusive counts, aggregated across all burn/
non-burn day pairs. An equivalent approach would be
to take the odds ratio (OR) of these two ratios with a
null hypothesis of no effect having this OR (burn day
ratio: non-burn day ratio) = 1.

Results
There were 191 burn days from April 2011-April 2012; 55
burn days and 55 matching non-burn days were chosen
based on the criteria previously detailed (Table 1).
Hospital data
Island-wide, there were 315 hospital/ED acute respira-
tory visits on burn days and 371 hospital/ED visits on
non-burn days (N = 686); without any mapping to smoke
exposure versus no exposure there was a significantly
higher (P = 0.04) rate of respiratory illnesses on the days
when cane was not burned (Table 1). However, in the
analyses of exposed vs. non-exposed smoke areas to con-
trol for the confounders on non-burn days, 37 (11.7 %)
of the 315 cases on burn days were exposed compared
to 34 (9.2 %) of the 371 cases from the corresponding
areas during non-burn days (Table 2). This higher pro-
portion of respiratory distress from exposed areas on
burn days was not significant (P = 0.33; RR = 1.28, 95 %
CI [0.82–2.0]).
Pharmacy data
Similar results were found with the pharmacy data.
Island-wide, there were 576 patients who filled respiratory
prescriptions on burn days and 680 subjects who filled
prescriptions on non-burn days (N = 1,256); without map-
ping to smoke exposure areas there was a significantly
higher number during non-burn days (P = 0.0025; RR
1.18, 95 % CI [1.06–1.31]) (Table 1). However, in smoke
exposure mapping analyses of exposed vs. non-exposed
areas to control for confounders on non-burn days, 76
(13.2 %) of the 576 cases on burn days were exposed com-
pared to 78 (11.5 %) of the 680 cases in the corresponding
areas during the non-burn days (Table 2). This greater
proportion of respiratory distress in the area of exposure
on burn days was not statistically significant.
Thus, the hypothesis that the ratio of respiratory dis-
tress events among those inside to outside smoke ex-
posure areas would be greater on burn day than on
non-burn days was not supported with either hospital
data or pharmacy data. To explore the possibility of dose
response in post-hoc analyses, the selected burn days (and
paired non-burn days) were broken down by quartiles ac-
cording to the acreage burned; in essence, into four
smaller studies using data from the community phar-
macies. There was a statistically significant (P = 0.02;
OR = 2.4 (95 % CI [1.2–4.8]) higher proportion of
illness from the smoke exposed areas during the highest
quartile of cane burning based on number of acres
burned. The remaining quartiles did not show statisti-
cally significant differences although the OR trended
downwards as the amount of cane burned decreased by
acreage (1.07, 0.86, 0.74, respectively) (Table 3).
To estimate study power and sample size, with 177
total exposures from each of the burn and non-burn
days one could have detected a shift in cases from 15 to
11 % of total cases in the exposed areas between the
burn and non-burn days, respectively (alpha error of 5 %
and beta of 20 %). With 750 in each group one had the
same power to detect a smaller 15 % to 13 % shift.
Statistical calculations were done using EPIINFO 7.0; if
not specified otherwise, P-values were calculated by
Fishers Exact tests.
Discussion
The use of global positioning system (GPS) mapping
allowed study investigators to compare the ratio of cases
of cane-smoke exposed regions during burning to the
ratio of cases from these same areas when no burning
occurred to isolate the effect of burning. Comparison of
these two ratios adjusted for vog, as well as other
geographical or temporal confounding effects. Without
these adjustments we showed there was significantly
more symptoms on the days when cane was not burned,
which would be expected due to respiratory effects of
vog and the prohibition of burning cane on vog days.

With these adjustments there was an increase, although
statistically insignificant, in the proportion of cases from
smoke-exposed areas during days of cane burning. When
this same analysis was repeated by quartiles of acreage of
cane burned as a “dose” effect, there was a trend showing
higher proportions from the smoke-exposed areas when
more cane was burned. The highest quartile showed a sta-
tistically significant higher proportion corresponding to
2.4 fold increase in the expected number of cases and a
dose–response effect by quantity of acreage burned.
When studying the health impact of cane burning, the
typical design would tally all acute symptoms associated
with a burn event and compare to control periods with
no cane smoke exposure. It is typically assumed that
most or all of the acute symptoms caused by cane burning
occur temporally near the burn event. When symptoms
(or the measurable events reflecting the symptoms) might
lag the burn event by a few days, designs must account for
this potential lag to ensure that the control period isn’t
“contaminated” with lagged effects from the burn event.
In this study, control periods were chosen to account for
this potential lag in symptoms by selecting non-burn days
that were preceded by at least four days of no burning.
Similarly, designs that limit measurement of acute symp-
toms to the day of the burn event risk missing lagged
symptoms that are caused by the event. While this ap-
proach was used in this study and represents a limitation,
measuring symptoms in the first 24 h after exposure was
believed to be the best way to capture most of those
caused by the burn event while minimizing the inclusion
of symptoms due to other causes.
A unique challenge to designing research on the health
impact of cane burning on Maui is that burning is
intentionally avoided on “voggy” days. Thus, simply
comparing acute symptoms across the Maui population
on burn versus non-burn days does not isolate the im-
pact of cane burning. That is, the higher vog pollution
on non-burn days potentially masks the impact of cane
burning. Therefore, the design must adjust for vog and
other
potential
confounding
factors.
One
approach
would be to select the control, no-burn days, to have
exactly the same vog effect as the burn days. This is
problematic as the declaration of a “vog day” is very sub-
ject and imprecise, depending on observing haze and the
amount and duration of the haze seen. For a given year,
different agencies report varying percentages of vog days
between 5–20 % for Maui. Additionally, associations
with marker chemical pollutant(s) are not well validated.
Therefore, the method used in this study (ratio of ratios)
is more likely to effectively control for confounders that
potentially affect health island-wide by comparing the
ratio of symptoms in exposed versus non-exposed re-
gions on burn versus non-burn days.
Furthermore, it may appear that the lower two quar-
tiles of acreage burned have a “protective effect” where
areas of smoke exposure have proportionately fewer
cases when looking at the trend effect based on acreage.
It is possible that there is an underrepresentation of out-
comes in all quartiles. Perhaps the methods of measur-
ing respiratory distress only captured more acute events,
so that the impact of burning on indicators of milder re-
spiratory distress (e.g., clinic visits, taking a sick day
from work, and/or general malaise) were not measured.
For example, when the smoke exposure is mild (lower
quartiles), respiratory distress symptoms may be milder,
and subjects take a “wait and see” approach hoping that
the symptoms clear with the smoke. This could result in
lower than normal ED visits, hospital admissions, or pre-
scription fills that day. The following day, the symptoms
either clear or result in case outcomes if they don’t re-
solve; thus a lag-effect may exist. Our method only de-
tected symptoms on the day of the burning and would
miss second-day delayed visits and/or more mild distress
if they occurred.
While we controlled for the effect of vog and rain more
likely to occur on non-burn days, our study design can
address other confounders like “healthy survivor” effect
where residents relocate to another part of the island to
avoid the vog as well as disproportionate pharmacy cover-
age across a geographical area. The strength of the meth-
odology is that the adjustments occur without actually
knowing the degree of confounding or even identifying
that a confounder exists. This is analogous to having an
individual be his own control, which adjusts for known
and unknown confounders, measured or not. For small

communities requiring a rapid assessment of outdoor pol-
lution sources, this method should be considered. This
method requires that the targeted confounding effect oc-
curs either uniformly geographically (vog, pollen, or mold)
or persists over time (pharmacy coverage, healthy survivor
effect, etc.). An alternative approach to adjusting for con-
founders may involve mathematical modeling (regres-
sions, etc.). In order to do this, one must measure the
confounding effect upon which to build the model. For ef-
fects like vog, this may be difficult since there are a variety
of irritants, acting alone and in combinations, and clinical
effects may persist beyond the actual detection period
of the polluting chemicals in the air. However, our
design of comparing morbidity of self-matched groups
offers a simple way to adjust for confounders without
actually knowing the markers or the magnitude of their
effects. Perhaps a stratified analysis on the matched
case–control pairs would have offered more precision
but it is not clear how much more these statistical
methods would have added [19].
Given the accumulation of data showing the negative
health impact from air pollution in general and sugar
cane burning specifically, public health officials should
consider actions to minimize this impact. This study
suggests that limiting the number of acres burned on a
given day might significantly reduce acute respiratory
distress among those residing in exposed areas. It is
noteworthy that in Brazil, where most of the studies of
sugar cane burning impact have been conducted, one
state has passed a law requiring the gradual elimination
of pre-harvest burning. Preliminary results indicate that
this has resulted in improvements in respiratory health
[15]. While economic interests are often of concern with
such actions, economic evaluations should include all
likely impacts, including cost of associated healthcare,
productivity, and quality of life. On Maui, where tourism
is the dominant economic engine, impact on visitors
should also be considered.
Conclusions
These results provide additional evidence of the harmful
effects of sugar cane burning on respiratory functioning,
specifically a “dose” response based on the number of
acres burned as an indicator of volume of smoke. Maui
is a small island with a complex environment that
includes vog and other potential triggers of respiratory
distress. New technologies may offer better detection of
chemical markers of pollution; however, this study dem-
onstrated that modern technology of satellite mapping
can help control for confounders. While additional
research will advance scientific understanding of the
relationship between air pollution and health, public
health officials should consider taking action based on
the accumulation of research to date.

Abstract
Background: Since July 2015, Lebanon has been experiencing a waste management crisis. Dumpsites in inhabited
areas and waste burning have emerged due to the waste accumulation, further adding to the gravity of the situation.
However, the association between the crisis and health of the population has not been scientifically reported.
Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted to assess whether exposure to open dumpsites and
waste burning is associated with acute health symptoms. The study sample included 221 male workers between the
ages of 18–60 years selected from two areas chosen based on their proximity to a garbage dumpsite and waste
burning. 110 workers were exposed to a garbage dumpsite and waste burning, and 111 workers were not. Data
were collected via a face-to-face interview using a newly developed validated structured questionnaire. Chi-square
tests were used to check for statistically significant differences between exposure and covariates. Multivariable analyses
using multiple logistic regression were used to compare health symptoms between exposed and unexposed workers
adjusting for potential confounders.
Results: The prevalence of acute health symptoms was greater among the exposed workers than the non-exposed
workers, including gastrointestinal, respiratory, dermatological and constitutional symptoms. Controlling for
confounding variables, such as age, insurance, family support, residence near dumpsite, work site, and smoking, a
minimum odds ratio (OR) of 4.30 was obtained when comparing the exposed population to those non-exposed.
Conclusion: The strong association between improper waste management and physical health calls for immediate
attention by the government, stakeholders and community members to find optimal solutions for this waste
management crisis and set immediate priority interventions such as regular waste collection, volume reduction and
recycling performance improvement. However, the long recall period may have underestimated our results.

Background
From July 17, 2015 till end of September, heaps of garbage
crowded the residential areas and streets in Lebanon.
Civic protests broke out throughout the country calling
for a clean-up of the streets and asking for a permanent
solution to the waste management dilemma the country
has been facing for years [1]. Temporary solutions were
made, eventually resulting in the reemergence of the crisis
in August 2016. Due to the lack of a proper national re-
cycling plan, waste management remains as one of the
most challenging development-related issues that the
government is facing. Historically, municipalities have
managed disposal and refuse collection. As a conse-
quence of civil unrest, municipalities have been unable
to provide a much needed service and until recently
slow burning and uncontrolled dumping on hillsides
and seashores, particularly in industrial areas such as
Dawra and Dekwaneh, have become common practices

for solid waste disposal in Lebanon resulting in serious
land, sea and air pollution problems [2].
The change in weather conditions and prolonged
duration of the crisis reached a critical stage, resulting
in multiple claims regarding health implications and
infectious illnesses, including accumulation and leakage of
toxins into water sources and spreading of pathogens in-
cluding, but not limited to, Vibrio cholerae and hepatitis
[3]. While leakage into water sources can be compensated
by a high-quality water system, this leakage, however,
could be concerning given the inefficient water system in
Lebanon. Municipal water supplied to households in
Lebanon was reported to be turbid, possibly because of
infrequent monitoring of the municipal water quality [4].
Improper
disposal
of
garbage,
specifically
burning
wastes in the open, poses serious danger on health. Some
of the most dangerous pollutants emitted are dioxins, par-
ticle pollution, carbon monoxide and volatile organic
compounds. Dioxins are persistent, bio-accumulative and
toxic pollutants that settle on plants, thus building up in
the food chain and resulting in harmful effects. Some of
the adverse effects of dioxins include suppression of im-
mune systems, disruption on hormonal system and cancer
[5–7]. Particle pollutants are microscopic particles that
can aggravate respiratory conditions such as asthma and
bronchitis and are associated with cardiac arrhythmias
and heart attacks. Carbon monoxide can cause neurologic
symptoms in people exposed to significant burning of gar-
bage; these symptoms include headache, fatigue, nausea
and vomiting. Inhaling volatile organic compounds can
cause headaches, loss of coordination, nausea, damage to
the liver, kidney and central nervous system and irritation
to the eye, nose and throat. Hence, the broad spectrum of
adverse effects caused by emission of these compounds
into the atmosphere calls for serious restructuring of
waste management in Lebanon [8].
Current research indicates that burning wastes can
increase the risk of heart disease, aggravate respiratory
ailments such as asthma and emphysema and cause
rashes, nausea, headaches or diarrhea, damages in the
nervous system, kidney or liver, in the reproductive system
and development system [9, 10]. For instance, burning of
polystyrene polymers, such as foam cups or meat trays,
releases styrene gas that is absorbed through the skin
and lungs, resulting in harmful effects ranging from a
spectrum of acute symptoms to severe life-changing
problems [5]. Moreover, the acid and chemicals emitted
by trash fires can cause severe bronchoconstriction in
asthmatics [11]. Other long-term effects caused by ex-
posure to a landfill include congenital abnormalities
and malformations [12].
In Lebanon, waste accumulation on the streets and
other sites has led to the emergence of unlicensed landfills
and dumpsites in inhabited areas [3]. Improper waste
management is a public health concern with a large
spectrum of outcomes. However, data concerning the
magnitude of the ongoing waste crisis, such as the preva-
lence of acute health symptoms resulting from improper
waste management, is still scarce and has not been scien-
tifically reported. This study aimed to assess whether ex-
posure to dump sites and waste burning is associated with
poor physical health, defined by the occurrence of acute
health symptoms. Acute symptoms have a rapid onset and
a short course. It includes, but is not limited to, general
systemic symptoms such as nausea, skin allergies, dyspnea
– shortness of breath – and asthma attacks.
Methods
Research design
A comparative cross-sectional study of 221 male workers
aged 18–60 years was conducted in the northern suburbs
of the capital city.
A total of 110 participants was taken from workplaces
in Dawra, a region in the Northern suburbs of the capital
Beirut, characterized by patriarchal industrial areas, and in
proximity (100 m radius) of a major open dump, where
the waste burning also occurred. A comparison group of
111 workers was taken from Dekwaneh, another industrial
area in the suburbs of Beirut, close to Dawra and where
no garbage dump existed within a 100 m radius. Workers
who have been working in the chosen industrial areas of
similar composition for at least 3 months were inter-
viewed. Foreign workers, mentally handicapped and phys-
ically disabled workers were excluded to minimize any
communication problems.
A walk-through survey method was adopted to select
a random sample of workers in each of the two areas.
All consecutive shops (mechanic, electrician, retail of
auto spare parts, companies such as BOSCH) in the
blocks were selected. Upon consent of the employer to
approach his/her employees, the investigators inquired
from the employees whose birthdays were closest to the
date of interview and selected him. The research team
member(s) filled out the structured questionnaire ac-
cordingly on behalf of the selected employees.
Measures
We defined acute symptoms as those that have a rapid
onset and a short course; the outcomes encompassed
22 physical symptoms from major systems, including
non-specific constitutional symptoms. These systems
included the gastrointestinal systems, integumentary
system/skin, and upper respiratory system. Other con-
stitutional symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, and
headache were noted as well.
Indicators for the acute symptoms included the pres-
ence of the symptoms based on a recall period of 2
Morsi et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:39

months prior to the interview, duration, severity, treat-
ment, and absence from work (in days).
Other co-variates included the socioeconomic charac-
teristics of workers (age, educational level, marital status,
occupation, income sufficiency, and health insurance
status); exposure related variables such as working site
(indoors or outdoors), residency area (whether there is a
garbage dump present in the vicinity of their residence)
and the use of protective measures (eg. mask, etc.); health-
related variables including presence of chronic conditions
such as diabetes, asthma, cancer, and smoking status.
Data collection
After gaining consent from the Institutional Review
Board (IRB) at the American University of Beirut, data
were collected from the participants through a struc-
tured questionnaire. The employer was first approached
to take permission for interviewing the workers. Upon
his approval, the workers were then randomly selected
based on the last-birthday sampling method, where the
available employees were called upon by the employer
and were asked for their birthdays. If the employer re-
fused to give consent, then no replacement of the shop
was made. The employees with the birthdays closest to
the date of interview at the time being were selected for
the study, and the research team member(s) asked for
the employees’ verbal consent. Upon consenting, the re-
search team member(s) proceeded with surveying each
worker in a more private place in the shop or office,
avoiding any third person not directly involved with the
face-to-face interview or research team.
Data analysis
We analyzed the quantitative data using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v.23. The survey re-
sults were summarized and presented as the percentage
of participants who had a response to each statement.
Frequency distributions and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were calculated to estimate relevant prevalence
rates of acute symptoms.
All co-variates were cross-tabulated with exposure status
and Chi-square tests performed to check for statistically
significant differences. The presence of acute symptoms
was compared according to exposure status. Unadjusted
ORs and their 95% confidence intervals were reported.
The symptoms chosen for multivariable analysis were
based on the number of outcomes per symptom and their
significance. The adjusted ORs for each symptom were
then calculated using multiple logistic regression including
the confounding variables found to significantly affect the
data at the bivariate level. Finally, bivariate analysis was
conducted to compare the distribution of acute conditions
between the exposed sample and the non-exposed sample.
Non-parametric tests such as Mann–Whitney U test were
then used to confirm whether there was an association
between exposure to waste and the distribution of
symptoms. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Table 1 presents the characteristics of the participants by
exposure status. The two groups were similar with respect
to age, education, marital status, work shift duration, and
income sufficiency. Exposed workers were more likely
than non-exposed to be living near a dumpsite (42.7% vs
22.7%), and to work indoors (48.2% vs. 26.1) and to be the
main support to their family (81.0% vs. 65.5%).
With regard to the health-related demographic charac-
teristics, the majority of both non-exposed and exposed
workers did not have a chronic disease, such as diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, etc. A significantly higher pro-
portion of exposed workers were smokers (61.8% vs.
45.9%). The majority of both non-exposed and exposed
workers had insurance.
Prevalence of acute physical symptoms with exposure to
waste
Multivariable analysis was used to control for the poten-
tial confounders that were found to be significant with
exposure and outcomes at the bivariate level. These con-
founders included residence near a dumpsite, place of
work (indoors, outdoors, or both), family support and
smoking status. Age and insurance were also controlled
for, to minimize any effect on their association with the
workers’ physical health.
Table 2 shows the results of different logistic regression
models for the association between each acute physical
symptom and exposure to waste, after adjusting for con-
founders. Workers exposed to waste burning and dump
sites have significantly greater odds of having fatigue
(OR = 22.48; 95% CI 9.34–54.09), headache (OR = 16.88;
95% CI 7.85–36.31), and insomnia (OR = 10.64; 95% CI
3.09–36.67) among general constitutive symptoms. Exposed
workers also have greater odds of gastrointestinal manifes-
tations, including nausea (OR = 9.72; 95% CI 4.74–19.92),
diarrhea (OR = 4.30; 95% CI 1.65–11.18), and vomiting
(OR = 4.74; 95% CI 1.53–14.68). Being exposed was also
significantly associated with respiratory symptoms, includ-
ing dyspnea (OR = 14.99; 95% CI 6.60–34.01), sneezing
(OR = 24.75; 95% CI 8.41–72.80), dry cough (OR = 9.57;
95% CI 4.03–22.70), sputum (OR = 8.79; 95% CI 3.23–
23.94), and rhinorrhea (OR = 6.00; 95% CI 2.48–14.56).
Moreover, the median number of symptoms for exposed
workers was greater than that of non-exposed workers
(1 vs. 4). An independent-samples Mann–Whitney U test
showed that there was a statistically significant difference
between the underlying distributions of symptoms in ex-
posed workers as opposed to non-exposed workers.

Severity of acute physical symptoms among both exposed
and non-exposed workers
Nausea, headache and diarrhea were chosen to estimate
the severity of the symptoms among the exposure group,
out of all the symptoms found to be significant and with
prevalence greater than 10%. Around half of those ex-
posed reporting headaches took medication (45.1%),
while around 80% of those not exposed reporting head-
aches took medication. Those exposed who reported
nausea had leaves of absence ranging from zero to
30 days, while those not exposed who reported nausea
did not take any leaves of absence. Additionally, around
a quarter of exposed workers who reported diarrhea
visited doctors; around one-tenth of these individuals
took leaves of absence. On the other hand, around five
percent of those non-exposed who reported diarrhea
visited doctors, and none of these individuals took any
leave of absence.
Discussion
The results from this comparative cross-sectional study
showed that exposure to open waste dump is associated
with a greater likelihood of acute symptoms. These
results are consistent with the claims mentioned on the
health implications that the improper waste manage-
ment could result in, such as an increased risk of asthma
and increased rate of hospitalization due to respiratory
and gastrointestinal manifestations [3].
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been
conducted on the association between garbage exposure
and physical health of workers during the waste crisis
that extended from July till end of September 2015.
Most of the claims were not based on scientific evidence.
Moreover, it is the first study documenting and analyzing
the type of symptoms occurring as well as the severity.
These findings reinforce the negative implications of im-
proper waste management as suggested by other findings
in regards to exposure to carcinogenic air toxins such as
dioxins linked to diseases like lymphomas, leukemias, and
heart disease [13].
This is a rigorous epidemiological study controlling
for many potential confounders. One potential variable
that was not taken into account is the installment and
usage of ventilation systems. We also minimized recall
bias by coinciding data collection with the waste crisis.
However, a two-month recall period may have underes-
timated the prevalence and duration of reported symp-
toms or may have affected the reported data related to
medication. Other strengths included selecting a sam-
ple of adequate representation of the working popula-
tion, and increasing the external validity of the study by
randomly selecting the workers. The working population
chosen was representative of the working Lebanese popu-
lation, given the age and gender of the sample selected.
The socio-demographic characteristics were generally
similar to that of the Lebanese population in regards to
age groups,
smoking, education, marital status and
chronic medical conditions [14].

The confidence in the association between garbage
exposure and physical health of workers was affected by
a number of limitations. One limitation was that docu-
menting symptoms was self-reported and based on recall
and not on any objective medical assessment. In addition,
the target population did not include vulnerable age
groups such as children and the elderly, but rather only
included those workers, who were present at the time of
data collection. Moreover, workers who were severely
affected by the crisis may have not been present at the
time of data collection.
Policy implications
Therefore, our study establishes an association of large
magnitude
between
garbage
exposure
and
physical
health. The burden of garbage exposure on physical
health is not the only alarming issue; the garbage exposure
may also have financial implications, which pose as an
economic burden on the Lebanese population. Workers
may have also transmitted the infections to other house-
hold members, and this may be considered a social bur-
den. Hence, this study stresses the importance of taking
strict measures to alleviate any anticipated consequences
of the waste management crisis. Although waste manage-
ment plans are being currently discussed, they are still not
optimal to alleviate the symptoms entirely. Instead, they
might be resulting in shifting the symptoms elsewhere.
Short-term measures to be considered include indus-
trial waste minimization by adopting measures such as
production process modification, volume reduction and
recovery. Each municipality can create well-planned
landfills or incineration sites located more than 10 km
away from inhabited areas, attempt to prevent trash piles
from contaminating water sources, routinely measure
contaminated
water
sources
for
toxins,
implement
awareness campaigns on recycling and health hazards, and
collaborate with the government and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to achieve better outcomes [3]. It is
important to set immediate priority interventions such as
regular waste collection, volume reduction and improve-
ment in recycling performance. On an individual level,
citizens should also be more aware of protective mea-
sures such as recycling, minimizing individual acts of
waste burning, and wearing masks, in order to minimize
the transmission of pathogens.
Long-term measures include establishing a proper
color-coding system for waste segregation, collection,
transportation, storage and providing proper training for
waste handlers; import and export regulatory regimes
should also be established on a policy level as forms of
interventions;
a
regulatory
framework
and
national
guidelines should be established under which regional and
national treatment/disposal polices are to be developed;

non-governmental organization is the Integrated Sus-
tainable Waste Management (ISWM). This waste man-
agement plan would optimally include a cohesive tie in
the environmental sustainability, economic costs and so-
cial acceptance of all potential solutions for the current
waste crisis in Beirut [15, 16]. Another multifaceted meas-
ure would be the initiation of a national committee in
Lebanon for the monitoring and surveillance of proper
disposal and garbage treatment practices. The government
can also participate by appointing local municipalities with
waste management responsibilities, and provide these
municipalities with technical and financial support [3].
Lebanon recently finalized the municipalities that poten-
tially need to systematically address this waste manage-
ment problem in an evidence-based manner. However,
our results are timely and critical for these new leaders to
urgently take on a more active role. Despite the fact that
there might not be an optimal solution for waste disposal,
efforts should be directed towards involving all stake-
holders in formulating local models and building on the
strengths of the city [17].
Conclusion
It has been established that improper waste management
can have an impact on the physical health in the short
run. However, if this waste crisis is not contained and
managed immediately, it might have other long-term
health implications. Therefore, it is important to take
necessary measures and implement policies to maintain
the situation, to avoid emergence of epidemics and attend
to these health consequences before they occur.

The open burning of plastic wastes is a practice that is highly prevalent across the globe, toxic to human and 
environmental health, and a critical—but often overlooked—aspect of plastic pollution. Most of the countries 
where such burning is widespread have laws and policies in place against it; open burning continues never­
theless. In this article, using data from ethnographic fieldwork in urban and rural sites in India, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, and Zambia, we examine local practices of open burning and investigate why regulations to tackle it 
have proven largely ineffective. Adopting a harm reduction approach, we then suggest preliminary measures to 
mitigate the health risks of open burning by targeting those plastics and packaging types that are most toxic 
when burned.   
1. Introduction 
In 2019, an article in the New York Times led with the headline, “To 
Make this Tofu, Start by Burning Toxic Plastic” (Paddock 2019b). Based 
on data from an environmental report, it described the use of waste 
plastics as fuel for tofu businesses in Tropodo, Indonesia. The article 
quickly captured international attention. Plastic scrap is plentiful in 
Tropodo because it is shipped there, much of it from the USA, ostensibly 
for recycling. Small-scale tofu makers within Tropodo burn low-grade 
plastic waste as fuel to create the steam that turns soybean milk into 
tofu. They then donate the ashes to farmers to be used as fertilizer. 
Studies have documented alarming levels of toxicants, such as dioxins 
and polychlorinated biphenyls, in the soil and in the eggs of free-range 
chickens in the area (Petrlik et al., 2019). 
A month after that article, a follow-up detailed how the Indonesian 
government was tacitly allowing the practice to continue: “Rather than 
enforce a ban on the burning of waste plastic, much of which came until 
recently from the United States, the Ministry of Environment and 
Forestry appointed a panel of Indonesian experts to counter the report 
released last month by Indonesian and international environmental 
groups” (Paddock 2019a). As this article notes, Indonesia has existing 
laws against the open burning of plastic wastes. Why, then, were they 
still being thus burned? And why was the focus on the burning of plastic 
wastes in Indonesia rather than on the export of those wastes from the 
USA? Neither of these two aspects—the open burning of plastic wastes, 
predominantly in the Global South, and the shaming of populations 
there for what is, in fact, a global plastic waste crisis—is novel to this 
case. 
The open burning of plastic wastes—which we define as the burning 
of waste plastics in open fires without managing for the emission of 
byproducts, such as gases and ash, into the ambient air or soili—is 
widespread across the globe. It occurs even in the Global Northii but is 
especially prevalent among low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in 
the Global South. Estimates of the scale of open burning among LMICs

range from around 40 % to 65 % of total municipal solid waste (Chris­
tian et al., 2010; Velis and Cook 2021; Wiedinmyer, Yokelson, and 
Gullett 2014). Plastic waste is growing exponentially alongside plastic 
production, and plastics form a significant and ever-growing proportion 
of burned trash. 
A significant source of air pollution, the open burning of mixed 
wastes produces a variety of adverse environmental and human health 
effects. Plastics are a particularly problematic waste stream when it 
comes to open burning; a study attributed 90 % of black carbon emitted 
from burning wastes to polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, two 
types of plastics (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). The open burning of 
plastics is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, respiratory 
issues, neurological disorders, nausea, skin rashes, numbness or tingling 
in the fingers, headaches, memory loss, and confusion (Adetona et al., 
2020; Azoulay et al., 2019; Irianti and Prasetyoputra 2018; Kov´ats et al., 
2022; Velis and Cook 2021; Verma et al., 2016; Wiedinmyer, Yokelson, 
and Gullett 2014). Some toxic emissions, such as polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons, have been linked to cancer and birth defects (Balcom, 
Cabrera, and Carey 2021). Ash from open burning contaminates the soil 
and enters groundwater and the food chain. Plastic packaging, which 
accounts for approximately 40 % of global plastics produced, frequently 
contains additives “such as fillers, plasticizers, flame retardants, color­
ants, stabilizers, lubricants, foaming agents, and antistatic agents” in 
addition to adhesives and coatings (Groh et al., 2019: 3255). Additives 
containing metals, including cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, co­
balt, tin, and zinc, are particularly dangerous (Groh et al., 2019: 3264). 
When we think of plastic pollution—which has come to global 
prominence as an urgent environmental challenge—we rarely think of 
the open burning of plastics. The focus, within the media and public 
discourses, tends to be on marine plastics, plastic litter, and micro­
plastics (e.g., Pathak and Nichter 2021a). The phenomenon has not 
elicited much detailed social and behavioral research either. Most 
countries where open burning is widespread have legislation in place 
against the practice—why, then, does it continue unabated? In this 
article, we investigate this discrepancy through ethnographic fieldwork 
in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Zambia. We selectively high­
light examples of local patterns of open burning in these countries to 
make the case for the open burning of plastics as a critical—but largely 
overlooked—dimension of plastic pollution and a global health and 
development problem. Tracing the problem of plastic wastes back to 
unbridled plastic production, we go on to describe measures—beyond 
bans on open burning—to mitigate the most toxic aspects of this 
problem. 
2. Methods and theoretical orientation 
The cases featured here are drawn from long-term observations in 
diverse communities in India by the first and second authors. These were 
augmented by more targeted pilot fieldwork by members of our “Plastic 
Lives” consortium—a group of social science scholars investigating 
human–plastic entanglements throughout the plastic lifecycle. In India, 
ethnographic observation and unstructured interviews with those 
engaged in open burning were conducted in Arunachal Pradesh (Roing), 
Maharashtra (Dhule, Kolhapur, Mumbai, Pune, Talegaon), and Telan­
gana (Hyderabad). This was supplemented with fieldnotes from long- 
term observations in Gujarat (Kutch), Maharashtra (Mumbai, Tale­
gaon), Karnataka (Dakshin Kanara), and Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow) 
(Pathak and Nichter 2019; Pathak and Nichter 2021b). Building on in­
sights from India, our consortium developed a guide for focused 
ethnographic research on community and household burning practices. 
This guide was applied (December 2021–July 2022) in purposively 
selected communities in Zambia, the Philippines, and Indone­
sia—countries that differ in terms of policies against open burning. As a 
result of varied and dynamic COVID-19-related restrictions, the field­
work occurred in communities that the country researchers could access. 
In Indonesia, a focused ethnographic study was conducted by social 
science students from the Universitas Indonesia in three peri-urban 
communities located within a 50 km range from Jakarta: Bogor Dis­
trict (Citayam), Tangerang City (North Paninggilan), and Depok City 
(Cinangka, Sawangan). In each community, students conducted ten 
ethnographic interviews with those regularly engaged in burning, waste 
activists, local authorities, and private landfill operators. Those who 
regularly burn waste were asked to map out areas in their communities 
where waste was burned. The students validated their findings in six 
focus group discussions (two per site). 
In the Philippines, the focused guide was applied by anthropology 
students at the University of the Philippines. These students conducted 
fieldwork in their home communities (they were attending classes 
remotely at the time) in nine towns within the provinces of Tarlac, La 
Union, Eastern Samar, Laguna, South Cotabato, Aklan, and Dinagat 
Islands and within two towns in the vicinity of Metro Manila. They too 
conducted ten ethnographic interviews in each site and validated their 
findings in two focus group discussions. Participants were also asked to 
mark spaces in their immediate vicinity where they disposed of waste as 
part of a mapping exercise. 
In Zambia, the focused ethnographies were carried out in five com­
munities in the vicinity of Lusaka by two social science researchers from 
the University of Zambia. They conducted six interviews in each com­
munity, which were augmented by mapping areas where waste was 
burned. Participants were drawn from rural (low density) and urban 
(low, medium, and high density) areas and included low-, medium-, and 
high-income earners. The ethnographers in each of the country studies 
selected respondents who have experience with managing plastic waste, 
including waste collectors and workers at local waste disposal sites. We 
are writing up our focused ethnographic method for studying open 
burning practices in an article for Practicing Anthropology, in which we 
outline our interview guide, describe how we combine cartography and 
ethnography, and outline the ethics safeguards (i.e., assurances of ano­
nymity) needed when studying open burning practices in countries 
where such burning is prohibited. 
As anthropologists working at the interface of medical and envi­
ronmental anthropology and science and technology studies, we posi­
tion ourselves within an emerging transdisciplinary field dedicated to 
the study of cumulative toxicities as a feature of the Anthropocene. 
Studies within this field examine how entanglements between chemicals 
and humans have shaped ways of being and living in the contemporary 
world (e.g., Abrahms-Kavunenko 2021; Alaimo 2010; Checker 2007; 
Geissler and Prince 2020; Hardon 2021; Lee 2020; Liboiron, Tironi, and 
Calvillo 2018; MacLeish and Wool 2018; Murphy 2008; Nading 2020; 
Perczel 2021; Roberts 2017). Anthropological work on waste has 
emphasized the importance of ethnography in providing nuanced nar­
ratives of toxic waste management and in highlighting the failure of 
interventions to respond in locally salient ways. Research in Kampala, 
Uganda, by Jacob Doherty, for example, illustrates how heterogeneous 
policies that play out on the national and municipal levels allow for the 
amplification of what he terms the “politics of cleanliness” embedded in 
both moral and materials worlds (Doherty 2022:4). His work suggests 
that state-centric solutions that are increasingly shaped by global sus­
tainability policies may have limited impact on local waste management 
practices, including the burning of plastics and other toxic wastes. Even 
more compelling, Little’s (2021) ethnography of e-waste management in 
Ghana shows the ways that international policies and bilateral trade 
agreements often compound the problem of the accumulation of toxic 
waste in places where urban unemployment is experienced by national 
and municipal policymakers as a more pressing issue. The recovery of 
metals such as copper, silver, and gold from e-waste leads to a near- 
steady burn of toxic fires that are not only tolerated but held up as an 
example of job creation; our consortium’s work on South Africa has 
documented a similar theme (Musariri and Moyer 2022). Little draws 
upon Marder’s (2020) term “pyro-politics” to conceptualize this com­
plex interweaving of environmental, social, and economic reasoning 
that leads to a policy and legal domain that is patchy at best.

Elsewhere, we have referred to heterogenous plastics policies as 
“leaky by design” to highlight the ways that regulatory loopholes are 
exploited by producers, users, and those responsible for disposal to 
escape efforts to prevent ecological and human damage (Hardon et al., 
forthcoming). Green regulatory measures in one place (i.e., Europe or 
China), when combined with global circuits of production and trade, 
may result in “spillage” into other regions. Given these realities, we 
recommend a harm reduction approach for local interventions aimed at 
targeting those plastics and plastic packaging types that are most per­
nicious when burned. 
3. Policies against open burning 
The open burning of plastic wastes occurs even in countries with 
policies aimed at such open burning. We saw frequent and pervasive 
burning across our field sites despite laws in place against the practice. 
In India, the burning of plastic wastes in the open was banned in 2013 
(National Green Tribunal 2013). In response to the lack of imple­
mentation of this ban, a 2016 judgment set up fines of Indian Rupees 
5,000 (around USD 64) for “simple” burning and 25,000 (around USD 
320) for bulk waste burning (The Hans India 2016). In Indonesia, in our 
field site in Tangerang, the burning of wastes containing plastics is 
prohibited under the city regulation number 3 of 2009, article 19; ac­
cording to article 24, it carries a maximum imprisonment of three 
months or a maximum fine of Indonesian Rupiahs 50,000,000 (around 
USD 3,300) (Tangerang City 2009). The city regulation is in accordance 
with law number 18 of 2008 concerning waste management, article 29, 
which prohibits open burning that is not in accordance with the tech­
nical requirements for waste management in the country (Republic of 
Indonesia 2008). In the Philippines, the Clean Air Act of 1999 (Republic 
Act 8749) includes a ban on the incineration of waste, and the Ecological 
Solid Waste Management Act of 2001 (Republic Act 9003), sets the legal 
parameters for the country’s waste management, waste prevention, and 
recycling (Republic of the Philippines 1999, 2001). These laws are 
supplemented by ordinances by local government units. On the island of 
Panay, for example, we were told that the municipality penalizes waste 
burning with a fine of Philippine Pesos 2,000 (around USD 37) and one 
day of community service. In Zambia, the Statutory Instrument Number 
65 of the Solid Waste Regulation and Management Act, 2018, identifies 
the intentional open burning of any wastes and the burying of non- 
organic wastes as punishable offenses (Government Republic of 
Zambia 2018). 
Our research revealed four key, often overlapping, themes impli­
cated in the lack of efficacy of these policies. The most pervasive of these 
were 1) gaps in waste management services, including the absence of 
waste collection, constraints posed by the costs or time required to ac­
cess such collection, frictions between various arms of waste manage­
ment services, and a lack of effective ways of dealing with waste after 
collection. Related to this was 2) a focus on the aesthetics of place. Such 
a focus often resulted in 3) policies or interventions aimed at tackling 
plastic pollution that highlight litter and end up encouraging open 
burning. Overall, these dimensions were influenced by 4) assessments 
made by locals regarding the harms related to various ways of handling 
wastes. We now examine each of these four aspects further. 
4. Gaps in waste management services 
A vast body of literature within waste management and environ­
mental science has documented open burning as a common method for 
dealing with waste in locations with limited or inadequate waste 
collection services (e.g., Ajay et al., 2022; Ayelerua 2020; Chaudhary 
et al., 2021; Ferronato and Torretta 2019; Kov´ats et al., 2022; Naidja, 
Ali-Khodja, and Khardi 2018; Velis and Cook 2021; Wiedinmyer, 
Yokelson, and Gullett 2014). Many communities, whether urban, peri- 
urban, or rural, lack waste collection coverage. It is not uncommon for 
households and neighborhoods that are overburdened with wastes to be 
left to fend for themselves. Meanwhile, with economic development, 
consumption-oriented economies, and exponential growth in plastic 
packaging (not least as a result of contemporary manufacturing and 
supply chain infrastructures; see also Hawkins 2013, 2018), there has 
been an explosion in volumes of trash, especially non-biodegradable 
trash that lingers over long durations. Approximately two billion peo­
ple worldwide lack access to solid waste collection services, and they 
dispose of their trash through burying, burning, or dumping into wa­
terways or open ground (Reyna-Bensusan, Wilson, and Smith 2018). Our 
fieldwork confirmed that open burning was most commonly used as a 
waste management technique when waste collection was absent, but it 
also provided other ethnographic insights into this issue. 
We found that waste was burned even in areas with waste collection 
coverage because of the costs or wait times posed by these services. For 
example, in Indonesia, burning emerged as the most common way of 
getting rid of plastic wastes or reducing waste volumes in all three of our 
field sites, despite these sites being served by private waste collection. 
Open burning was seen as an option for those unwilling to pay the 
monthly collection fee of between Indonesian Rupiahs 25,000–50,000 
(approx. USD 2–4). In some cases, people reported burning small plastics 
along with organic wastes in their yard and setting aside larger plastic 
wastes for trash pickup. Households burned their mixed wastes every 
two days, either in the mornings between 10 and 11 am, after household 
cleaning, or between 4 and 5 pm, upon returning from work. Waste 
burning was also carried out at a community level by mutual agreements 
between households within a neighborhood. In these cases, households 
would be informed of the burning so that they could ensure that clothes 
were not left on clotheslines to be exposed to smoke. In the monsoons, an 
accelerant, such as gasoline, was used to ignite damp wastes. 
In Zambia, we heard of the burning of wastes not just as a result of 
garbage collection services being deemed unaffordable but also because 
collection was not frequent enough. As one community member noted: 
We burn unwanted plastic waste here. Every day after sweeping the 
surroundings we pick up the waste and burn it. Some of the plastics 
are not strong enough for reuse, easily tear up, therefore we burn 
them. Burning is not a good practice, but here we have no choice but 
to burn the plastic waste because waste is only collected once a week 
and the plastics easily fill up the trash bags. So, in order to avoid that 
and to prevent plastic from being blown by the wind in all directions 
and messing up the surroundings, we burn them. 
This frustration with long periods between garbage collection was 
echoed in the Philippines, where one resident put it succinctly: “the 
garbage man hardly ever comes by.” 
The contrasting interests and agendas of those involved in waste 
collection, sorting, and disposal also encouraged open burning. In the 
city of Dhule, India, a doctor running his own hospital recounted how 
mixed waste was burned in the open as a result of a lack of coordination 
between different arms of the municipal services. Municipal sweepers 
would clear out trash (leaves and branches but also littered plastic 
bottles and packaging waste) from the city’s gutters and collect that 
trash into small piles. However, these piles were erratically collected by 
the thekedaar, or contracted sanitary official. (Our interlocutor attrib­
uted this to corruption within the municipal body in the awarding of 
contracts.) The trash would get dispersed by winds or rain in the 
meantime, and the sweepers (typically women of the Dalit, that is the 
most marginalized, castes)—would be blamed. To avoid this, the 
sweepers would set the piles ablaze every week or so. Often, the doctor 
explained, the gathered trash would not be collected (nor set alight) for 
more than 4–5 days. When the trash piles built up near his hospital and 
started smelling, he would ask a nurse to set a match to them. Ninety 
percent of the time, he said, the piles would catch fire without an 
accelerant; otherwise, they would use “rockel” (kerosene). In Tanger­
ang, Indonesia, we similarly heard garbage collectors—who, as part of 
the informal economy, sell waste with scrap value—complain that local 
government officers charged them illegal fees to take the remaining 
G. Pathak et al.

wastes to the dumping ground; they practiced open burning to escape or 
reduce these fees. 
Such frictions were also implicated in large-scale fires at dumping 
grounds in India. Many countries in the Global South, such as India, rely 
on dumping grounds—rather than scientifically managed landfills—to 
house wastes; around 93 % to 66 % of the municipal solid waste in 
LMICs is deposited in dump sites (Sharma and Jain 2020). In 2016, a fire 
raged at Mumbai’s Deonar dumping ground—the city’s largest dumping 
ground—for a week (Earth Observatory 2016; Pinto 2016). Although 
that conflagration was novel in its scale and duration, it was not an 
isolated incident. Fires at dumping grounds are common, and Deonar 
regularly experiences them. Spontaneous fires can result from highly 
flammable landfill gases, which are the byproducts of the degradation of 
organic wastes, interacting with flammable plastic wastes in places with 
high ambient temperatures. However, several interlocutors in Mumbai, 
especially those working in the environmental or social justice spaces, 
suggested that fires at the Deonar dumping ground are often set inten­
tionally, as tactics in turf wars between gangs involved in the scrap trade 
or to allow valuable metal scrap to surface from garbage heaps. These 
suggestions were echoed in the media coverage of such fires (e.g., Sinha 
2018). 
Fires at dumping grounds can also be set intentionally to reduce 
waste volumes. In Zambia, we heard of constant burning at the Chunga 
dumpsite outside the city of Lusaka. “The fire at the landfill [dumpsite] 
has been burning for years, and it is rekindled every time the wind 
blows…That fire never burns out even during the rainy season,” an 
interlocutor complained. Similarly, in Indonesia, we were told that the 
owners of three private dumping grounds burned wastes daily. Burning 
took place in the afternoons and evenings, after wastes had dried in the 
sun. Such burning helped prevent garbage piles toppling over, hardened 
the soil on uneven land, and reduced the amount of waste in the 
dumping grounds. In the Philippines, prior to the passage of the Clean 
Air Act, dumping grounds all over the country were constantly burning. 
Low awareness regarding the prohibition against burning meant that 
interlocutors expressed sentiments such as, “If I don’t burn my trash, 
they will just put it in the dumping ground,” implying that it would be 
burned anyway. This was not unique to the Philippines; we heard 
several community members say that wastes would be burned at 
dumpsites anyway. In the absence of alternatives to burning in order to 
deal with ever-increasing volumes of waste at dumping grounds, in­
terlocutors saw small-scale burning as a more convenient, cheaper op­
tion. As we elaborate later, they also saw it as safer than the large-scale 
burning that occurred at dumping grounds. 
5. Focus on aesthetics of place 
The lack of affordable, frequent, and effective waste collection and 
disposal was complemented by an emphasis on aesthetics and cleanli­
ness in encouraging the burning of mixed wastes. In our sites in 
Indonesia, open burning was associated with mosque or community 
cleaning activities, usually conducted on Fridays. Friday, as a holy day, 
was considered auspicious for cleaning. Community members would 
take turns to clean their streets, waterways, and public facilities, with 
the wastes burned thereafter. These findings are in line with a study by 
Phelan et al. (2020) in a coastal community in Indonesia, which noted 
that village-level clean ups resulted in increased plastic burning. An­
thropologist Lukas Forte (personal communication, 2021) also observed 
open burning on the island of Sumbawa as a part of clean-up events. 
Similarly, in Dakshin Kanara, India, wastes, mostly plastic pack­
aging, were dumped by travelers along roadsides or rail tracks. When 
these wastes accumulated to the point of becoming an eyesore, they 
were periodically gathered up and set on fire by various community 
groups. Such activities occurred as part of routine clean-up activities. 
Clean-up activities that focused on public spaces and culminated in 
burning were especially pronounced in tourist destinations. Tourism is 
vital to the economy of many LMICs, and litter undermines the tourist 
industry’s efforts to market destinations (Williams et al., 2016). Plastic 
litter generated by both high consumption tourism and g/local marine 
flows (in the case of beaches) is a constant challenge (Hayati et al., 
2020). In the popular tourist destinations that we observed in South and 
Southeast Asia, piles of mostly plastic litter in tourist spaces were typi­
cally raked up and burned early each morning by restaurant/hotel 
managers and local vendors to maintain a pristine “front stage” image. 
Meanwhile, spaces frequented more by locals than tourists were left 
littered (see also Kerber and Kramm 2021 for similar observations in 
Vietnam). 
6. Policies targeting plastic pollution 
Policies and interventions that are ostensibly aimed at tackling 
plastic pollution were also revealed to inadvertently encourage open 
burning. For example, the state of Maharashtra, India, put in place a 
single-use plastic ban in 2018. Our ethnographic study in a residential 
complex located on the outskirts of a town in the state found that the 
local governing body, the gram panchayat, refused to collect Styrofoam. 
Styrofoam is a type of polystyrene, known locally as thermocol. Ther­
mocol had been included under the single-use plastic ban in Mahara­
shtra. However, it was still entering the complex as it was being used for 
packing, especially for goods bought online or shipped in from outside 
the state. With no way of disposing of the polystyrene, residents were 
forced to burn it at the peripheries of the complex. The ban, aimed at the 
reduction of plastic pollution, led to another form of pollution—the open 
burning of polystyrene, which produces the toxic styrene gas. 
Global, governmental, and media messages highlight plastic litter as 
a problem, and this has meant that other dimensions of plastic pollution 
get elided. Most policies and interventions aimed at plastic pollution 
focus on the aesthetic dimension, that is, on plastic litter (Pathak 2023). 
Sensitization to plastic litter also ends up, in many cases, favoring 
burning (Aarti Latkar and Gauri Pathak elaborate upon this in a forth­
coming publication). In India, campaigns such as the Clean India Mis­
sion—a national program aimed at waste management and the cleaning 
of India’s public spaces—have sensitized the public to litter and visible 
waste. Under the Mission, local governance bodies are incentivized to 
reduce the volumes of waste going to dumping grounds (by increasing 
recycling and composting); we heard that municipal officials and em­
ployees were therefore engaging in open burning. In Arunachal Pradesh, 
India, we similarly observed a guide for a trekking group gather the 
plastics he encountered on a trail and set them alight. When asked, he 
said he had been inspired by the Clean India Mission. 
In Citayam, Indonesia, we found that the local government had put 
up signs warning residents not to throw plastic trash into the Ciliwung 
river. Though households were plied by garbage collectors provided by 
the local government, the dumping ground that received wastes was 
over capacity. Moreover, garbage collectors would not handle litter 
dumped by passersby on roadsides. As a result, the community built 
small-scale kilns (tungku sampah) to burn household and community 
waste; one kiln was located near the river. Here again, an intervention 
aimed at keeping the river free of plastic wastes led to the burning of 
those wastes instead; the river was still being polluted but just in a 
different way. 
7. Assessments of risks and harms 
In the earlier paragraphs, we laid out the constraints faced by com­
munities and individuals in disposing of their plastic wastes. Against this 
highly constrained waste management landscape, residents individually 
and collectively make assessments regarding the harms posed by the 
alternatives available to them. In some cases, these assessments are 
based on a lack of awareness regarding the dangers posed by the emis­
sions and ash resulting from the burning of plastics. Thus, although the 
smoke and smell from burning were seen by our interlocutors as both­
ersome, the practice was not viewed as especially toxic. In the

Philippines, siga is the practice of morning and/or afternoon yard 
cleaning within the country; swept up leaves and litter are burned. 
Burning is thought to not only be an effective way of dealing with yard 
waste but also to serve as natural fumigation—the smoke keeps 
mosquitos and other pests away. The smoke is also likened to carbon, 
which plants are thought to need. Accustomed to burning yard waste, 
residents, particularly of rural areas, saw no harm in adding household 
wastes, including plastics, to the mix. In Indonesia, we heard from 
community members that the ashes from burning wastes—even plastic 
wastes—were thought to make plants grow better and used as fertilizer. 
In India, the burning of agricultural stubble is common, and in­
terlocutors recounted similar practices in rural fields to deal with lit­
tered plastics. Discarded plastic bags are used to ward off birds, and 
plastic wastes are often carried into fields by winds or rain and accu­
mulate there. After the harvest, farmers set fire to the stubble, and lit­
tered plastics get burned as well. Cultural notions of fire as purificatory 
mean that such burning is seen as relatively harmless. In Hinduism, fire 
is “an agency of destruction leading to possible rebirth” (Rosin 2000: 
395). Thus, not only fire but also the ashes it leaves behind are 
considered both purified and purifying (Rosin 2000: 362). Fire is 
thought to remove elements from the cosmological food chain, pre­
venting undigestible elements from entering ecologies. It therefore 
forms a seemingly ideal method of dealing with troublesome non- 
biodegradable wastes such as plastics. These attitudes to fire have also 
hampered a full appreciation among the public for the dangers of the 
inhalation of smoke from agricultural burning and indoor mud stoves. 
We also encountered the use of small plastics as fire starters for 
household wood-fired chul (mud stoves) in Maharashtra. “Patdishi pet 
dhartaya plastic mula [It catches fire instantly because of the plastic],” an 
interlocutor in Kolhapur explained. The women who described such use 
were typically from lower-income groups; although they had gas con­
nections that they used for everyday cooking, other chores, such as 
heating bathwater, relied on cheaper firewood. In the cities of Mumbai 
and Lucknow, we also observed workers on the night shift in the winters, 
especially night watchmen, light small bonfires by gathering dried 
leaves, twigs, and trash together. These bonfires included small plastic 
packaging wastes, which were not segregated out. In Ngwerere, Zambia, 
a school teacher described using plastic packets from small snacks (jig­
gies) as fire starters: “We collect them and use them to light cooking fires 
because they are quite flammable. The fire lights up quicker that way.” 
In Helen Kaunda, Zambia, they were used to light braziers in the com­
munity. Given the small quantities of plastics being burned, such 
burning was not deemed dangerous. 
Across our field sites, even when the burning of mixed wastes was 
recognized as harmful, harms were evaluated through the sensorial. 
That is, the color of the smoke and the smell were seen as indicators of 
harm. Thus, when trash was burned in a pit at the very center of a 
housing complex in India, residents complained that they could see and 
smell the thick, acrid smoke within their homes. Trash burning was 
therefore moved to the peripheries of the complex, even though it was 
close to a river. In the Philippines, we were told that when the smoke 
produced by burning was dark and the burning pile emitted a strong 
odor, people kept away from it, whereas white smoke with a “natural” 
odor was considered safe. 
Even sensory indices were seen to suggest more of a short-term 
bother than a long-term hazard. None of our interlocutors evidenced 
concern about the fact that the particulates and toxicants released by 
burning plastics can linger in the air for long periods, even after the 
smoke and smell have dissipated. This can be compared to perceptions of 
harm related to second-hand cigarette smoke—the smoke lingers in the 
air for several hours but is not considered dangerous when it can no 
longer be smelled (Padmawati et al., 2018). Moreover, frequent and 
long-term exposure to smells can lead to olfactory adaptations, 
rendering certain smells less perceptible. In Indonesia, interlocutors who 
burned their waste stated that none of their family members had expe­
rienced respiratory problems; some coughing was deemed a brief, 
“natural consequence” of smoke exposure. Community kilns were 
thought to be safe as they directed smoke upwards, away from people. 
Similarly, in Zambia, open burning was generally carried out when 
neighbors were asleep to avoid people’s exposure to smoke: 
There is no harm in burning the plastics because we do it at night and 
early in the morning while people are still sleeping…We wait for 
people to sleep before we burn the plastic and leaves. 
Given the use of the sensorial to assess harm, the volume of plastics 
getting burned was key to perceptions of and action against harm. 
Across field sites, people expressed concern about open burning at large 
dumping grounds. A Zambian interlocutor stated about fires at the 
dumping ground, “The problem is that the plastics that are burned 
produce fumes which might be responsible for some health problems 
some people have in this area…I know of a friend who has been com­
plaining of chest pains for over two years now and he lives opposite the 
landfill.” In Indonesia, interlocutors differentiated between smaller scale 
waste burning, which they saw as acceptable, and burning at dumping 
grounds, which they opposed. Fires at dumping grounds were consid­
ered harmful because they produced a haze and brought “strange” and 
“strong” chemical odors. Similarly, in India, whereas the small-scale 
burning of plastics was tolerated, the fires at the Deonar dumping 
ground, which involved many more plastics, thicker smoke, and a longer 
duration, elicited complaints from city residents. Such an assessment of 
harm encouraged small-scale burning as it was seen as less problematic 
than (often inevitable) burning at dumping grounds which are over 
capacity. Nonetheless, studies suggest that small-scale burning is more 
harmful than large-scale burning because people are exposed more 
closely and more frequently to the emissions (Ajay et al., 2022). 
Against this backdrop, interlocutors spoke of the perceived harms of 
letting wastes fester, which was the outcome of not burning those 
wastes. In Telangana, India, an interlocutor setting aflame a heap of 
mixed waste at a temporary dumpsite explained that he did so to 
eliminate the stench and to prevent seepage of leachate into the 
groundwater and his neighboring field. He also believed burning would 
prevent the spread of germs and infections from the garbage. In Zambia, 
concerns about menstrual blood being used in witchcraft led to used 
menstrual pads being burned in secret. The piling of ripe diapers be­
tween waste collection was meanwhile thought to be unhygienic and 
used diapers were therefore burned. 
Concerns regarding hygiene and contagion are particularly salient 
when it comes to the disposal of medical waste: incineration is thought 
to be best practice by many healthcare professionals because of a belief 
that this effectively kills pathogens (e.g., Gupta et al., 2009; Mbongwe, 
Mmereki, and Magashula 2008). In Dhule, India, however, our medical 
interlocutor expressed reservations regarding the fate of the medical 
waste that was collected, purportedly for incineration, from his facil­
ities. Medical waste collected for incineration in Dhule had been found, 
he told us, to be openly burned—and the collection fees illegally 
pocketed—a few years prior. 
However, it was not just the health risks that troubled inter­
locutors—aesthetics was a major focus, in all four countries. As an 
interlocutor in Ngwerere, Zambia, explained, “When I seriously come to 
think of it, burning plastics causes air pollution. However, we are often 
faced with a situation where we have to choose between unsightly 
surroundings or burning the plastic waste.” In fact, as described, we 
found that sensitization to plastic litter and waste—as a result of global 
and local campaigns and policies raising awareness about plastic 
pollution and the cleanliness of public spaces—led to community 
members conducting clean-up drives and burning wastes. Visible litter 
was not just a threat to tourism but also left the sense of a place not being 
tended to which distressed community members. Without alternative 
ways to manage wastes, open burning was considered a more benign 
option. 
Finally, it is worth highlighting two aspects related to the enforce­
ment of regulations against open burning. For one, public awareness of 
G. Pathak et al.

policies against open burning was relatively low across all our field sites. 
People were not always aware of specific restrictions, even if they had 
vaguely heard about them. Secondly, there were pragmatic and social 
relational reasons that policies were not stringently enforced. In 
Indonesia, for example, some residents who did not burn their trash 
were concerned about the smoke or worried that it would worsen family 
members’ respiratory disorders. However, they were reluctant to 
complain for reasons related to social risk. They wished to avoid conflict 
that might disrupt social relations. Social relations were also implicated 
in community members’ reluctance to complain about open burning at 
dump sites; people did not want conflict with the kin of those managing 
the sites. Furthermore, in contexts in which open burning occurs 
because of a lack of feasible alternatives for waste management—or 
because of a lack of money to pay for waste collection service­
s—enforcing policies, especially among low-income community mem­
bers, is not viable. It would likely result in community outrage and 
political ramifications. Concerns about social relations and the micro­
politics of community life in villages and towns make enforcing policies 
against open burning problematic. Thus, residents in Panay, the 
Philippines, told us that the rules related to open burning were “nego­
tiable” and added that “walang pangil ang batas (the law has no teeth).” 
Enforcement consisted of, at best, token gestures. 
8. Toward harm reduction 
In the face of these local constraints and concerns—and their 
rendering of policies against open burning largely unenforceable—what 
can be done to reduce the harms of the burning of plastic wastes? First, 
two notes of caution. For one, we must recognize that the open burning 
of wastes is an act of care. It is undertaken to reduce unsightliness and 
risks of contagion and infection. Practices of open burning mark off 
spaces as places—as the sites of community attention, concern, and 
effort. In fact, throughout our fieldwork, we found that spaces where 
wastes were left to accumulate were a “no-man’s land”—zones of 
abandonment and apathy. Any measures to tackle the harms of open 
burning must recognize the labor and local capacities required by the 
practice, and interventions must leverage—rather than devalue—these 
capacities. 
Second, we must recognize that the problem of open burning is not a 
problem of unhygienic or ignorant citizens in the Global South. Open 
burning is not unique to the Global South. Even the plastic wastes that 
are burned in these regions are implicated in global flows of plastics, for 
example, through plastics carried by ocean currents and deposited onto 
distant seashores or plastic wastes dumped in LMICs under the guise of 
recycling. The open burning of plastics is symptomatic of communities 
overburdened with the wastes of a global “cannibal” capitalist economy 
(Fraser 2022) that revolves around ever-increasing consumption 
regardless of its ecological costs. Burdening these communities further, 
by raising awareness regarding the harms of burning without providing 
locally viable alternatives for waste disposal, will not only prove fruit­
less but is also grossly unfair. Many anti-litter campaigns, for example, 
emphasize the removal of litter as normative behavior but fall short of 
providing effective, convenient means for disposing of this litter. Indeed, 
as we have shown, such campaigns end up encouraging open burning. 
Ultimately, then, addressing the harms of the open burning of plastic 
wastes will require interventions at the level of not just disposal—the 
creation of affordable, reliable, and effective trash collection and end- 
stage processing alternatives that build upon local capacities—but also 
at the level of production, through a reduction in the manufacturing and 
consumption of plastics, a turn toward greater reuse, the use of less toxic 
plastic additives, and the phasing out of forms of packaging (e.g., multi- 
layer packaging and multi-polymer packaging) and plastics (e.g., poly­
carbonate) that cannot be easily recycled. This may sound utopian and 
unpragmatic. It will undoubtedly take several decades to make such a 
shift. As we work toward these larger goals, what steps can we take in 
the meantime for harm reduction? One place to begin is to focus on those 
plastics that are most toxic when burned. 
When burned, some plastics are less harmful than other types that 
yield emissions and residues linked to severe environmental and human 
health problems; see Table 1 (Alabi et al., 2019; Lebek et al., 2005; 
McKenna and Hull 2016; Morikawa and Yanai 1989; Sovov´a et al., 2008; 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2011; Valavanidis et al., 2008; 
Velis and Cook 2021; Verma et al., 2016; Wakefield 2010; Wheatley 
et al., 1993). The burning of Styrofoam (polystyrene) or polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC), is, for example, extremely dangerous—such plastics 
release especially toxic styrene gas, dioxins, or chlorinated furans when 
ignited. Interactions between these plastics and other wastes can also 
lead to toxic emissions mixes. 
Recognizing the reality that these plastics and packaging types will 
likely end up being burned, we recommend 1) reductions in the use of 
these plastics and packaging types wherever possible, incentivized 
through higher taxation and caps on production, 2) local campaigns 
raising awareness about the toxicity of the ash left behind by open 
burning to prevent use of this ash as fertilizer, and 3) extended producer 
responsibility (EPR) schemes that task manufacturers with collecting 
and safely—and under regular monitoring—recycling or disposing of 
the post-consumer wastes that result. 
Policies related to EPR were introduced in India in 2016, but they 
have been criticized for being vague and unclear on several counts,

including who is to be held financially liable (the plastic resin manu­
facturer, the packaging maker, or the brand owner) and to whom they 
would be answerable (local or national pollution control boards). The 
role of the informal economy and waste pickers within such schemes 
was also not entirely clear (Pani and Pathak 2021). Since then, EPR 
policy has undergone several refinements, and the latest set of amend­
ments has set down targets and timelines for the collection of volumes of 
types of plastic wastes and the reuse of recycled materials. Nevertheless, 
implementation remains problematic, and third-party monitoring 
mechanisms have not been set in place (Shah 2022). We suggest that to 
be truly successful, EPR schemes will need to go beyond these measures 
and take advantage of local capacities by providing incentives, not just 
to waste pickers but also to community members, for the segregation 
and return of plastic wastes. 
In India, we encountered an environmental initiative termed Safai 
Bank (https://safaibank.org) that can serve as an example. As part of this 
initiative, students were asked to collect their multi-layer packaging 
wastes for use as fuel stock (co-processing) in cement kilns. Burning in 
cement kilns can be problematic in India as a result of the inadequate 
regulation of emissions, but what we wish to foreground here is the 
leveraging of students for waste management. Student volunteers were 
provided with certificates and other rewards for their efforts. EPR ini­
tiatives based on local capacities, such as this one, would require an 
easily identifiable label on these types of packaging and plastics com­
bined with campaigns to create awareness about these labels and about 
the EPR schemes. 
9. Conclusion 
In this article, we have focused on community and household prac­
tices related to the open burning of plastics despite existing laws and 
policies meant to discourage those practices. At a time when global and 
regional actors are increasingly committed to developing greater 
accountability though a global plastics treaty, ethnographic research 
can provide insights into the limits of policy-based interventions. This is 
especially the case in contexts where waste management is largely 
carried out through informal networks that routinely escape governance 
attempts and in a world where wastes, plastic and otherwise, are 
increasingly exported from wealthy countries to be disposed of, recy­
cled, or processed in LMICs. 
Given the increased attention in policymaking to limiting plastic 
pollution, as anthropologists of science and technology, we draw atten­
tion to the ways that legal categorizing, in this case, distinguishing be­
tween plastics in and out of place or waste that is properly or mis- 
managed, may help to conceal the larger problems of exponential in­
creases in plastic production and distribution, global flows of plastic 
waste into marginalized communities, and the limits of plastics’ recy­
clability. The implementation and oversight of policies and laws re­
quires the resources, capacity, infrastructure, and political will to do so. 
In practice, our research has shown that governments may find it diffi­
cult to implement policies banning single-use plastics or the open 
burning of (plastic) waste for a variety of reasons. They may also 
encounter widespread resistance when they try to enforce said policies, 
from interests ranging from multinational companies to waste pickers. 
We have suggested that while big shifts toward plastic control are 
debated, put into practice, and assessed, some initial steps may be taken 
in the name of harm reduction. These steps revolve around recognizing 
the realities of open burning and focusing on those plastics and pack­
aging types that are the most dangerous to burn. Our embracing of a 
harm reduction strategy, as a first step in tackling open burning, is 
pragmatic. We hope it will curb the most toxic aspects of the problem 
and lead to public demand for and support of better plastic control 
policies that make sense in place. Our reason for this strategy can 
perhaps best be summed up in one Zambian interlocutor’s statement, 
which was echoed across field sites: “We burn a lot of plastics because 
we are not sure which ones are harmful.” Such statements reference a 
desire to know more and a willingness to mitigate harms.

BACKGROUND: Prescribed agricultural burning is a common land management practice, but little is known about the health
effects from the resulting smoke exposure.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between smoke from prescribed burning and cardiorespiratory outcomes in the U.S. state
of Kansas.
METHODS: We analyzed a zip code-level, daily time series of primary cardiorespiratory emergency department (ED) visits for
February–May (months when prescribed burning is common in Kansas) in the years 2009–2011 (n = 109,220). Given limited
monitoring data, we formulated a measure of smoke exposure using non-traditional datasets, including ﬁre radiative power and
locational attributes from remote sensing data sources. We then assigned a population-weighted potential smoke impact factor
(PSIF) to each zip code, based on ﬁre intensity, smoke transport, and ﬁre proximity. We used Poisson generalized linear models to
estimate the association between PSIF on the same day and in the past 3 days and asthma, respiratory including asthma, and
cardiovascular ED visits.
RESULTS: During the study period, prescribed burning took place on approximately 8 million acres in Kansas. Same-day PSIF was
associated with a 7% increase in the rate of asthma ED visits when adjusting for month, year, zip code, meteorology, day of week,
holidays, and correlation within zip codes (rate ratio [RR]: 1.07; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.13). Same-day PSIF was not
associated with a combined outcome of respiratory ED visits (RR [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.97, 1.02]), or cardiovascular ED visits (RR [95% CI]:
1.01 [0.98, 1.04]). There was no consistent association between PSIF during the past 3 days and any of the outcomes.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest an association between smoke exposure and asthma ED visits on the same day. Elucidating
these associations will help guide public health programs that address population-level exposure to smoke from prescribed
burning.

INTRODUCTION
Wildland ﬁre smoke is associated with irritation of the respiratory
system, exacerbations of chronic diseases such as asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and premature mortality
[1, 2]. Exposure to smoke is particularly hazardous for individuals
with preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease [3].
Large-scale prescribed agricultural burning, a contributor to
wildland ﬁre smoke emissions, is a common land management
practice. Prescribed burning of invasive vegetation and old growth
returns nutrients back to the soil and can be beneﬁcial to the
surviving plants and landscapes [4]. It is used to reduce fuel
loading in forested and agricultural areas and hence potentially
prevent wildﬁres, and also used to enhance native vegetation, and
maintain ecosystems [4, 5]. The smoke from prescribed burning
contains numerous air pollutants including particulate matter,
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic com-
pounds [5]. The known health effects of inhalation of air pollution
include detrimental effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory
systems [6].
Although the impact of prescribed burning on air quality is well
described [7–11], research on its impact on health is limited [7, 12].
Results from the few studies on the health effects of prescribed
burning suggest adverse health impacts from this practice. One
study conducted in the southeastern United States estimated a
modest increase in emergency department (ED) visits for asthma
due to exposure to smoke from prescribed burning [13]. A second

study conducted in this region used information from burn permits
and concentration-response functions to estimate that prescribed
burning is associated with asthma ED visits, hospital admission for
respiratory reasons, and premature death [14]. In a different region
of the United States, a study in the Paciﬁc Northwest used a health
impact assessment tool and observed associations between
prescribed burning and an increase in respiratory symptoms,
bronchitis, lost days of work, and death [15].
The Flint Hills region of Kansas and northern Oklahoma is a
tallgrass prairie where approximately 2 million acres are cleared by
prescribed agricultural burning each spring [16]. Burning in this
region promotes the growth of desired grass species and controls
woody species growth ultimately resulting in increased cattle
weight gain [17, 18]. These burns are a substantial contributor to
air pollution [19, 20]. Levels of air pollution that exceed the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards have been recorded in
Kansas and nearby states following prescribed burning activities
[18]. In 2017, it was estimated that prescribed burning was
responsible for 44% of primary ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5)
emissions in Kansas, compared with only 14% nationally [21].
Despite elevated air pollution levels, the health effects of smoke
exposure resulting from prescribed burning in Kansas is currently
unknown. This
study
sought
to determine
the
impact
of
prescribed agricultural burning on cardiorespiratory ED visits in
Kansas.
MATERIALS/SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We conducted a time series study in the state of Kansas using a
measure of smoke exposure formulated from non-traditional
datasets and daily zip-code level cardiorespiratory ED visits from
2009 to 2011.
Limited air quality monitoring data were available for the region
and time period of interest. Additionally, we found no accessible
information on the dates and locations of prescribed burns. In the
absence of this information, we used remote-sensing data and
model-based predictions to calculate a “potential smoke impact
factor” (PSIF; described below) and used the PSIF to characterize
population-level exposure to smoke from agricultural burning. We
downloaded burn-related information from the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Fire Information for
Resource Management System [22]. Speciﬁcally, we obtained
information from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, which identify
ﬁre pixels that have had one or more ﬁres. From these 1×1
kilometer (km) pixels, we extracted information on maximum ﬁre
radiative power (FRP) for each day in our spatial and temporal
domains. Typically, FRP is used to ascertain emission rates and
factors [23–26], but for this assessment we used it to approximate
ﬁre intensity.
Initially, we considered using a distance-weighted measure of
FRP for each block group without considering other meteorologic
factors. However, as highlighted by Waller and colleagues [27],
distance-weighting alone will not capture the true “exposure
potential” as air pollutant impacts may depend not just on
distance to emission sources but also on other factors such as
wind characteristics. Hence, population-exposure resulting from
ﬁres with differing ﬁre intensities was estimated factoring in both
smoke dispersion and proximity to each ﬁre location. Smoke
dispersion from the location of each individual ﬁre was assumed
to be heavily inﬂuenced by wind speed and direction as
agricultural burning happens over grasslands with no signiﬁcant
elevation differences.
We combined information on ﬁre intensity with estimates of
surface meteorological parameters generated from the North
American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS) model
[28]. First, we created eight wind sector designations of 45° each
based on a continuous measure of wind direction (i.e., 22.5°–67.4°,
67.5°–112.4°,
112.5°–157.4°,
157.5°–202.4°,
202.5°–247.4°,
247.5°–292.4°, 292.5°–337.4°, 337.5°–22.4°). Using hourly wind
characteristics, we calculated daily wind probability and speed
for each of the eight wind-sector designations, for each ﬁre pixel
and separately for each U.S. Census block group. We also created a
distance matrix, providing the distance between each ﬁre pixel
and block group in Kansas. We limited the radius of inﬂuence for
each ﬁre to block groups within 100 km. After using wind direction
and location to identify block groups that potentially could receive
smoke from a ﬁre due to congruent wind direction, we used the
inverse of the squared distances between centroids of each block
group and ﬁre pixel as weights to calculate a daily smoke
exposure metric for each block group. Of note, using a distance-
weighted approach is common in environmental health, especially
to assign pollution impacts from a speciﬁc source [27, 29, 30]. We
then generated population-weighted estimates of this potential
smoke impact factor (PSIF) at the zip code level from block group
level estimates to align with the geographic resolution of the
available health data.
We evaluated the PSIF metric using the limited available air
quality monitoring data. During the period of this analysis, air
quality data were available on PM2.5 and ozone from 4 air quality
monitors, coarse particulate matter (PM10) from 2 air quality
monitors, and carbon monoxide from 1 air quality monitor. PM2.5
was sampled every 3 to 6 days; all other pollutants were sampled
daily. The monitors were located in the cities of Wichita, Peck,
Topeka, and Olathe; all in Eastern Kansas. We matched PSIF data
with air monitoring data by zip code and estimated Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient (r).
We analyzed a zip code-level, daily time series of primary
cardiorespiratory ED visits for the years 2009–2011. We examined
three outcomes: (1) asthma ED visits (2) respiratory ED visits
including asthma, wheeze, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections, and (3)
cardiovascular ED visits including ischemic heart disease, dys-
rhythmia, congestive heart failure, and ischemic stroke (Interna-
tional

Modiﬁcation [ICD-9-CM] codes listed in Table 1). Daily counts of
ED visits for each outcome were calculated for each zip code in
Kansas from individual-level data. We used zip code of patient
residence for aggregating ED visits; ED visits were excluded if the
patient resided outside the state of Kansas. ED data were obtained

from the Kansas Hospital Association (KHA) and the Veterans
Health Administration. On average, ED data were available from
100 KHA hospitals each year, representing approximately 73% of
KHA member hospitals in Kansas during this period. Data were
obtained from all Veterans Affairs hospitals in Kansas.
We used Poisson generalized linear models that accounted for
overdispersion to estimate the association between PSIF (same-
day [lag 0] and 3-day moving average [lag 0–2], i.e., same day and
two previous days) and asthma, respiratory, and cardiovascular ED
visits. Analyses were restricted to the months when prescribed
burning is common in Kansas (February–May) and to zip codes
with at least one primary asthma ED visit and one primary
cardiovascular ED visit during the analysis months. The distribu-
tion of PSIF was highly skewed towards 0 and was modeled in two
ways: (1) a binary variable (presence vs. absence of smoke
exposure) and (2) a 4-level variable (zero vs. tertiles of non-zero
exposure). All models were implemented using generalized
estimating equations with a ﬁrst-order autoregressive correlation
structure to allow for correlation within zip code. Covariate control
for temporal and meteorologic factors was based on a previously
developed model for estimating the association between air
pollution and cardiorespiratory outcomes [31]. Adjusted models
controlled for parametric cubic splines with monthly knots, year,
zip code, day of week, holidays, cubic polynomials for lag 0
maximum temperature, cubic polynomials for lag 0 mean dew
point, and cubic polynomials for lag 1–2 moving average
minimum temperature (for models assessing 3-day moving
average PSIF exposure).
For models with results indicating a health effect of prescribed
burning, we also considered a negative control exposure (NCE) to
evaluate residual confounding, model miss-speciﬁcation and
measurement error. In these analyses, we added PSIF 2 days in
the future to the model and assessed its association with the
outcome of interest. This negative control approach uses the fact
that a future exposure cannot cause past health outcomes to
assess potential biases [32–34]. We used PSIF 2 days in the future
(rather than the typical 1 day used in this approach) because there
is a morning satellite pass that may identify ﬁres that started late
on the previous day and were hence not captured in the previous
day’s exposure estimate.
All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA) and R 4.02 [35]. This activity was reviewed by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was conducted
consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (See e.g.,
45C.F.R. part 46, 21C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. §241(d); 5 U.S.C. §552a;
44 U.S.C. §3501 et seq.).
RESULTS
During the study years (2009–2011), prescribed burning took
place on approximately 8 million acres in Kansas [36]. PSIF levels
were highest in April, the month when prescribed burning was
most frequent (Table 2, Fig. 1). Levels were highest in the Eastern
part of the state where the Flint Hills region is located (Fig. 1).
Comparing the PSIF to the limited available air quality monitoring
data, there was moderate overall correlation between PSIF and
PM2.5 (r = 0.33) with correlation at individual air monitors ranging
from a minimum of r = 0.16 to a maximum of r = 0.49. Poor
correlation was observed between PSIF and other air pollutants,
such as, ozone, PM10, and carbon monoxide.
Between February–May, 2009–2011, 9,824 primary asthma ED
visits, 69,620 primary respiratory ED visits, and 39,600 primary
cardiovascular ED visits were identiﬁed in the health dataset
(Table 1). Of these ED visits, 98% were to KHA hospitals with the
remaining 2% to Veterans Affairs hospitals. The average patient
age was 41 years old; 34.7% of ED visits were to individuals under
the age of 18 (Table 3). Approximately half of visits were to
patients of female sex (49.2%). The majority of visits were to
patients of White or Black race (72.3% and 10.7% respectively) and
non-Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (81.0%). Counts of asthma ED
visits peaked in the spring and fall months (Fig. 2).
Having a non-zero PSIF level was associated with a 7% increase
in the rate of asthma ED visits on the same day in both unadjusted
and adjusted models (rate ratio [95% conﬁdence interval (CI)]: 1.07

[1.02, 1.13], 1.07 [1.01, 1.13] respectively) (Table 4). When
comparing tertiles of exposure to a reference group of non-
exposure, adjusted rates of asthma ED visits on the same day were
3% higher in the ﬁrst tertile, 10% higher in the second tertile, and
7% higher in the third tertile (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.03 [0.93, 1.15],
1.10 [1.01, 1.19], 1.07 [0.99, 1.15] respectively) than rates in the
reference group of no exposure (PSIF = 0). Having a non-zero
three-day moving average PSIF level was associated with a 2%
increase in the rate of asthma ED visits when adjusting for
covariates (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.97, 1.08]) (Table 4). When
comparing tertiles of 3-day moving average exposure to a
reference group of non-exposure, the pattern was not monotonic;
adjusted rates of asthma ED visits were 4% higher in the ﬁrst
tertile, 2% lower in the second tertile, and 6% higher in the third
tertile (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.04 [0.96, 1.12], 0.98 [0.92, 1.05], 1.06
[0.99, 1.04], respectively) than rates in the reference group of no
exposure.
For the analysis between PSIF modeled as a binary variable and
asthma, we evaluated the association of a NCE with the outcome,
adding PSIF 2 days in the future to the model. We found no
meaningful association between the future variable and asthma
(results not shown) and inclusion of the future variable did not
change the association between same-day PSIF and asthma. For
this model to converge, we omitted zip code control for which
had little impact in the main analyses.
When examining respiratory ED visits including asthma (Table 1),
we found no evidence of an association with PSIF level. The
adjusted rate ratios for both same-day PSIF level and 3-day
moving average PSIF level were close to the null value of 1 (rate
ratio [95% CI]: 0.99 [0.97, 1.02], 0.99 [0.97, 1.01], respectively) as
were most of the rate ratios when comparing tertiles of exposure
to a reference group of no exposure (Table 4).
For cardiovascular ED visits, we found no consistent evidence of
an association with PSIF level. Having a non-zero PSIF level was
associated with a 1% increase in the adjusted rate of ED visits on
the same day (rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.01 [0.98, 1.04]), and having a
non-zero 3-day moving average PSIF level was associated with a
3% decrease in the adjusted rate of ED visits (rate ratio [95% CI]:
0.97 [0.94, 0.99]). When comparing tertiles of exposure to a
reference group of no exposure, results were mixed, with some
results suggesting an increased rate of ED visits with increasing
level of PSIF and other results suggesting a decreased rate of ED
visits with increasing level of PSIF (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest an association between smoke exposure
during the months when prescribed burning is common (i.e.,
February–May) and asthma ED visits on the same day. Although
negative controls are less than 100% sensitive for detection of bias
due to confounding or model misspeciﬁcation, the results of our
NCE analyses showed no indication of major modeling or
confounding issues impacting this result. We found no consistent
evidence of an association between smoke exposure and all
respiratory ED visits or cardiovascular ED visits. This study adds to

the limited previous research suggesting adverse health impacts
of smoke exposure resulting from prescribed burning.
Public health ofﬁcials and land managers can take steps to limit
exposure to smoke from prescribed burning. During seasons of
prescribed burning activities, health departments can educate
residents about protecting themselves from smoke exposure
using some of the same actions recommended during episodes of
wildﬁre smoke, including monitoring local air quality and keeping
indoor air clean [3]. These precautions are particularly important
for individuals at the highest risk for health impacts from smoke
such as those with preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular
disease. For land managers, the Kansas Flint Hills Smoke
Management Plan details ﬁre management practices that can be
used to help limit smoke from prescribed burns [18]. These
practices include using environmental and air quality conditions
to inform when to burn and reducing fuel loads prior to burning.
In the Flint Hills Region of Kansas, expanding the timing of
prescribed burning to help diminish resulting smoke concentra-
tions may also be an option [37, 38].
This study expands the scope of literature on the health
effects of prescribed burning by being conducted in the state of
Kansas and by using a different approach to estimating
exposure to smoke from prescribed burning. Combining multi-
ple environmental datasets to create the PSIF metric allowed us
to estimate zip-code level exposure to smoke from prescribed
burning
in
the
absence
of
robust
monitoring
data.
The
combination
of
remote
sensing
data
with
surface
wind
characteristics allowed us to identify communities that are
impacted by smoke from these ﬁres. Because burning in Kansas
occurs on a large-scale and in grasslands with a ﬂat terrain,
remote sensing data is expected to perform well at capturing
prescribed burns in Kansas. However, our PSIF metric will not
capture smoke exposure resulting from secondary formation
and may misclassify exposure resulting from long-range trans-
port of smoke and air pollution from sources that are outside of
Kansas. Improving record keeping on the location and timing of
prescribed burns along with increasing air quality monitoring in
areas with prescribed burning could help reduce any potential
exposure misclassiﬁcation in future studies addressing the
health impact of burning activities.
We should consider several potential limitations in addition to
creating exposure measures from non-traditional data sources.
Although exposure to and the impacts of smoke from prescribed
burning may be larger in certain demographic groups, we did
not examine potential differential effects by race, ethnicity, or
socioeconomic factors. By examining combined outcomes of
respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, we may have masked
true associations with individual respiratory or cardiovascular
conditions. Using zip code as the spatial unit of analysis has
limitations because zip codes do not align directly with the
spatial unit of data collection for health or environmental
factors. We observed low correlations between the PSIF metric
and air quality monitoring data; the limited availability of
monitoring data prevented us from determining how represen-
tative these results may be for the full study region. We
estimated ambient smoke exposure which may differ from
personal smoke exposure due to behavior modiﬁcations such as
avoiding going outside on days with poor air quality or using
indoor air ﬁltration systems. Although we adjusted for a wide
range of potential confounders, given the large number of
factors that can impact cardiorespiratory exacerbations it is
possible that uncontrolled confounding may have impacted
ﬁndings. Examples of potential confounders that were not
accounted for include additional meteorological factors, area-
level socioeconomic status, and land use factors. A previous
study in the state of Georgia observed higher levels of social

vulnerability in areas impacted by prescribed burning [14]. If the
same association exists in Kansas, social vulnerability could
potentially confound the results of this study given the known
disparities in cardiorespiratory outcomes by components of
social vulnerability such as socioeconomic status and race
[39, 40].
The data for this study are for the years 2009 to 2011.
Nevertheless, prescribed burning is still a common practice in
Kansas. During the years of this study, an average of approxi-
mately 2.7 million acres were burned in prescribed ﬁres each year
in the Flint Hills region of Kansas. Comparatively, between 2019
and 2021, in the same region, an average of approximately 2.4
million acres were burned annually [36]. Given the similarities in
acreage burned, we anticipate that our results are relevant to the
health impacts of prescribed burning in Kansas today.
Prescribed burning is a common agricultural practice in Kansas and
in many other geographic locations. In this study using ED data from
across Kansas and a novel metric of smoke exposure, we observed an
association between smoke during the months in which prescribed
burning is common in Kansas and asthma ED visits. Continuing to
elucidate the impact of smoke from prescribed burning on health will
help guide public health programs that address population-level
smoke exposure. Educating the public on protecting themselves from
the smoke of prescribed burning and ensuring that land managers
take steps to limit smoke production from these burns may be
important steps to help limit health impacts.

Research
On 1 June 2008, a lightning strike initiated 
a fire in the eastern plains of North Carolina. 
Low humidity and prolonged drought con­
tributed to the spread of the fire into the 
Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, 
where it smoldered through rich deposits of 
peat. Peat in the refuge was, on average, 3 ft 
and in places up to 15 ft deep. Poor oxygen 
supply during combustion of carbon in the 
decomposing vegetation produced massive 
amounts of smoke. The region exposed to the 
hazardous levels of air pollution generated by 
the fire was largely rural, sparsely populated, 
and economically disadvantaged.
To investigate health effects associated 
with this fire, we obtained data on daily 
emergency department (ED) visits for car­
diac and respiratory conditions for eastern 
North Carolina counties reported through 
the statewide syndromic surveillance system. 
Satellite measurements of aerosol optical 
depth (AOD) were used to determine a 3‑day 
window of dense plume. We estimated rela­
tive risks (RRs) associated with these days and 
5‑lag days for the counties most impacted by 
the smoke plume and the surrounding, less 
impacted, referent counties.
Air pollution is a complex mixture of 
gases and particles whose toxicity depends 
on the type of fuel and conditions of com­
bustion. There are > 100 epidemiological 
studies demonstrating mortality and morbid­
ity associated with both chronic and acute 
exposures to air pollution, mostly focused 
on emissions of burning fossil fuels in auto­
mobiles, diesel engines, and coal- or oil-fired 
power plants [U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) 2009b]. During episodes of 
wildfires, affected regions experience acute 
exposures, with concentrations that are orders 
of magnitude larger than observed in urban 
centers. However, health implications of the 
exposure to wildfire emissions are less well 
understood (Naeher et al. 2007). In contrast 
to health studies of urban air pollution, wild­
fire studies are constrained by the size and 
distribution of the exposed population, 
duration of the episode, and the retrospec­
tive accessibility of data on exposure and 
health outcomes. The most comprehensive 
studies, conducted for forest fires near large 
metropoli­tan areas, have reported significant 
increases in symptoms and exacerba­tions 
of under­lying respiratory illnesses (Delfino 
et al. 2009; Duclos et al. 1990; Johnson et al. 
2005; Künzli et al. 2006). Less-conclusive 
results have been found within smaller cohort 
and convenience sample–based studies and 
less-populated regions (Moore et al. 2006; 
Mott et al. 2005). The effects of exposure on 
cardio­vascular outcomes have been reported 
with more varied results (Delfino et al. 2009; 
Moore et al. 2006; Mott et al. 2005; Sastry 
2002; Vedal and Dutton 2006), in part due 
to lack of statisti­cal power.

Background: In June 2008, burning peat deposits produced haze and air pollution far in excess 
of National Ambient Air Quality Standards, encroaching on rural communities of eastern North 
Carolina. Although the association of mortality and morbidity with exposure to urban air pollu­
tion is well established, the health effects associated with exposure to wildfire emissions are less well 
understood.
Objective: We investigated the effects of exposure on cardio­respiratory outcomes in the population 
affected by the fire.
Methods: We performed a population-based study using emergency department (ED) visits 
reported through the syndromic surveillance program NC DETECT (North Carolina Disease Event 
Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool). We used aerosol optical depth meas­ured by a satellite 
to determine a high-exposure window and distinguish counties most impacted by the dense smoke 
plume from surrounding referent counties. Poisson log-linear regression with a 5‑day distributed lag 
was used to estimate changes in the cumulative relative risk (RR).
Results: In the exposed counties, significant increases in cumulative RR for asthma [1.65 (95% 
confidence interval, 1.25–2.1)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1.73 (1.06–2.83)], and 
pneumonia and acute bronchitis [1.59 (1.07–2.34)] were observed. ED visits associated with cardio­
pulmonary symptoms [1.23 (1.06–1.43)] and heart failure [1.37 (1.01–1.85)] were also significantly 
increased.
Conclusions: Satellite data and syndromic surveillance were combined to assess the health impacts 
of wildfire smoke in rural counties with sparse air-quality monitoring. This is the first study to 
demon­strate both respiratory and cardiac effects after brief exposure to peat wildfire smoke.

Climate-related changes and past land-
use practices are expected to increase the risk 
of wildfires in upcoming decades (National 
Interagency Fire Center 2009). In addition to 
the forests, of particular concern is the vulnera­
bility of large deposits of peat bogs to wildfires. 
Peat soil accounts for approximately 2% of 
global land cover, mostly in the boreal regions, 
where it has been traditionally harvested for 
energy. In drought conditions, peat bogs are 
exceptionally susceptible to ignition, can smol­
der indefinitely, and are notoriously difficult to 
extinguish. Although less common than for­
est fires, they have an important impact on 
regional climate and ecosystems. In 1997, 
Indonesian peat fires released the equivalent 
of 13–40% of the mean annual global car­
bon emissions from fossil fuels and contributed 
to the largest annual increase in atmospheric 
carbon dioxide (CO2) in four decades (Page 
et al. 2002). Despite the large impact of peat 
fires on the environment, significantly less is 
known about the associated health effects. 
One study of the Indonesian fires reported 
> 500 haze-related deaths, 290,000 cases of 
asthma exacerbation, 58,000 cases of bronchi­
tis, and 1,440,000 cases of acute respiratory 
infection between September and November 
1997 (Kunii et al. 2002).
Methods
We obtained daily counts of ED visits 
from the North Carolina Disease Event 
Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool 
(NC DETECT 2010), a statewide, early-event 
detection and public health surveillance sys­
tem that records daily ED visits from 111 of 
114 civilian North Carolina EDs. We con­
sidered visits for selected cardio­vascular and 
respiratory outcomes by adults throughout the 
eastern portion of the state, as well as county 
of residence, sex, age, date of admission, and 
discharge ICD‑9‑CM [International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(U.S. Public Health Service and Health Care 
Financing Administration 1980)] codes for all 
visits. Prior to the analysis, outcomes of inter­
est were defined through ICD‑9‑CM codes 
for asthma (493), chronic obstructive pulmo­
nary disease (COPD) (491–492), pneumo­
nia and acute bronchitis (481, 482, 485, 486, 
and 466), upper respiratory tract infections 
(URIs) (465), heart failure (428), cardiac dys­
rhythmia (427), and myo­cardial infarction 
(410, 411.1). ICD‑9‑CM codes grouped into 
all respiratory and all cardiac outcomes are 
listed in Table 1. Cardio­pulmonary symptoms 
(ICD‑9‑CM code 786) were grouped sepa­
rately. For respiratory-related outcomes, the 
population was stratified into two age groups: 
19–64 years and ≥ 65 years. The small num­
bers of ED visits for respiratory-related events 
in those < 19 years of age precluded analy­
sis of this subgroup. Cardiac outcomes were 
also stratified into two age groups: 45–64 years 
and ≥ 65 years. There were not enough visits 
for cardio­vascular events for people < 45 years 
of age to be informative. The population was 
dichotomized to differentiate causes of cardio­
vascular outcomes associated with ischemic 
heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction, 
which are less prevalent in the younger popula­
tion. The human subjects institutional review 
boards of the University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill, East Carolina University, and 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
approved the study. 
The study period was defined as the time 
between the onset of the wildfire through 
mid‑July when controlled flooding, increased 
humidity, and the first rainfall largely con­
tained the fire (1 June–14 July 2008). During 
this period, average daily temperatures ranged 
from 69 to 86oF, with overnight lows always 
< 75oF [see Supplemental Material, Figure 1 
(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003206)]. 
For most of the period, winds blew from the 
west, and smoke affected only a few sparsely 
populated neighboring counties. However, 
on 10 June, easterly winds directed the smoke 
plume inland, exposing a large portion of 
eastern and central North Carolina for a 
3‑day period (Figure 1A–C). On 12 June, the 
maximum 1‑hr concentration of fine particu­
late matter with diameter ≤ 2.5 µm (PM2.5) 
exceeded 200 μg/m3 at ground-based moni­
tors located 200 km from the fire. We defined 
10–12 June as a window of high exposure, 
and estimated risks associated with the expo­
sure days and a 1‑ to 5‑day lag period after 
each exposure day relative to the non­exposed 
days of the 6‑week study period. Figure 2 
illustrates the window of exposure and lagged 
days of exposure along with the daily asthma 
visits. The RRs for lag days 0–5 were summa­
rized to define cumulative risk of exposure. 
County-level exposure to the plume was 
classified using AOD, measured by instru­
ments aboard a geo­stationary operational 
environ­mental satellite. AOD is a unit­less 
measure with scale from 0 to 2 of the atmo­
spheric scattering and absorption of light by 
aerosols, where larger values indicate higher 
concentration of particles in the atmosphere 
and lower visibility. Half-hour, 4 × 4 km 
resolution grid maps of AOD were aver­
aged over the available daytime hours. AOD 
has been shown to be a good surrogate for 
boundary layer fine particulate matter con­
centrations and a predictor of the Air Quality 
Index, a nationally uniform index for report­
ing daily air quality (Al-Saadi et al. 2005; 
Engel-Cox et al. 2004; U.S. EPA 2009a; 
Wang and Christopher 2003). Typical back­
ground levels of AOD for this region were 
well below 0.5. Based on the sharp difference 
between the high-density plume and back­
ground, we chose an AOD of ≥ 1.25 as an 
indicator of the high-density plume. Counties

with a minimum of 25% of the geographic 
area exceeding this threshold were defined as 
exposed to the smoke plume for each day in 
the high-exposure window. The operational 
algorithm of the satellite considers high AOD 
values created by strong reflectance from 
clouds as unreliable and removes them from 
the standard data product. At times, the dense 
smoke plume was classified as a cloud, result­
ing in missing AOD values on the interior 
of the plume. We considered such values as 
right-censored and classified the respective 
grid cells as exposed to the plume.
The study population resided in 42 contig­
uous counties in eastern North Carolina. One 
sparsely populated county (Gates County) was 
significantly impacted by another wildfire and 
was excluded from this analysis. Counties with 
smoke exposure on at least 2 days were con­
sidered exposed (18 counties in Figure 1D). 
The 23 referent counties were exposed 1 day 
(15 counties) or < 1 day (8 counties). The 
populations of exposed and referent counties 
are similar with respect to age structure, 
ethnicity, population density, and socio­
economic status. Counties in eastern North 
Carolina are more rural and agricultural, with 
a higher percentage of African Americans, 
and of lower socio­economic status than most 
of the remaining North Carolina counties.

Material, Table 1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/
ehp.1003206).
We applied a Poisson regression model to 
daily counts of ED visits for combined and 
individual cardio­vascular and respiratory out­
comes separately, with explanatory variables 
indicating days within the 3‑day window of 
dense smoke and subsequent 5 days of lagged 
exposure. The RR associated with days in 
which a county was exposed to wildfire smoke 
(and corresponding 5 lag days) was compared 
with other days in which that county was not 
exposed to smoke. For non­exposed (refer­
ent) counties, RR was calculated using the 
same days as were used for the exposed coun­
ties. RR was estimated separately for exposed 
and referent counties. The effects of exposure 
on outcomes at lags was estimated using an 
unconstrained distributed lag model (Peng and 
Dominici 2008). Previous studies (Braga et al. 
2001; Pope et al. 2008) have determined that 
air pollution produces immediate and delayed 
effects on morbidity and mortality and that 
the time to adverse outcome may vary by pol­
lutant and health outcomes. From the perspec­
tive of public health, in the present study we 
were interested in the total burden on human 
health associated with the wildfire episode. 
Inference on delay between the exposure and 
effect is not appropriate for this study without 
personal exposure measurements. Here, the 
results are reported in terms of the cumula­
tive relative risk (cRR), that is, cumulative risk 
over lag days 0–5 after exposure (Peng and 
Dominici 2008) according to

by age and sex in both exposed and referent 
county cohorts.
Results
Asthma-related visits accounted for 44% of all 
respiratory codes considered, and heart fail­
ure accounted for 33% of all cardiac events. 
Consistent with the distribution of asthma 
prevalence by sex, the aggregate counts of 
asthma-related visits occurred in more women 
(70%) than men and in more individuals 
between 19 and 64 years (85%) compared 
with those ≥ 65 years of age. Cardiac events 
were substantially more common in individu­
als ≥ 65 years (67%) compared with those 
45–64 years of age. The number of clinical 
events reported for each ICD‑9‑CM code 
during the study period is given in Table 1.
In the exposed counties, ED visits for 
several outcomes were significantly increased 
during the high-exposure days and subse­
quent lag days compared with visits during 
the remainder of the 6‑week study period in 
the exposed counties (Figure 3). ED visits 
for all the respiratory diagnoses were elevated 
in the exposed counties [cRR = 1.66; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.38–1.99] but not 
in the referent counties [1.06 (0.89–1.25)]. 
Among the respiratory outcomes, ED vis­
its for asthma [1.65 (1.25–2.17)], COPD 
[1.73 (1.06–2.83)], and pneumonia and acute 
bronchitis [1.59 (1.07–2.34)] increased sig­
nificantly. Visits for URIs [1.68 (0.94–3.00)] 
also increased but were not statistically signifi­
cant. We found no significant differences in 
respiratory outcomes when cumulative risks 
over the same calendar days were estimated 
for the referent counties.
In the exposed counties, cRR for heart fail­
ure–related ED visits [cRR = 1.37 (95% CI, 
1.01–1.85)] during the 3 high-exposure days 
and 5 subsequent lag days was increased com­
pared with other days, whereas visits for myo­
cardial infarction and cardiac dysrhythmias 
were not increased for the same time periods 
in exposed or referent counties. Reflecting 
the increase in cardiac and respiratory events, 
ED visits associated with cardio­pulmonary 
symptoms (ICD‑9‑CM code 786) were sig­
nificantly increased [1.23 (1.06–1.43)] in the 
exposed counties.
Associations with respiratory outcomes 
varied by age and sex, and stratified analy­
ses reflected higher uncertainty because of 
lower counts of events in these subgroups. In 
exposed counties, visits for asthma, pneumo­
nia, acute bronchitis, and URI increased to 
a greater extent among women than among 
men (Figure 4A). In contrast, visits related to 
COPD were elevated only in men in exposed 
counties. There was a greater increase in ED 
visits for asthma, COPD, pneumonia, and 
acute bronchitis during exposed versus unex­
posed days among individuals < 65 years of age 
compared with those ≥ 65 years in the exposed 
counties (Figure 4B). We observed no differ­
ences in ED visits for cardio­vascular events 
stratified by age or sex, possibly because the 
smaller number of visits for these ICD‑9‑CM 
codes diminished the power to observe effects 
in these subgroups.
Discussion
This is the first population-based health study 
of peat bog fire exposures using a syndromic 
surveillance system with a nearly comprehen­
sive record of health outcomes from an entire 
geographic region. We estimated the cRR of 
ED visits for cardio­respiratory outcomes asso­
ciated with 3 high-exposure days and their 
corresponding 5 lag days. The study demon­
strates that exposure to smoke from the wild­
fire increased ED visits for asthma, COPD, 
pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and heart failure 
in a sparsely popu­lated non­urban area. The 
study also demon­strates the utility of syndro­
mic surveillance in assessment of health bur­
den during widespread environ­mental events. 
In turn, such assessments should help guide 
develop­ment of strategies and the allocation of 
resources for the public health response.
Consistent with the results from other 
studies, asthma-related outcomes were most 
prevalent, especially among adult women. A 
surprising and important observation is the 
statistically significant association between 
smoke exposure and an increase in ED visits 
for heart failure, as well as the trend toward a 
positive association with acute coronary syn­
drome (myo­cardial infarction and unstable 
angina). We restricted the cardio­vascular clini­
cal end points to acute coronary syndrome, 
which included myocardial infarction and 
unstable angina (ICD-9 410 and 411.1) and 
heart failure (ICD-9 428) and excluded hyper­
tensive heart disease. Although previous stud­
ies have shown positive associations between 
ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and ED vis­
its and hospitalization for heart failure (Brook 
et al. 2010; Dominici et al. 2007; Wellenius 
et al. 2005, 2006), to our knowledge this is 
the first study that has reported ED visits for 
heart failure associated with wildfire exposure. 
However, epidemiologic studies in areas with 
high residential wood burning have suggested

that an increased risk of cardio­vascular mor­
tality and morbidity may be due, in part, to 
wood smoke emissions (Sanhueza et al. 2009; 
Schwartz et al. 1993). Our study demon­
strated an increased percent change in RR of 
37%. Compared with the rest of the state, 
counties of eastern North Carolina are among 
the poorest and least healthy counties, charac­
terized by higher prevalence of hypertension, 
diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and heart fail­
ure (North Carolina State Center for Health 
Statistics 2009). These are clinical conditions 
that are associated with individuals more vul­
nerable to the health effects of ambient air 
particle pollution and may have contributed 
to the large number of events in this relatively 
sparse population (O’Neill et al. 2005, 2007; 
Wellenius et al. 2005).
Unlike the hot canopy forest fires often 
seen in the western portion of the country, 
the Pocosin fire was not associated with high 
temperatures and heat waves. Instead, a pro­
longed drought led to the unusually dry con­
ditions in the region that allowed for rapid 
spread of fire across the peat bogs after a light­
ning strike. Therefore, it is not surprising that 
we did not observe long-term linear trends or 
seasonality for the principal respiratory and 
cardiac diagnoses during this study period 
as shown for visits for asthma (Figure 2). 
However, at least three types of mis­classifi­
cation in exposure could have occurred in the 
study. First, any days with elevated AOD lev­
els outside the 3‑day window were classified 
as unexposed days, which could have resulted 
in a bias toward the null hypothesis. Second, 
some of the referent counties were exposed 
to emissions from the fire at some point dur­
ing the 6‑week period, although not to the 
extent of the exposed counties, also poten­
tially resulting in bias toward the null hypoth­
esis. Finally, some misclassifi­cation at the 
individual level may have occurred because 
of differences in exposure between county 
groups. According to information from the 
2000 census (U.S. Census Bureau 2010), 
exposed counties are demographically simi­
lar to but more rural than referent counties, 
which may have resulted in a higher exposure 
[see Supplemental Material, Table 1 (http://
dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1003206)]. However, 
no individual data were available for the anal­
ysis. Well-documented risks of increased mor­
bidity and mortality due to air pollution have 
been based largely on central site monitoring 
and time-series studies of health outcomes 
within major urban centers. Rural and remote 
areas are often not studied because of sparse 
population and lack of monitoring data. The 
type and availability of monitoring most often 
found in sparsely populated areas, such as in 
this study, provide limited information about 
the geographic scope of exposure times of 
environ­mental events. Air pollution monitors 
collect data at irregular temporal resolution 
(e.g., every 24 hr, every 3 days, every 6 days) 
and do not provide comprehensive informa­
tion regarding the geographic scope of the 
exposure, depending on monitor location, 
wind direction, and terrain (e.g., differences 
in elevation). Developing new methods for 
assessing exposure will be increasingly more 
important as wildfires and other environ­
mental events become more frequent. Several 
computer models for atmospheric pollutant 
dispersion already exist but are difficult to 
vali­date against sparse ground measurements. 
In this study we used satellite-derived meas­
ure­ments of AOD to define spatial boundar­
ies of the smoke plume. This allowed us to 
capture the geographic extent of ED visits 
in the region and thereby increase statistical 
power. Such exposure assessment, however, 
allows us to associate changes in RR to the 
exposure period but not to the concentration 
of air pollutants.
Central reporting of ED visits and the 
high rate of case identification afforded by the 
NC DETECT syndromic surveillance sys­
tem contributed to the strength of the asso­
ciations we found in this study. Syndromic 
surveillance systems were developed to detect 
epi­demics and monitor outbreaks in near real-
time (Buehler et al. 2008). The program is 
implemented at the state level; the median rate 
of hospital participation in the United States is 
35% and ranges between 2 and 100%. Most 
states report chief complaint data alone, but 
a few, including North Carolina, report diag­
nostic ICD‑9‑CM codes. North Carolina has 
a uniquely comprehensive program, with 98% 
of its hospitals participating. Two other studies 
of health effects of wildfires in California and 
Florida (Johnson et al. 2005; Sorenset et al. 
1999) used syndromic surveillance data and 
reported increases in respiratory outcomes, 
asthma, respiratory complaints, eye irritation, 
and smoke inhalation for respiratory-related 
chief complaints. The strength of evidence 
found in the present study further supports 
efforts to expand automated surveillance sys­
tem for near-real-time delivery of informa­
tion and health advisories during emergencies. 
Although ICD‑9‑CM codes are not as timely 
as chief complaints, they can provide more 
specific measure­ments of health outcomes and 
should be added to syndromic surveillance 
systems in other states.
Peat fires burn significantly more biological 
mass, produce massive amounts of smoke, and 
are notoriously more difficult to extinguish 
than hot canopy forest fires or grassland fires 
(Muraleedharan et al. 2000; Page et al. 2002; 
See et al. 2007; Soja et al. 2004). One study of 
peat fire particle composition reported carbo­
naceous particles, particularly organic carbon,

nitrate, and sulfate as major components of 
PM2.5, whereas the less-abundant constitu­
ents included ions such as ammonium, nitrite, 
sodium, potassium; organic acids; and metals 
such as aluminum, iron, and titanium (See 
et al. 2007). In another study, Muraleedharan 
et al. (2000) reported carbon monoxide, CO2, 
and methane to be the most abundant gas­
eous emissions. Although emissions from peat 
fires may differ from those from forest fires in 
chemical composition, it is not known if they 
differ in toxicity.
Population growth and land use alterations 
are the primary bases for increased wildfire 
events worldwide. Additional stress is created 
by earlier snow melts, rising temperatures, 
cumulative effects of the current drought, 
and other climate-related changes (National 
Interagency Fire Center 2009; Westerling et al. 
2006). Recent peat fires around Elektrogorsk, 
Russia, exemplify the synergistic effect 
of these factors and their impact on health 
and economy in the region (Reilly 2010). 
Unprecedented hot and dry weather in Russia 
during the summer of 2010 eased the spread 
of fires in swamps long ago drained to har­
vest energy from peat. The smoke obstructed 
ground and air travel and resulted in numer­
ous health advisories (Williams 2010). Peat 
bogs have been exploited for energy use in 
many parts of the world, leaving vest areas of 
dried wetlands and swamps particularly vul­
nerable to droughts. Therefore, the risk of peat 
fires is likely to increase in upcoming decades 
(National Interagency Fire Center 2009).
Conclusion
The consistent increase in RR in the exposed 
counties for nearly all outcome cate­gories dur­
ing and up to 5 days after exposure to wild­
fire smoke is striking and persuasive and has 
potentially significant public health implica­
tions. The precision of RR estimates in this 
study is attributed to the use of comprehen­
sive population health data from the North 
Carolina public surveillance program as well 
as to the use of spatially and temporally dense 
satellite measure­ments of AOD. The region 
of the state most affected by the smoke was 
sparsely populated, with few available air qual­
ity monitors. Therefore, traditional exposure 
assessment based on moni­toring and hospital 
admissions data alone would not provide us 
with enough information to assess the true 
risk. Both data sources used in this study are 
readily available to state and local public health 
officials and lend themselves to the applica­
tion of traditional statistical methods. In the 
near future, public health officials may benefit 
from dashboard-like visualization tools that 
allow end users to overlay environmental data 
with health care data to improve event charac­
terization capabilities and response efforts. 
Mitigation of exposure and raising public 
awareness would be expected to decrease the 
burden to the health care system and improve 
the well-being of the public.

In Brazil, sugarcane ﬁelds are often burned to facilitate manual harvesting, and this burning causes
environmental pollution from the large amounts of soot released into the atmosphere. This material
contains numerous organic compounds such as PAHs. In this study, the concentrations of PAHs in two
particulate-matter fractions (PM2.5 and PM10) in the city of Araraquara (SE Brazil, with around 200,000
inhabitants and surrounded by sugarcane plantations) were determined during the sugarcane harvest
(HV) and non-harvest (NHV) seasons in 2008 and 2009. The sampling strategy included four campaigns,
with 60 samples in the NHV season and 220 samples in the HV season. The PM2.5 and PM10 fractions
were collected using a dichotomous sampler (10 L min1, 24 h) with Teﬂon ﬁlters. The ﬁlter sets were
extracted (ultrasonic bath with hexane/acetone (1:1 v/v)) and analyzed by HPLC/Fluorescence. The
median concentration for total PAHs (PM2.5 in 2009) was 0.99 ng m3 (NHV) and 3.3 ng m3 (HV). In the
HV season, the total concentration of carcinogenic PAHs (benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)ﬂuoranthene,
benzo(k)ﬂuoranthene, and benzo(a)pyrene) was 5 times higher than in the NHV season. B(a)P median
concentrations were 0.017 ng m3 and 0.12 ng m3 for the NHV and HV seasons, respectively. The
potential cancer risk associated with exposure through inhalation of these compounds was estimated
based on the benzo[a]pyrene toxic equivalence (BaPeq), where the overall toxicity of a PAH mixture is
deﬁned by the concentration of each compound multiplied by its relative toxic equivalence factor (TEF).
BaPeq median (2008 and 2009 years) ranged between 0.65 and 1.0 ng m3 and 1.2e1.4 ng m3 for the
NHV and HV seasons, respectively. Considering that the maximum permissible BaPeq in ambient air is
1 ng m3, related to the increased carcinogenic risk, our data suggest that the level of human exposure to
PAHs in cities surrounded by sugarcane crops where the burning process is used is cause for concern.

1. Introduction
São Paulo State (SE, Brazil) has the largest area of sugarcane
plantations in the country and is responsible for 60% of the national
production (UNICA, 2010). The city of Araraquara, located at central
area from São Paulo State, has around 200,000 inhabitants and is
surrounded by sugarcane plantations (46,994 ha of total cultivated
area, in the harvest 2008/2009) (INPE, 2010a).
In the sugarcane harvest season, from May to November, the
crops are burned to facilitate the process of manual harvesting. The
burning protects the cane cutters from the cutting leaves and
snakes, and increases the sugar content by weight due to water
evaporation (Zamperlini et al., 2000). This process causes envi-
ronmental pollution from the large amounts of dust and ash that
are released into the atmosphere. This particulate matter (PM)
contains mutagenic/carcinogenic contaminants such as polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Andrade et al., 2010a, submitted for
publication; Umbuzeiro et al., 2008; Bosso et al., 2006; Godoi et al.,
2004; Azevedo et al., 2002; Santos et al., 2002). These compounds
are ubiquitous in the environment, and 16 PAHs are included in the
priority list of pollutants of the US Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA, 1998). Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer-
related mortality in Western countries, and its pathogenesis
involves the accumulation of multiple molecular abnormalities
over a long period of time and has been associated to PAHs expo-
sure (Farmer et al., 2003; Lewtas, 2007; Silva et al., 2006). Several
other cardiovascular, respiratory and reproductive effects has been
reported for PAH human and animal exposure (Brito et al., 2010;
Lewtas, 2007; Cançado et al., 2006).
PAHs are compounds derived from incomplete combustion and
pyrolysis of fossil fuels and other organic substances, and have many
natural and anthropogenic sources. For the most part, however, they
are generated from anthropogenic sources such as vehicular emis-
sions (Callén et al., 2008; Tavares et al., 2004; Nielsen et al., 1999),

biomass burning (Ströher et al., 2007; Magalhães et al., 2007;
Simoneit, 2002; Zamperlini et al., 1997), and waste incineration
(Chen et al., 2008). PM is one of the main air-pollution problems
resulting in hospital visits, as observed by Arbex et al. (2000). The
characteristics of the PM2.5/PM10 fraction of particulate matter have
received much attention because of their possible health impact
(Pengchai et al., 2009; Ravindra et al., 2008). Determination of
individual types of particle-bound PAHs is very important because
compounds with more rings have the greatest toxicological interest
(Viana et al., 2008; Omar et al., 2006; Pozzoli et al., 2004).
The World Health Organization recommends a maximum
permissible concentration of 1 ng m3 benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the
atmosphere, based on the carcinogenic potential of inhaled
particulate PAHs (Ravindra et al., 2008). The carcinogenic risk
assessment of PAH remains difﬁcult due to the very high number of
these contaminants (in the hundreds) present in complex samples
such as airborne particulate matter.
Considering that benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is the most studied PAH
with regard to the risk of cancer, a TEF (Toxic Equivalent Factor) was
proposed to measure the relative toxicity of a speciﬁc PAH in
relation to BaP (Nisbet and LaGoy, 1992). Speciﬁcally, the concen-
tration of each PAH classiﬁed as carcinogenic is multiplied by the
TEF and then summed to provide an estimative of the benzo[a]
pyrene
equivalent
concentration
(BaPeq)
in
ambient
air.
In
a mixture of PAHs, the total TEF can be related to the potential
increase in cancer risk (Jung et al., 2010; Pengchai et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2009; Barbosa et al., 2006).
The main objective of this study was to assess the potential cancer
risk associated with human exposure to PAH in outdoor air in a city
surrounded by sugarcane plantations (Araraquara, SE Brazil) in two
seasons: non-harvest (NHV) (DecembereMarch) and harvest (HV)
(AprileNovember) seasons. This study may also provide useful
information about the potential health risks from sugarcane burning,
and to support environmental policies related to atmospheric limits
of PAHs and sugarcane harvesting, including the burning process.
2. Material, methods, and sampling
2.1. Chemicals and apparatus
The solvents used, acetone, n-hexane, and acetonitrile, all HPLC
grade, were purchased from JT Baker (Xalostoc, Mexico). Ultra-pure
water was obtained from a Milli-Q system (Waters, Midford, MA,
USA). All solvents were analyzed for possible contamination by the
use of procedural blanks. PAH standards (purity grade >99%) were
acquired from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA), including naphtha-
lene (Naph), acenaphthene (Aceph), ﬂuorine (Flu), phenanthrene
(Phe), anthracene (Ant), ﬂuoranthene (Flt), pyrene (Pyr), benz[a]
anthracene(B(a)A), chrysene (Chry), benzo[b]ﬂuoranthene (B(b)F),
benzo[k]ﬂuoranthene (B(k)F), benzo[a]pyrene (B(a)P), benzo[e]
pyrene (B(e)P), dibenz[ah]anthracene (D(a,h)A), and benzo[ghi]
perylene (B(ghi)P). Indene[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (Ind) was purchased
from Dr. Ehrenstorfer (Augsburg, Germany). For the sampling, the
polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) ﬁlters (37 mm  2 mm porosity)
were purchased from Pall Corporation (New York, NY, USA). A
dichotomous sampler (10 L min1, PM2.5 and PM10), “Harvard” type,
constructed at Harvard University (Boston, MA, USA).
2.2. Instrumental analyses
The analyses were performed using a Varian HPLC/Fluorescence
Model LC920 (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA, USA) equipped with
a Supelcosil LC-PAH column (25 cm  4.6 mm, 5 mm) (Supelco,
Bellefonte, PA, USA). A gradient of acetonitrile/water (T ¼ 25 C) was
used beginning with 60% acetonitrile (5 min), followed by a linear
gradient (20 min), until reaches 100% acetonitrile, remaining for
15 min in isocratic elution with acetonitrile. The ﬂow rate was
1.5 mL min1. The sample volume injected was 20 mL. For the PAHs
ﬂuorescence detection a wavelength program was used: 0e9.7 min:
excitation wavelength (lex) 220 nm and emission wavelength (lem)
322 nm [for Naph, Aceph, and Flu detection]; 9.8e29.3 min: 240 nm
(lex) and 398 nm (lem) [for Phe, Ant, Flt, Pyr, B(a)A, Chry, B(b)F, B(k)F,
B(a)P, B(e)P, D(a,h)A and B(ghi)P detection ]; 29.4e35.0 min :
300 nm (lex) and 498 nm (lem) for Ind detection.
2.3. Site characterization and sampling
Particulate matter <2.5 mm (PM2.5) and <10 mm (PM10) were
sampled in Araraquara (21 4703100S and 48 100520’W) at Southeast
Brazil (Fig. 1). A dichotomous sampler operating with an average
ﬂow rate of 10 L min1 was placed at a height of 2 m at a sampling
site located at the Institute of Chemistry of São Paulo State
University (UNESP), in a suburban area of Araraquara. The closest
sugarcane ﬁelds are approximately 5 km distant.
The PM2.5 fractions were collected for 20 days in February 2008,
170 days in AprileNovember 2008, 20 days in JanuaryeFebruary
2009, and 30 days in MayeJuly 2009. The PM10 fractions were
collected for 20 days in FebruaryeMarch 2009 and for 20 days in
JulyeAugust 2009. Each ﬁlter was exposed for 24 h, and then
wrapped in aluminum foil, labeled, and stored at 17 C.
2.4. PAH extraction
The PAHs were extracted from the sampled PM2.5 and PM10
ﬁlters using n-hexane:acetone (1:1) solvent, according to the
procedure evaluated previously by Cristale (2008). Brieﬂy, the
method consists of extracting ten PTFE ﬁlters with three washes of
30 ml hexane:acetone (1:1), in an ultrasonic bath (Thornton, Vin-
hedo, SP, Brazil) for 10 min at 40 Hz. The extract was concentrated
in a rotary evaporator (40 C) until its volume was reduced to about
10 ml, and then to dryness with nitrogen ﬂow. The dry residue was
dissolved in 0.50 ml acetonitrile, followed by HPLC-FL analysis.
PAH recoveries from particulate matter were evaluated by
analysis of standard reference material (SRM 1649a), and recoveries
were between 74 and 95% (RSD < 20%). Naph, Aceph, and Flu
showed low recoveries due to high vapor pressures, therefore these
PAHs were not evaluated in this study.

2.5. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical
cluster analysis (HCA)
Ward’s hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), which identiﬁes
homogeneous groups of samples, was employed according to the
average
linkage
between
groups
method
on
the
Euclidean
distances matrix. PCA was used to reduce the set of original vari-
ables (measured PAHs content in the particulate matter samples)
and to extract a small number of latent factors (principal compo-
nents, PCs) for analyzing relationships among the observed vari-
ables. Individual PAHs concentrations were used as HCA and PCA
parameters (both seasons) allowing the summarized data to be
further analyzed and plotted. The number of factors extracted from
the variables was analyzed according to Kaiser’s rule (Stevens,
2002). This criterion retains only factors with eigenvalues > 1.
Statistica 7.0 (StatSoft, 2009) was used for these analyses.
3. Results and discussion
According to HCA data treatment, the concentrations of PAHs
differed in the two seasons (HV and NHV) to 61% of samples. Fig. 2
shows PAHs data (median, 25e75% percentiles and the minimum
and the maximum concentration) in NHV and HV seasons.
The cluster analysis (Fig. 3) indicated the presence of three data
groups. Groups 1 and 2 correspond mainly to HV and NHV samples,
respectively; while the third group includes samples collected in
rainy days in both seasons. The lower concentrations of PAHs were
found for group 3 samples. Fig. 4 shows two different behaviors:
positive correlation between PAH concentrations and burning focus
number occurring in the São Paulo state (INPE, 2010b), and nega-
tive correlation between PAH concentrations and accumulated
rainfall in Araraquara city (São Paulo, 2010a). Wang et al. (2010)
reported that PAHs in rain water from Mount Taishan, in China,
have signiﬁcant correlations with rainfall intensity corroborating
with our data.
Because the inﬂuence of the rainfall events, the data from group
3 from HCA were excluded of the PCA analysis, that was performed
only with data from groups 1 and 2, indicating that 80.1% of the
total variance of data is explained by three major components. The
PC1 and PC2 represent 68.6% of total variance, while PC3 explains
11.5% of observed variance. Table 1 shows the loadings of the most
important factors for each principal component.
PC1 explained 53.6% of data variance. The substances that had
high loading (>0.7) were: Phe, Flt, and Pyr. According to Simoneit
(2002), these substances are associated with burning grass, then
PC1 was mainly associated with the burning of sugarcane. In PC2,
BaA, BkF and BbF showed high loadings. These PAHs are considered
markers of vehicle emissions (Daisey et al., 1979; Harkov and
Greenberg, 1985; De Luca et al., 2004), thus PC2 was mainly asso-
ciated with the gasoline, and diesel combustion emissions. The PC3
explained 11.5% of total variance. Due to the low loading we could
not associate this component with a speciﬁc source. As a part of
statistical analysis was used a biplot graph (Fig. 5) to present the
position of HV/NHV samples and PAH components together.

3.1. Distributions of PAHs in atmospheric particles
Total PAHs levels in HV season were 6.3, 3.3, and 8.9 ng m3 for
PM2.5 (2008), PM2.5 (2009), PM10 (2009), respectively. These values
are comparable to PAHs concentrations in PM10 at same sampling
point
obtained
by
Andrade
et
al.
(2010a)
in
2002e2003
(12 ng m3), whereas lower than concentrations reported in São
Paulo city (65.1 ng m3) (De Martinis et al., 2002) and in Hong Kong
(38 ng m3) (Guo et al., 2003), but higher than in Rio de Janeiro
(2.2 ng m3) (Quiterio et al., 2007).
The genotoxic behavior of PAHs is associated with the number of
their aromatic rings (WHO, 2005). In PM2.5/PM10, the distribution
of the aromatic rings showed the same proﬁle for both seasons (HV
and NHV). PAHs containing 4, 5, and 6 aromatic rings accounted for
31, 17, and 46%, respectively, of the data presented in this work.
These compounds are of great interest because they are considered
genotoxic (WHO, 2005).
The median concentration of PAHs in PM2.5 in the HV season
decreased 30% from 2008 to 2009. This decreasing can be explained
by the decreasing of the burning focus in São Paulo State, that were
1629 in 2008 and 1314 in 2009 (INPE, 2010b), during the same
months as our sampling campaigns were done, i.e., a year-to-year
reduction of 20%.
The use of diagnostic ratios to identify PAH sources can give
some indication about the impact of different sources of particulate
matter (Pio et al., 2001). For example, the Ind/(Ind þ B(ghi)P) ratio
in PM2.5 (NHV) in 2008 was 0.21  0.04, indicating that there are
contribution of vehicular emissions to these contaminants into
airborne particulate matter. (Ravindra et al., 2008). However, for
PM2.5 (NHV) in 2009, the same ratio was 0.52  0.08 indicating coal
emissions (Ravindra et al., 2008), but this type of fuel is not used in
any activity near Araraquara city. The use of diagnostic ratios to
identify PAH sources can give contradictory results, e.g., Li and
Kames (1993) attribute a Flt/[Flt þ Pyr] ratio of 0.56  0.05 the
source comes from wood carbonization while Rogge et al. (1993)
and Mandalakis et al. (2002) found the same ratio (>0.5) indi-
cates combustion of diesel. Therefore, in this article we prefer do
not to use the diagnostic ratio to discuss the PAH sources.
Median values of individual PAHs concentrations in PM2.5 and
PM10 in NHV and HV season are presented in Table 2. In order to
compare the seasons, the values between the detection (LOD) and
quantiﬁcation (LOQ) limits were assigned with ½ LOQ as the PAH
concentration.
3.2. Cancer risk assessment
Some compounds found in the samples are considered carci-
nogenic and/or mutagenic, including B(a)A, B(b)F, B(k)F, B(a)P, Pyr,
D(a,h)A, and Flt (WHO, 2005). Because of the carcinogenic/

mutagenic potential of PAHs, regulatory standards have been
proposed. Slooff et al. (1989) proposed a maximum permissible
level of 1 ng m3 benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) in the atmosphere. In some
European countries, the maximum allowed is 0.7e1.3 ng m3 of
BaPeq in outdoor air (Omar et al., 2006). In this study, for samples
collected in 2008, BaPeq in PM2.5 ranged from 0.38 to 1.2 ng m3
(NHV season) and 0.62e6.4 ng m3 (HV season); whereas in 2009,
BaPeq ranged from 0.51 to 0.73 ng m3 (NHV season) and
0.20e2.2 ng m3 (HV season). For PM10 (2009) the range was
0.47e1.51 ng m3 (NHV season) and 0.428e2.050 ng m3 (HV).
Considering a limit of 1 ng m3 BaPeq, as recommended by
WHO (Zhang et al., 2009), this threshold was exceeded in 10 of 40
sampling days (25%) during the NHV season, while 30 of 40
sampling days for the HV season (75%) for PM2.5 in 2008/2009.
Therefore the BaP increased ten times from the NHV to the HV
seasons, for PM2.5 and PM10 for both years. Additionally, the BaPeq
levels in the HV season (median of 1.4 ng m3) were similar to that
measured in the city of São Paulo (BaPeq 1.6 ng m3, Bourotti et al.,
2005) and higher than in the city of Rio de Janeiro (BaPeq
0.922 ng m3, Quiterio et al., 2007). Considering that the main PAH
source in urban areas is fossil fuels (gasoline and diesel) in auto-
motive vehicles, and that the number of vehicles in Araraquara
(115,120) is around ten times lower than in São Paulo (6,126,477)
and Rio de Janeiro (1,939,520) (São Paulo, 2010b), the role of
sugarcane burning is still more important.
4. Conclusion
This study indicated that there is a signiﬁcant increase in the-
concentration
of
PAHs
from
the
sugarcane
non-harvest
to
the harvest seasons, which can be represent a public health risk for
the entire population of the city and the surrounding area.
Considering that the maximum permissible BaPeq in ambient air is
1 ng m3, related to the increased cancer risk, our data suggest
a worrying PAH human-exposure scenario in cities that are sur-
rounded by sugarcane ﬁelds where the burning process is used. The
BaPeq in the sugarcane harvest season in Araraquara was higher
than the levels measured in large Brazilian cities. The data indicated
a decrease in the concentration of PAHs between the 2008 and
2009 harvest seasons, probably due to the decreased ﬁeld burning.
It is necessary to drastically reduce or altogether halt the burning of
sugarcane, adopting mechanical-harvesting processes and imple-
menting public policies to redirect cane cutters to other work.

Few studies have focused on the effects of exposure to air pollutants from vegetation ﬁre events (including forest
ﬁre and the burning of crop residues) among children. In this study we aimed to investigate the association be-
tween PM10 concentrations and hospital visits by children to address respiratory disease, conjunctivitis, and der-
matitis. We examined and compared these associations by the presence of vegetation ﬁre events on a given day
(burning, non-burning, and mixed) across the upper northern region of Thailand from 2014 through 2018. A veg-
etation burning was deﬁned when a ﬁre hotspot (obtained from NASA-MODIS) exceeded the 90th percentile of
the entire region and PM10 concentration was over 100 μg/m3. To determine the association between hospital
visits among children with PM10 concentrations on burning and non-burning days, we performed a time-
stratiﬁed case-crossover analysis ﬁtted with conditional logistic regression for each province. A random-effects
meta-analysis was applied to pool province-speciﬁc effect estimates. The number of burning days ranged from
64 to 139 days across eight provinces. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentration on a burning day was associated
with a respiratory disease-related hospital visit at lag 0 (OR = 1.01 (95% CIs: 1.00, 1.02)). This association was not
observed for hospital visits related to conjunctivitis and dermatitis. A positive association was also observed be-
tween PM10 concentration on non-burning days and hospital visits related to respiratory disease at lag 0 (OR =
1.03 (95% CIs: 1.02, 1.04)). Hospital visits for conjunctivitis and dermatitis were signiﬁcantly associated with
PM10 concentration at lag 0 on both non-burning and mixed days.

1. Introduction
In Southeast Asia, vegetation ﬁre events as an agricultural practice as
well as from forest ﬁres causes local and transboundary severe air pollu-
tion events, particularly during the dry season (Chen and Taylor, 2018;
Takami et al., 2020). According to WHO, vegetation ﬁres was referred to
the ﬁre mostly caused by humans, including forest ﬁre and also slash
and burn activities which need the measures to mitigate smoke effects
on population health and to control these events (World Health
Organization, 1998). Vegetation burning can emit massive amounts of
aerosols and trace gases into the atmosphere. The frequency of vegeta-
tion burning activity is highest over Southeast Asia (Streets et al., 2003).
Seasonal haze from vegetation burning primarily affects human
health of the people in Southeast Asian countries, and is particularly
prominent in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand
(Ho et al., 2014).
Smoke from vegetation burning in Thailand, particularly in upper
northern Thailand (UNT), has been of concern as a seasonal severe air
pollution event (Phairuang et al., 2019). Thailand is an agricultural
country and generates large amounts of agricultural residue which is
usually disposed of by burning in open areas (Phairuang et al., 2019).
In addition to agricultural burning, forest ﬁres also contribute signiﬁ-
cantly to air pollution from vegetation burning in UNT (Phairuang
et al., 2019; Sukitpaneenit and Kim Oanh, 2014). The forest ﬁre in the
UNT are often set to collect non-timber forest product, e.g. mushroom
and bamboo shoot (Forest Fire Control Ofﬁce, 2003). The ﬁre season
typically lasts from February to April, when atmospheric conditions
are dry and stagnant (Kim Oanh and Leelasakultum, 2011). In 2013,
the daily peak PM10 concentration in the area was reported to be
428 μg/m3 during this period (Pollution Control Department, 2019). To-
pographical characteristics of UNT exacerbate the problem, as this area
is primarily a mountain-valley, a feature that can enhance the amount of
pollution trapped (Kim Oanh and Leelasakultum, 2011). Other miscella-
neous sources of PM10 in the area include trafﬁc, tobacco curing, and the
brick-making industry (Kim Oanh and Leelasakultum, 2011). Coal
power plants are also located in Lampang province.
Smoke events from vegetative burning are acknowledged as one of
the reasons underlying the high exposure levels to air pollutants
among residents in Asia (Chakrabarti et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2018).
A better understanding of the health effects from air pollution derived
from vegetation burning versus those from urban settings would pro-
vide helpful insight for source-speciﬁc policy-making that targets air
pollution control. Several existing studies have consistently shown
that particulate matter (PM) from wildﬁres is associated with health ef-
fects (Henderson et al., 2011; Reid et al., 2019; Stowell et al., 2019),
while few studies have focused on the health effects of PM from agricul-
tural burning (Gupta, 2019).
Children are more vulnerable to exposure to smoke from burning ac-
tivities because of their underdeveloped respiratory system and higher
breathing rate (Lipsett and Materna, 2008), and respiratory disease
among children is one of the major consequences of vegetation burning.
Previous studies have suggested that smoke from vegetation burning
may increase hospital admission and emergency room visits due to
asthma and acute bronchitis in children (Chen et al., 2006; Paraiso and
Gouveia, 2015). However, such studies have not been conducted
much in Asia (Gupta, 2019). Exposure to smoke from vegetation burn-
ing may also cause irritating symptoms in the eyes, nose, throat, and
skin (Lipsett and Materna, 2008). One study examined how respiratory
and eye symptoms were associated with exposure to wildﬁre smoke in
children (Künzli et al., 2006). Given that direct exposure to pollutants
from smoke induces biological responses in both the eyes and skin,
the burden of these symptoms is not negligible. Despite this, few studies
have focused on eye and skin symptoms. Therefore, quantifying the
health effects of exposure to air pollutants from vegetation burning is
warranted to prevent these consequences, particularly among suscepti-
ble groups.
Assessing exposure to smoke from vegetation burning is challeng-
ing. The most common method is to use PM concentrations from air pol-
lution monitoring (Martin et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2010). However,
assessing only PM concentrations may not necessarily yield an accurate
level of exposure to vegetation burning. High PM concentrations may be
caused not by vegetation burning but by unusual activities near the
monitoring area such as trafﬁc congestion during long holidays. While
air pollution monitoring stations are most often located in urban
areas, where trafﬁc air pollution is the main source of pollution, burning
activities tend to occur outside these areas, farther from monitoring sta-
tions. Satellite-derived ﬁre hotspots have been used for exposure as-
sessment of vegetation burning (Gupta, 2019), and involve the use of
satellite data obtained from different temperatures on the ground
(Chakrabarti et al., 2019). Combining the information from ﬁre hotspots
with PM concentrations might increase the accuracy of ﬁre-related PM
readings. Indeed, the occurrence of vegetation burning measured via
ﬁre hotspots was found to correlate with PM10 concentrations
(Sukitpaneenit and Kim Oanh, 2014). The number of ﬁre hotspots has
been used as a proxy for air pollution in areas without air pollution
monitoring stations (Chakrabarti et al., 2019). Moreover, ﬁre hotspots
not only identify burning events, but can also provide information on
burning intensity, which reﬂects the heat emitted from ﬁre at the burn-
ing area (Elliott et al., 2013).
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of smoke from veg-
etation ﬁre events on health outcomes in children. Speciﬁcally, we eval-
uated the association between PM10 concentrations and the number of
hospital visits to address respiratory, conjunctivitis, and dermatitis in
children under age 15 years. We compared effect estimates on burning,
non-burning, and mixed days across UNT, and used daily PM10 concen-
trations measured during 2014 through 2018 coupled with ﬁre hotspot
data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to
identify burning days.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study area
The study area consisted of eight provinces in UNT, including
Chiangmai, Chiangrai, Lamphun, Lampang, Mae Hong Son, Nan, Phayao,
and Phrea, which are the provinces most affected by smoke from vege-
tation ﬁre events (Phairuang et al., 2017; Pollution Control Department,
2019). Fig. 1 shows the provincial boundaries and locations of the ambi-
ent air monitoring stations. The area of interest spans 93,690 km2 and
borders Myanmar and Laos.
2.2. Hospital visits data
We obtained hospital visit (outpatient visits) data for children under
age 15 years except for new born less than 1 month old within the study
area between January 2014 and December 2018, which were provided
by the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Thailand. The data were col-
lected from 1274 public hospitals belong to MOPH covering eight prov-
inces of UNT area. Data from each hospital visit included demographic
information (age and sex), date of visit, and International Classiﬁcation
of Diseases version 10 (ICD10) codes for diagnosis. We included diagno-
ses of respiratory disease (J00-J99.8), conjunctivitis (H10-H10.9), and
dermatitis (L20−L30). This study was ofﬁcially exempted from ethics
approval by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto University Graduate School
of Engineering because it did not use personal data (No. 201904).
2.3. Air pollution and meteorological data
Hourly concentrations of PM10 (μg/m3), carbon monoxide (CO),
ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were ob-
tained from 14 air monitoring stations (Fig. 1) from the Pollution Con-
trol Department, Thailand. Daily concentrations of each air pollutant

were computed from hourly data. Data on meteorological variables
(ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and rainfall)
measured at 16 meteorological stations were obtained from Meteoro-
logical Department, Thailand. We averaged the value of PM10 and mete-
orological data from the stations within the province.
2.4. Burning day occurrence
In order to identify burning events, ﬁre hotspot data (MCD14ML)
(Giglio et al., 2018) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA) Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capa-
bility for EOS (LANCE) Fire Information for Resource Management Sys-
tem (FIRMS) (NASA, 2018). Fire hotspot data were retrieved from
satellite data obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites.
Hotspots are recorded at a resolution of 1 km when both Terra and
Aqua satellites overlap (occurring globally at 1:30 am, 10:30 am,
1:30 pm, and 10:30 pm) (Jordan et al., 2008). We mapped ﬁre hotspots
using QGIS 3.4 (QGIS Development Team, 2014) and summed the num-
ber of ﬁre hotspots by day and province. The detection of hotspots may
be inﬂuenced by reﬂective surfaces or cloud cover. However, meteoro-
logical conditions during the burning season in UTN are dry with low
wind speed and cloudiness (Kim Oanh and Leelasakultum, 2011).
Hotspot data also included conﬁdence values that indicate the quality
of individual ﬁre pixels determined from the geometric mean of the dif-
ference between background and brightness temperatures in each
channel algorithm (Giglio et al., 2003). In this study, ﬁre hotspots with
a conﬁdence value under 20% (low conﬁdence) were excluded from
the analysis.
As no study have been using ﬁre hotspot data to be a criterion of a
burning day, we deﬁned a ‘burning day’ as a day when the number of
ﬁre hotspots exceeded the 90th percentile of the daily distribution of
the entire region (10 counts) and the daily PM10 concentration in each
province was greater than 100 μg/m3. A day without ﬁre hotspot was
deﬁned as a ‘non-burning day’. The remaining days were classiﬁed as
‘mixed days’. For example, when the cumulative number of ﬁre hotspots
for the entire region (sum up of eight provinces) was 35 counts, and
PM10 was 120 μg/m3 and 75 μg/m3 in Chiangmai and Chiangrai, respec-
tively, we deﬁned this day as a ‘burning day’ in Chiangmai and as a
‘mixed day’ in Chiangrai. Hence, we assumed that increases in PM10
on a burning day was driven by vegetative ﬁre events. The previous
studies found that the major contributed ion in PM were ammonium
and potassium which is a tracer of vegetation burning while sulfate
emitted from fuel combustion also found in this area (Chantara et al.,
2012; Pengchai et al., 2009). The cut-off PM10 concentration was
based on published studies that found that health effects from haze
days developed when PM10 concentrations were higher than 100 μg/
m3 (Sahani et al., 2014). Fig. 2 shows ﬁre hotspots on April 1, 2014
across eight provinces.
2.5. Study design and statistical analysis
We examined the relationship between vegetation burning-derived
PM10 and hospital visits among children using a time-stratiﬁed case-
crossover study design. This analysis is similar to that of a case-control
study, except that each case serves as its own control (Maclure, 1991).
In order to matched case and control, we assigned the day on which a
hospital visits occurred as the case day and comparisons to a control
days chosen on the same day of the week earlier and later in the same
month in the same year (Janes et al., 2005). We used a conditional logis-
tic regression model to estimate the odds ratio for exposure to PM10 on
burning and non-burning days and hospital visits in all health end-
points. We included the natural splines of a 3-day moving average lag
in temperature (Morgan et al., 2010), assuming 3 degrees of freedom
(df). The model with the best ﬁt was selected by the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC). Relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed were
also included. However, relative humidity did not inﬂuence the AIC
value and was omitted from the ﬁnal model. The analysis was con-
ducted for burning, non-burning, and mixed days separately because
we surmised that this association may vary by the type of day. We ex-
amined the association with single lag (lag 0 - lag 3) and average lag
(lag 01- lag 03) for all health outcomes.
A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to obtain pooled ef-
fect estimates of PM10 and hospital visits on burning, non-burning, and
mixed days. We tested whether the effect estimates for burning days are
signiﬁcantly different from those for non-burning and mixed day by cal-
culating the difference of effect estimate, 95% CIs, and P-value (Altman
and Bland, 2003).

A stratiﬁed analysis was carried out to explore the effect modiﬁca-
tion by age using two age groups, i.e. 0–4 year olds (pre-school children)
and 5–14 year olds (school children) at lag 0.
We also conducted sensitivity analyses using alternative criteria of a
burning day. First, we compared the results among the different percen-
tile cut-off point of the ﬁre hotspot (i.e. 75th (1 count), 90th (10 counts),
and 99th (88 counts)). Next, we repeated the analysis using the differ-
ent of PM10 concentration (100 μg/m3 and 120 μg/m3) with ﬁxing the
ﬁre hotspot at 90th percentile.
All statistical analyses were conducted using the package “survival”
(Fox and Carvalho, 2012) and “metafor” (Viechtbauer, 2010) of R (ver-
sion 1.2.1335, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). Results are presented as odd ratios (ORs) with 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) for 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10.
3. Results
Environmental data, including air pollution, temperature, relative
humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and number of ﬁre hotspots,
were obtained from burning, non-burning, and mixed days (Table 1).
Numbers of burning days ranged from 64 days in Lamphun to
139 days in Mae Hong Son over the ﬁve-year study period. Concentra-
tions of PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 were higher on burning days than
on mixed days or non-burning days in all provinces. Mean concentra-
tions of PM10 on burning days ranged from 122.9 μg/m3 in Phrae to
165.1 μg/m3 in Chiangrai. The daily mean temperature was not signiﬁ-
cantly different between burning, non-burning, and mixed days.
In total, 5,641,107 hospital visits due to respiratory disease, conjunc-
tivitis, and dermatitis among children aged <15 years were recorded
during the study period (Table 2). Study participants included more
pre-school children (age 0–4 years) than school-aged children (age
5–14 years). Among the three reported health conditions, respiratory
disease was responsible for the most hospital visits among children.
PM10 was associated with hospital visits due to respiratory disease
on both burning and non-burning days while its associations with con-
junctivitis and dermatitis were found on non-burning and mixed days
(Fig. 3). Signiﬁcantly positive associations between PM10 and hospital
respiratory diseases on burning days were observed with lag 0, lag 1,
lag 01, and lag 02. The pooled estimate was high on the day of exposure,
with an OR of 1.01 (95% CIs: 1.00, 1.02) (Table S1). Positive associations
between PM10 concentration and hospital visits due to respiratory dis-
ease in children were found in all provinces except Chiangrai (Table S1).
Positive associations were also found between hospital visits for all
health outcomes and PM10 concentrations on non-burning days. On
mixed days, hospital visits for conjunctivitis and dermatitis were associ-
ated with PM10 concentrations. Pooled risks for non-burning days were
1.03 (95% CIs: 1.02, 1.04 (lag 0)) for respiratory disease, 1.04 (95% CIs:
1.03, 1.05 (lag 0)) for dermatitis, and 1.02 (95% CIs: 1.00, 1.03 (lag
02)) for conjunctivitis (Table S1). For mixed days, a high estimated
risk was found with lag 0 for conjunctivitis (OR = 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.00,
1.02) and dermatitis (OR = 1.01, 95% CIs: 1.01, 1.02) (Table S1). The
comparison of non-burning/mixed days with burning days showed
that the estimated effect of PM10 on respiratory disease on burning
days was slightly but signiﬁcantly lower when compared with non-
burning days at lag 0 (Fig. 3).
We further examined the association at lag 0 stratiﬁed by two sub-
groups of the children (pre-school and school children) which is pre-
sented in the Fig. 4. We found that ORs for school children (5–14 year
olds) were slightly higher than pre-school children (0–4 year olds) on
both burning and non-burning day although there was no signiﬁcant
difference in ORs between the two age groups.
Sensitivity analyses were performed by comparing the effect esti-
mate of the different cut-off points for ﬁre hotspot and PM10 concentra-
tion. Applying different cut-off point of ﬁre hotspot (Fig. 5) and PM10
concentration (Fig. 6) generally showed similar effect estimates.
4. Discussion
This study investigated the association between hospital visits by
children and exposure to PM10 on vegetation burning days. The study
also compared the effect estimates on burning days with those on
non-burning and mixed days. Across UNT, PM10 concentrations differed
signiﬁcantly between burning, non-burning, and mixed days. PM10 con-
centrations on burning days were generally higher than those on other

days, with daily mean concentrations above the Thailand air quality
standards for PM10 (120 μg/m3). A signiﬁcant association between
PM10 and hospital visits due to respiratory disease were observed on
both burning and non-burning days while its associations with conjunc-
tivitis and dermatitis were found on non-burning and mixed days. The
effect estimates were highest at lag 0 for those signiﬁcant associations.
These ﬁnding indicates an acute effect.
We found that PM10 concentrations on burning days signiﬁcantly in-
ﬂuenced the number of hospital visits for respiratory disease. This ﬁnd-
ing is consistent with previous vegetation-derived particulate studies
(Henderson et al., 2011; Stowell et al., 2019). Speciﬁcally, various
acute respiratory outcomes were observed in children during burning
events and included asthma (Henderson et al., 2011; Stowell et al.,
2019), upper respiratory inﬂammation (Künzli et al., 2006), lower re-
spiratory inﬂammation (Mirabelli et al., 2009), and respiratory mortal-
ity (Sahani et al., 2014). However, we found an inverse association in
Chiangrai province. This may be due to the effectiveness after burning
ban policy has been implemented (Yabueng et al., 2020) or implemen-
tation of the preventive activities e.g. establishment of safety zone, and
school closure in the province during burning day. This inverse associa-
tion could also be by chance. Children are more susceptible to respira-
tory issues because their lungs are less developed and they have
higher respiratory rates than adults. Thus, the effects of vegetation
burning-derived PM are most evident in their respiratory system; in
some cases, systemic damage in the lung may be sustained (World
Health Organization, 2005). It is possible that the different patterns of
activities and the duration of time spent in outdoor may contribute to
variation in susceptibility to PM effects among different age groups.
However, the effect estimates of preschool children and school children
in this study were not different.
Although we found signiﬁcant associations between vegetation
burning-related PM and the number of hospital visits for respiratory

disease, similar associations were not observed consistently for con-
junctivitis and dermatitis. Few studies have focused on how
vegetation-derived particulates inﬂuence conjunctivitis and dermatitis.
One previous study found an increased likelihood of doctor visits to ad-
dress eye irritation when wildﬁre-derived PM concentrations were high
(Künzli et al., 2006). Another study reported clinical cases of eye com-
plaints and dermatitis during a haze period in Singapore (Yeo et al.,
2014). The discrepancy between our results and those of previous stud-
ies may be attributed to differences in the severity of the disease (e.g.
complaint data, eye symptoms reported by school, or hospital visits
data). In the present study, only a few of those who had symptoms
may have visited the hospital during the burning period.
Vegetation burning-derived particles contained high levels of potas-
sium, organic carbon, black carbon, and speciﬁc components such as
methoxyphenol, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and
levoglucosan (Naeher et al., 2007). We hypothesized that the effects
of PM10 on burning days would be more prominent than those on
non-burning and mixed days. However, we found a slightly higher ef-
fect estimate for respiratory diseases of non-burning day compared to
burning day at the immediate lag. A previous study conducted in
Australia estimated an increased risk of approximately 1% in the num-
ber of respiratory illness-related hospital admissions for every 10 μg/
m3 increase in bushﬁre and urban PM10 (Morgan et al., 2010). In an-
other study, multi-exposure metrics for PM documented a similar in-
crease in risk of respiratory illness-related hospitalization and PM
from smoke and non-smoke days (Deﬂorio-Barker et al., 2019). Specif-
ically, that study found a higher likelihood for asthma-related hospital-
izations on smoke days. Our result was inconsistent with the previous
studies. One potential reason can be attributed to difference in the tox-
icity of PM components derived from different sources. It is possible that
PM during non-burning days may have contained more toxic compo-
nents in this study. A toxicological study also found that vegetation-

derived PM reduced cell viability and IL-8 induction, while urban-
derived PM increased pro-inﬂammatory and mutagenic activity
(Heuvel et al., 2018). These ﬁndings collectively suggest that both veg-
etation burning and urban sources can trigger respiratory incidents in
children.
In addition, higher numbers of hospital visits for conjunctivitis and
dermatitis were observed on non-burning and mixed days. In this
study, burning day corresponded to a day when the number of ﬁre
hotspots exceeded the 90th percentile of the daily distribution of the
entire region and PM10 concentration in each province was greater
than 100 μg/m3, whereas a non-burning day was the day without ﬁre
hotspot detection. Main sources of PM on non-burning and mixed
days include urban sources e.g. trafﬁc and some burning activities
such as waste burning. Associations between PM10 concentrations
from urban sources (non-burning days) and hospital visits for dermati-
tis in children in the present study are similar to those reported in a pre-
vious study (Kim et al., 2017). Children are more susceptible to
dermatitis given their immature skin barrier function, and thus are in
a vulnerable developmental stage (Ahn, 2014). We also observed posi-
tive associations between the number of hospital visits for conjunctivitis
and dermatitis and PM concentrations on mixed days, but not on burn-
ing days. This may be due to the fact that people likely spent more time
outside on non-burning days; typically, they are cautioned to stay in-
doors on burning days (Moran et al., 2019). In California, for example,
children are more likely to take preventive actions such as staying in-
doors during the wildﬁre season (Künzli et al., 2006).
Our study has several strengths. First, we conducted a multi-
province analysis, which provides a representative overview of associa-
tions between various health outcomes and air pollution levels during a
burning event in Southeast Asia. Second, we examined associations be-
tween the number of hospital visits and exposure to PM10, speciﬁcally
focusing on burning days using satellite data coupled with PM concen-
trations, whereas some previous studies used only PM concentrations
(Martin et al., 2013) or limited the study period to burning seasons
which might lead to misclassiﬁcation of burning day (Gupta, 2019).
Third, we compared effect estimates of PM10 on burning, non-burning,
and mixed days in the same population, rather than in different popula-
tions. Finally, we examined the health effects of vegetation ﬁre events
among children, and was thus one of the ﬁrst to address the question
in this susceptible population (Gupta, 2019; Sahani et al., 2014).
A few limitations are worth noting. We used PM10 concentrations
from ground monitoring to reﬂect exposure, which may have been sub-
ject to misclassiﬁcation, and may not accurately represent an individu-
al's exposure. While our results offer insight into the health effects of
vegetation burning, generalizing these ﬁndings to other regions may re-
quire further research, since conditions relating to fuel type, meteorol-
ogy, and topography can all inﬂuence the characteristics of PM
(composition, size, and concentration) and impact health outcomes.
An additional limitation might be misclassiﬁcation of a burning day.
First, smoldering ﬁres sometimes cannot be detected from satellite ob-
servation even when they emit substantial smoke which can lead to
high level of PM concentration. Second, valley topography of UNT
might have affected the spatial distribution of PM10 and could cause
misclassiﬁcation of burning day.
5. Conclusion
We found that PM10 on burning days was signiﬁcantly associated
with the number of hospital visits among children due to respiratory
disease, but not conjunctivitis or dermatitis. Effect estimates of PM10
on hospital visits for respiratory diseases was lower on burning than
non-burning days. The associations observed were generally acute, oc-
curring within the ﬁrst two days.

Exosomal circRNA_100284 from arsenite-
transformed cells, via microRNA-217
regulation of EZH2, is involved in the
malignant transformation of human
hepatic cells by accelerating the cell cycle
and promoting cell proliferation

Abstract
Intercellular communication between malignant cells and neighboring nonmalignant cells is involved in
carcinogenesis. In the progression of carcinogenesis, exosomes are messengers for intercellular communication.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with functions that include regulation of the cell cycle and proliferation.
However, the functions of exosomal circRNAs are not clear. The present research aimed to determine whether
circRNAs secreted from arsenite-transformed human hepatic epithelial (L-02) cells are transferred into normal L-02 cells
and become functionally active in the normal cells. The results showed that circRNA_100284 is involved in the
malignant transformation of L-02 cells induced by arsenite. The medium from transformed L-02 cells induced
upregulation of circRNA_100284, accelerated the cell cycle, and promoted proliferation of normal L-02 cells.
Transformed cells transferred circRNA_100284 into normal L-02 cells via exosomes and led to the malignant
transformation of the non-transformed cells. Knockdown of circRNA_100284, which reduced circRNA_100284 levels in
exosomes derived from transformed L-02 cells, blocked the accelerated cell cycle and reduced proliferation and
malignancy. In addition, in normal L-02 cells, exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells
induced acceleration of the cell cycle and promoted proliferation via acting as a sponge of microRNA-217. Further,
exosomal circRNA_100284 was upregulated in the sera of people exposed to arsenite. Thus, exosomes derived from
transformed L-02 cells transferred circRNA_100284 to surrounding cells, which induced an accelerated cell cycle and
promoted proliferation of normal liver cells and led to the malignant transformation of the non-transformed cells. The
ﬁndings support the concept that exosomal circRNAs are involved in cell–cell communication during carcinogenesis
induced by arsenite.

arsenic is associated with lung, bladder, and skin cancer,
and with noncancerous disorders such as cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, and skin lesions1,2. Carcinogenesis
induced by arsenic is related to genetic variants3,4, oxi-
dative DNA damage5, and DNA methylation6. Inorganic
arsenic affects various signaling pathways7 and stimulates
cell proliferation by increasing the population of cells in
the S phase of the cell cycle8. However, the molecular
mechanisms remain unclear.
Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are not translated into
protein. Abundant
and functionally
active
types
of
noncoding RNAs include transfer RNAs (tRNAs), ribo-
somal RNAs (rRNAs), small RNAs such as microRNAs
(miRNAs), and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs). Chronic expo-
sure to arsenite causes abnormal expression of various
ncRNAs, including miR-21;9 miR-143;10 and the lncRNA
MALAT111.
Circular RNA (circRNA), unlike the better-known
linear RNA, has a covalently closed, continuous loop,
with the 3’ and 5’ ends joined together. For humans,
thousands of circRNAs have been identiﬁed by use of p
(A)-without RNase R RNA-seq data12. Several circRNAs
serve as biomarkers in the development of hepatocellular
carcinomas and regulate gene expression by acting as
“miRNA sponges”13,14. By use of a circRNA microarray,
we
found,
in
a
previous
study,
that,
in
arsenite-
transformed HaCaT cells, circRNA_100284 showed the
greatest upregulation and was involved in the arsenite-
accelerated cell cycle of human keratinocytes in the pro-
cess of carcinogenesis15.
In the tumor microenvironment, crosstalk of malignant
cells with nonmalignant cells is essential for tumor pro-
gression16. Exosomes, with diameters of 30–100 nm, are
cell-derived vesicles that are present in many, and perhaps
all, eukaryotic ﬂuids, including blood, and urine, and in
the culture medium of cells17,18. Exosomes carry mes-
senger RNAs (mRNAs), miRNAs19, and double-stranded
DNA20. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell signaling
and may inﬂuence processes in normal cells because they
can merge with and release their contents into cells that
are distant from their cell of origin. For example, as shown
in our previous studies, RNAs shuttled from one cell to
another, known as “exosomal shuttle RNAs,” can affect
protein production in normal cells21,22. In exosomes,
circRNAs are enriched and stable23, and, in KRAS mutant
colon cancer cells, circRNAs can be transferred into
exosomes24. However, the functions of exosomal cir-
cRNAs remain undeﬁned.
In the present study, we investigated the inﬂuence of
arsenic-transformed L-02 cells on the cell cycle and cell
proliferation of normal liver cells. Chronic exposure to
arsenite elevated circRNA_100284 levels, which were
involved in the malignant transformation of normal L-02
cells.
circRNA_100284
was
contained
in
exosomes
released by transformed cells and could be transferred
into normal cells, and exosomal circRNA_100284 regu-
lated the cell cycle and stimulated cell proliferation
of normal liver cells by interacting with miRNA-217
(miR-217). These ﬁndings contribute to an understanding
of the processes involved in carcinogenesis caused by
arsenite.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and reagents
L-02 cells, a line of normal human liver cells, were
obtained from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and were
maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life
Technologies/Gibco, Grand Island, NY), 100 U/mL peni-
cillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Life Technologies/
Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD). We previously established the
model of arsenite-transformed L-02 cells25. For chronic
exposure, 1 × 106 L-02 cells were seeded into 10-cm
(diameter) dishes for 24 h and maintained in 0 or 2 μM
sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, Sigma, St. Louis, MO; purity,
99.0%) for 48–72 h per passage. This process was con-
tinued for ~15 weeks (30 passages).
Nude mouse tumorigenicity assay
Female athymic nude mice (5 weeks old) were pur-
chased from the Animal Research Center of Nanjing
University (China) and housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free
room in the Animal Facility at the Nanjing Medical
University. Animals were treated humanely and with
regard for alleviation of suffering according to a protocol
approved by the Nanjing Medical University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse xenograft assays
were performed as described previously26. Brieﬂy, 1 × 107
cells were injected subcutaneously into the right armpits
of nude mice. There were six mice per group. Tumor
incidence and size were monitored once per week.
After 4 weeks, tumor tissues were removed. Tumor
volume
was
calculated
by
the
modiﬁed
ellipsoid
formula:27 tumor volume (mm3) = 1/2 (xy2), where x is
the greatest longitudinal diameter and y is greatest
transverse diameter.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total cellular RNA was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. To
detect circRNAs and miRNAs, 2 μg of total RNA and
HiScript II Q Select RT Supermix (Vazyme Biotech) were
used in reverse transcription according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol. For detection of circRNA_100284,
GAPDH RNA was used as a control. Forward (F) and
reverse (R) primers, synthesized by Invitrogen, were as
follows: circRNA_100284-F: 5’-ACTCACAATGATCCAA

SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and a Roche LightCycler96 machine.
Fold changes in expression of each gene were calculated
by a comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method using the
formula 2−(ΔΔCt)28.
Western blots
Cell lysates were prepared with a detergent buffer as
described
previously25.
Protein
concentrations
were
measured with the BCA Protein Assay according to the
manufacturer’s
manual
(Beyotime
Institute
of
Bio-
technology, Shanghai, China). Equal amounts (80 μg) of
protein were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were transferred
to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (PVDF, Millipore,
Billerica, MA). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4
°C with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-tubulin (Abcam) and
antibodies for EZH2 or cyclin-D1 (Cell Signaling Tech-
nology, Beverly, MA). After additional incubation with a
1:1000 dilution of an anti-immunoglobin horseradish
peroxidase-linked antibody for 1 h, the immune com-
plexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Cell Signaling Technology). For densitometric analyses,
protein bands on the blots were measured by the use of
Image J software.
Exosome isolation
The culture medium was collected and centrifuged at
3000×g for 15 min, and the supernatant was ﬁltered
through
a
0.22-mm
PVDF
ﬁlter
(Millipore).
An
appropriate volume of Exoquick exosome precipitation
solution (System Biosciences) was added to the ﬁltered
culture medium, or a quarter volume of Exoquick
exosome
precipitation
solution
was
added
to
the
serum. After mixing and refrigeration for 24 h, the mix-
ture was centrifuged at 1500×g for 30 min, and the
supernatant was removed. Exosome pellets from 1 × 106
cells were suspended in 150 µL of serum-free medium.
The size distribution and concentration of exosomes
were analyzed by nanoparticle-tracking analysis using
a
ZetaView
particle
tracker
from
ParticleMetrix
(Germany).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
The exosome-enriched pellets were suspended in 50 mL
of PBS, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% glutar-
aldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at incubation
temperature and kept at 4 °C until analysis by TEM. A
drop of each exosome sample was placed on a carbon-
coated copper grid and immersed in 2% phosphotungstic
acid solution (pH 7.0) for 30 s. The preparations were
examined
with
a
transmission
electron
microscope
(JEM-1200EX; JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an acceleration
voltage of 80 kV.
Exosome labeling
Exosomes from 1.5 × 106 cells were suspended in 180 μL
of PBS with 20 μL of 1:50 diluted PKH67 (Sigma, in
Diluent C). After 3 min of incubation at room tempera-
ture (RT), 3.8 mL of exosome-free medium was added
to terminate the labeling reaction, and exosomes were
harvested and washed twice with PBS by centrifugation
(100,000 g for 1 h). Exosomes were suspended in 9.6 mL
of basal medium, and 250 μL was added to a sub-
conﬂuent layer of L-02 or T-L-02 cells, which were
incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with
PBS and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30
min at RT. To stain the nuclei, 4′,6-diamidino-2-pheny-
lindole (DAPI, Sigma) was added for 10 min, and stained
cells were observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope
(Zeiss, LSM700B, Germany).
Cell transfection
An miR-217 mimic, an miR-217 inhibitor, an miRNA
negative control mimic (con mimic), an miRNA negative
control inhibitor (con inhibitor), a circRNA_10084 siRNA
and a control siRNA were synthesized by RiBoBio
(Guangzhou, China). A pLCDH- circRNA_10084, and a
pLCDH
control
were
synthesized
by
GENESEED
(Guangzhou, China). Cells were transiently transfected by
use of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h after transfection,
cells were harvested and used for experiments.
Flow cytometry
L-02 cells were treated with culture medium or exo-
somes isolated from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells that
were transfected with circRNA_100284 siRNA or control
siRNA, and an miR-217 inhibitor or control inhibitor for
24 h, and the cells were harvested after 24 h. After
washing twice with cold PBS, cells were ﬁxed with 75%
ethanol at 4 °C overnight and again washed twice with
cold PBS. After treatment with RNase A at 37 °C for 30
min and staining with propidium iodide, 105 nuclei were
examined with a FACS Calibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, USA). The results were presented as the
percentages of cells in each phase.
Determination of cell proliferation
Cell proliferation was evaluated by WST-8 hydrolysis
using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technol-
ogies,
Inc.)
as
described
previously29.
Brieﬂy,
cells
were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at 4000 cells
per well. Plates were incubated for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 h
Dai et al. Cell Death and Disease  (2018) 9:454

Ofﬁcial journal of the Cell Death Differentiation Association
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidiﬁed incubator.
After cells were treated and after incubation, 20 μL of
WST-8 was added to each well and the incubation con-
tinued for an additional 3 h. Plates were read on a Biorad
ELISA plate reader (BioTEK Instruments, Winooski, VT,
USA) using a 450-nm ﬁlter. Results of at least three
independent experiments were analyzed in duplicate. The
relative cell proliferation ratios were plotted along with
non-treated controls to determine the 100% level of
activity.
Anchorage-independent growth
Soft agar dishes were prepared with under layers of
0.70% agarose in 1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS. To test their capacity for colony growth in soft agar,
treated L-02 cells were plated in triplicate at a density of
1 × 104 in 2 mL of 0.35% agarose over the agar base.
Cultures were fed every 3 days. After ~14 days, the
colonies were observed under a microscope, and those
with diameters >80 μm were counted. These represent
colonies with >30 cells.
Transwell assays
Migration of arsenite-transformed L-02 cells was eval-
uated by use of Transwell chambers with 8-μm pore ﬁlters
(Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). At 24 h after trans-
fection, cells (5 × 104/100 μL) were plated on the upper
chambers in serum-free medium; 1640 medium contain-
ing 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers as a che-
moattractant. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, non-
migrating cells were removed with cotton swabs. Cells
that migrated to the bottom of the membrane were ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet
solution for 30 min, and washed twice with PBS. Stained
cells were visualized under a microscope (high-power
ﬁeld), and the numbers of cells counted in ﬁve random
ﬁelds were averaged. To assess the capacity for invasion of
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells, transfected cells (5 × 104/
100 μL) were added to upper chambers that had been
coated with 35 μL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA); 1640 medium containing 10% FBS was
added to the lower chambers. Cells were incubated for 24
h at 37 °C, and non-invading cells were removed with
cotton swabs. Invading cells were ﬁxed, stained, and
counted.
Statistical analyses
Derived values are presented as means ± SD. Compar-
isons of means among multiple groups were performed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and a multiple-
range least signiﬁcant difference was used for intergroup
comparisons. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were performed with
SPSS 16.0.
Results
Effects of circRNA_100284 on the neoplastic capacity of
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells
To investigate whether circRNA_100284 was associated
with arsenite-induced malignant transformation of liver
epithelial cells, L-02 cells were treated with 0 or 2 μM of
arsenite for 0, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. Real-time PCR revealed
that levels of circRNA_100284 were increased by arsenite
in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, L-02
cells were exposed to 0 or 2 μM of arsenite for 0, 10, 20, or
30 passages. With longer times of exposure to arsenite,
the levels of circRNA_100284 showed a rising trend,
which was not obvious for control cells (Fig. 1b). To
establish whether L-02 cells were transformed after long
exposures to arsenite, the anchorage-independent growth
capacity of arsenite-transformed L-02 cells was assessed.
L-02 cells formed colonies in agar after exposure to 2 μM
arsenite for 30 passages; control cells did not show this
capacity (Figs. 1c,d). Moreover, the tumor incidence in the
group of mice injected with arsenite-transformed L-02
cells was 100% (6/6 per group); for the control group, the
incidence was 0% (0/6). The tumor volumes for the group
implanted with arsenite-transformed cells were deter-
mined (Figs. 1e,f). These results indicate that exposure to
arsenite induces the malignant transformation of normal
liver cells, accompanied with the overexpression of
circRNA_100284.
Since circRNA_100284 was upregulated in arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells, the inﬂuence of circRNA_100284
on arsenite-induced malignancy was examined. We ﬁrst
targeted
circRNA_100284
using
siRNAs
speciﬁcally
against the back-splice junction of circRNA_100284.
Three siRNAs were designed for screening. The proper
siRNA should have the capacity to knock down the
circRNA_100284 without affecting the levels of its
linear isoform, GCLM mRNA. siRNA#3 matched these
criteria (Figs. S1A and S1B) and was used in further
research.
Determined
by
qRT-PCR,
the
level
of
circRNA_100284
decreased
after
transfecting
cells
with siRNA compared with that in arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells (Fig. 1g). There was only a slight recovery in
circRNA_100284 expression (Fig. S1C). After 14 days of
incubation
under
anchorage-independent
conditions,
arsenite-transformed
L-02
cells
transfected
with
circRNA_100284 siRNA formed fewer colonies in agar
than those transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 1h, upper,
and Fig. 1i). In addition, silencing of circRNA_100284 in
arsenite-transformed cells inhibited cell invasion and
migration (Fig. 1h, lower, and Fig. 1j). Moreover, to
investigate the malignancy of L-02 cells that had been
exposed to 2 μM arsenite for 20 passages (As-L-02-p20
cells), a test for soft agar colony formation and a xenograft
study were performed. Since the results showed no
differences in numbers of colonies (Fig. S2A and Fig. S2B)
Dai et al. Cell Death and Disease  (2018) 9:454

or sizes of tumors (Fig. S2C and Fig. S2D) compared to
the passage-control normal L-02 cells, the As-L-02-p20
cells could be considered as non-transformed cells.
Moreover, we overexpressed circRNA_100284 in the
As-L-02-p20 cells. qRT-PCR showed that the expression
of circRNA_100284 was upregulated after transfection
with pLCDH- circRNA_100284 (Fig. S2E). As-L-02-p20
cells transfected with pLCDH- circRNA_100284 formed
more colonies in agar than those transfected with the
pLCDH control (Fig. S2F, upper, and Fig. S2G). In
addition,
overexpression
of
circRNA_100284
led
to
enhanced invasion and migration (Fig. S2F, lower, and
Fig. S2H). Thus, circRNA_100284 is involved in the
neoplastic
and
metastatic
capacity
of
arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells.
Medium from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells induces
circRNA_100284 upregulation, acceleration of the cell
cycle, and proliferation of normal L-02 cells
Interactions between cancer cells and neighboring cells
in the extracellular environment are involved in the pro-
gression of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and
promote cancer development and metastasis30,31, we
presumed that circRNA_100284 levels in normal cells
were affected by transformed cells through intercellular
communication. To prove this hypothesis, normal L-02
cells were exposed to basal medium, medium from
passage-control L-02 cells, or medium from arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells for 24 h. The levels of cir-
cRNA_100284 in normal L-02 cells were elevated when
they were exposed to medium from arsenite-transformed

L-02 cells relative to the basal medium or medium from
passage-control L-02 cells (Fig. 2a).
Deregulated cell proliferation resulting from altered cell
cycle progression is a main event in malignant and neo-
plastic transformation32. Elevated expression of enhancer
of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) in cell lines regulates the cell
cycle via cyclin-D1 and increases proliferation and onco-
genic capacity33,34. The levels of EZH2 and cyclin-D1 in
normal L-02 cells treated with various media were mea-
sured. Normal L-02 cells treated with medium from
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells showed elevated levels of
EZH2 and cyclin-D1 (Figs. 2b,c). In addition, ﬂow cyto-
metry showed that the cell cycle was accelerated in cells
treated with the medium from arsenite-transformed L-02
cells, as determined by the accelerated G1/S transition
(Figs. 2d,e). Furthermore, the medium from arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells promoted the growth of normal
cells at multiple time points (24, 48, 72, and 96 h) relative
to the growth of cells treated with basal medium (Fig. 2f).
These results showed that, for normal liver cells, medium
from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells induced increases of
circRNA_100284 levels, an accelerated cell cycle, and
abnormal cell proliferation.
Exosomes derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells are
transferred into normal L-02 cells and induced increases of
circRNA_100284 in normal L-02 cells
Exosomes, membrane-bound vessels that are released
from cells, contain cargo including proteins, lipids, and
RNA19. Thus, we predicted that circRNA_100284 is
transferred from transformed cells into neighboring nor-
mal cells via exosomes. To establish the functions of
exosomes, exosomal fractions were prepared from the
culture media of passage-control L-02 cells and arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells. Electron microscopy revealed that
the exosomes of passage-control L-02 cells and arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells showed typically rounded shapes
(Fig. 3a). The particle sizes and counts of the exosomes
showed no signiﬁcant differences between exosomes
derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells and passage-
control L-02 cells as determined by a ZetaView® nano-
particle tracker (Fig. 3b). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed
the presence of exosome marker proteins CD81 and
CD935 in exosomes derived from arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells and passage-control L-02 cells (Fig. 3c). The
levels of circRNA_100284 were higher in exosomes from
arsenite-transformed cells (Fig. 3d). Exosomes derived

determined in L-02 cells. d Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the cell cycle, and (e) representative histograms were prepared. f Proliferation

from passage-control L-02 cells or arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells were labeled with a green ﬂuorescent dye,
PKH67. After 3 h of incubation with labeled exosomes,
normal L-02 cells showed the intake of exosomes in the
cytoplasm, as determined by ﬂuorescence microscopy
(Fig. 3e). Thus, the data show transfer of circRNA_100284
derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells into normal
liver cells via exosomes.
Exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells is involved in acceleration of the cell
cycle in normal L-02 cells
To
investigate
the
function
of

cRNA_100284, normal L-02 cells were exposed to exo-
somes
derived
from

The
levels
of

cRNA_100284 in cells treated with exosomes from

cells treated with exosomes from passage-control L-02
cells
(Fig.
4a).
Exosomes
derived
from
arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells also accelerated the cell cycle
(Figs. 4b, c) and promoted the proliferation at multiple
time points (24, 48, 72, and 96 h) of normal L-02 cells
(Fig. 4d). Exposure of L-02 cells to 0, 10, 20, 50, or 100 μg/
mL of exosomes from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells for
24 h, but not from passage-control cells, induced increa-
ses of EZH2 and cyclin-D1 (Figs. 4e–h). Further, we used
GW4869, which inhibits the secretion of exosomes36.
Arsenite-transformed
L-02
cells
were
treated
with
GW4869 (2.5 mM) or DMSO (0.005%) for 3 h. After
exposure of arsenite-transformed L-02 cells to GW4869,
the generation of exosomes was attenuated. Blocking of
exosomes derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells
inhibited the expression of circRNA_100284 (Fig. S3A),

In view of the ﬁndings described above, we presumed
that exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-

circRNA_100284 in normal L-02 cells were reduced by
exosomes from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells trans-
fected with circRNA_100284 siRNA (Fig. 4i). Knockdown
of circRNA_100284 blocked the increases of protein levels
of EZH2 and cyclin-D1 induced by exosomes from
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells (Figs. 4j,k). Moreover,
ﬂow cytometry showed that the accelerated G1/S transi-
tion induced by exosomes from arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells was reduced after exposure to exosomes from
arsenite-transformed
L-02
cells
transfected
with
circRNA_100284 siRNA (Figs. 4l,m). Thus, in normal
L-02 cells, exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells is involved in increases of
EZH2 and cyclin-D1 and in an abnormal cell cycle.
Exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells induces the acceleration of the cell
cycle and promoted proliferation via miR-217 in normal
L-02 cells
circRNAs usually regulate gene expression by acting as
miRNA sponges37. Since, in a previous study, we found
that, in HaCaT cells, circRNA_100284 is involved in the
arsenite-promoted cell cycle via miR-21715, we predicted
that the pathway was also involved in the abnormal cell
cycle of L-02 cells induced by exosomes from arsenite-
transformed
L-02
cells.
Binding
sites
between
cir-
cRNA_100284 and miR-217 (Fig. 5a) were analyzed by the
bioinformatics methods, circBase (http://circrna.org/) and
CircInteractome
(http://circinteractome.nia.nih.gov/).
Normal L-02 cells were transfected with a control or an
miR-217 mimic and then exposed to exosomes derived
from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells. Overexpression of
miR-217 attenuated the upregulation of EZH2 and cyclin-
D1
induced
by
exosomes
derived
from
arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells (Figs. 5b,c). Next, normal L-02
cells were transfected with a control or an miR-217
inhibitor and then exposed to exosomes derived from
arsenite-transformed L-02 cells transfected with or with-
out
circRNA_100284
siRNA.
Western blot analyses
revealed that the miR-217 inhibitor reversed the effects of
exosomes from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells trans-
fected with circRNA_100284 siRNA on the levels of
EZH2 and cyclin-D1 in normal L-02 cells (Fig. 5d). In
addition, ﬂow cytometry showed that the inhibited
G1/S transition induced in normal L-02 cells by exosomes
from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells transfected with
circRNA_100284 siRNA was also restored by an miR-217
inhibitor (Figs. 5e,f). Moreover, exosomes derived from
cells transfected with circRNA_100284 siRNA inhibited
proliferation of normal L-02 cells at multiple time points
(24, 48, 72, and 96 h), but this effect was reversed by an
miR-217 inhibitor (Fig. 5g). To conclude, in normal liver
cells, exosomal cicrRNA_100284 accelerates the cell cycle
and promotes cell proliferation via miR-217.
Exosomal circRNA_100284 derived from arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells is involved in the malignant
transformation of non-transformed L-02 cell
To
determine
whether
exosomal
circRNA_100284
derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells was involved
in the malignant transformation of non-transformed L-02
cells, we treated As-L-02-p20 cells with exosomes derived
from normal L-02 cells or arsenite-transformed L-02 cells
transfected with or without circRNA_100284 siRNA.
Anchorage-independent growth showed that As-L-02-
p20 cells treated with exosomes derived from arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells formed numerous colonies, but
those treated with exosomes derived from arsenite-
transformed
L-02
transfected
with
circRNA_100284
formed only a few colonies, and these were of small size
(Fig. 6a, upper, and Fig. 6b). To determine whether exo-
somal circRNA_100284 facilitated migration and invasion
of L-02 cells, invasion through Matrigel and migration
through Transwells were evaluated. Relative to controls,
inhibition of exosomal circRNA_100284 impeded the
enhanced invasion and migration of L-02 cells treated
with exosomes derived from arsenite-transformed L-02
cells (Fig. 6a, lower, and Fig. 6c). Moreover, As-L-02-p20
cells treated with circRNA_100284-knockdown exosomes
derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells were injec-
ted
into
nude
mice.
Inhibition
of
exosomal
cir-
cRNA_100284
decreased
the
sizes
of
tumors
that
developed relative to the group treated with exosomes
from arsenite-transformed cells (Figs. 6d, 6e). These
results conﬁrmed that exosomal circRNA_100284 derived
from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells was involved in the
malignant transformation of non-transformed L-02 cells.
Levels of circulating exosomal circRNA_100284 are
overexpressed in people exposed to arsenite
Exosomes are considered as biomarkers of diseases
owning to their capacity of transferring their cargo RNA
molecules, such as mRNAs, miRNAs19, and circRNAs24.
To determine whether circRNA_100284 was involved in
the response to arsenite exposure, exosomes were isolated
from the sera of people exposed or not exposed to
arsenite. Electron microscopic examination showed that
puriﬁed exosomes presented a size distribution consistent
with exosome vesicles (30–100 nm, Fig. 7a). There was
higher expression of exosomal circRNA_100284 in the
sera of people exposed to arsenite compared with that in
sera of paired healthy volunteers (Fig. 7b). These results
indicated that exosomal circRNA_100284 can be used as a
biomarker of arsenite exposure.
Discussion
circRNAs are noncoding RNAs that are widespread and
diverse in eukaryotic cells. Compared with linear RNA,
circRNAs have noncanonical splicing without a free 3’ or

5’ end38. The functions of circRNAs in various cancers
are being elucidated. For example, Hsa_circ_0001649
and hsa_circ_0005075 are potential diagnostic biomarkers
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In our previous
study,
we
found,
by
a
circRNA
microarray,
that
circRNA_100284 showed the greatest upregulation in
arsenite-transformed HaCaT cells and that, in human
keratinocytes, it was involved in the accelerated cell cycle
induced by arsenite in the process of carcinogenesis15. In
the present study, we found that, in normal L-02 cells,
circRNA_100284 was upregulated after both acute and
chronic exposure to arsenite.
Long-term exposure to low concentrations of arsenite
contributes to the malignant transformation of various
cell lines25,39,40. In the present study, L-02 cells were
continuously exposed to 2 μM arsenite for 30 passages.
Low concentrations of arsenite enhanced neoplastic
transformation of cells, as determined by anchorage-

independent growth in soft agar and tumorigenesis in
nude mice. However, inhibition of circRNA_100284 led to
fewer colonies, less invasion, and less migration compared
to control arsenite-transformed L-02 cells; overexpression
of circRNA_100284 in non-transformed cells showed
the opposite results. These results indicate that cir-
cRNA_100284 is involved in the malignant transforma-
tion induced by arsenite in normal epithelial cells.
In the tumor microenvironment, complex mechanisms
are involved in tumor progression, particularly in inter-
cellular communication between malignant cells and
nonmalignant cells41. In our previous study, we found
that the medium from transformed HBE cells affects
physiological and pathological processes in normal HBE
cells22,42. On the basis of our previous results and those
of others, we hypothesized that arsenite-transformed
cells secrete molecules to affect the surrounding envir-
onment,
leading
to
the
malignancy
of
neighboring
normal cells. In the present study, we observed upregu-
lated levels of circRNA_100284 in normal L-02 cells
treated with medium from arsenite-transformed L-02
cells, along with an accelerated cell cycle and increased
proliferation. These results conﬁrmed our assumption
that a cell cycle change and higher proliferation are

promoted by molecules secreted into the medium by
transformed cells.
The
transmitters
of
cell–cell
interactions
can
be
secreted proteins, ions, or exosomes. Exosomes, derived
from the endosomal compartment, are released in the
extracellular milieu under various physiological and
pathological conditions43. In the present study, we
showed that exosomes from arsenite-transformed L-02
cells, conﬁrmed by electron microscopy and transferred to
the
surrounding
cells,
are
transmitters
of
cell–cell
communication.
RNA isolated from exosome preparations contains cir-
cRNAs44. In the present study, we found that the levels of
circRNA_100284 were increased in exosomes derived
from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells. Moreover, exo-
somes derived from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells ele-
vated the levels of circRNA_100284 and promoted the cell
cycle and proliferation of normal L-02 cells. When
exposed to exosomes derived from arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells, the expression of EZH2, a potential biomarker
of proliferation45,46, and cyclin-D1, which regulates the
G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle47,48, increased in
normal L-02 cells. There was no such change in normal
cells treated with exosomes from passage-control L-02
cells. These changes were inhibited when the generation
of exosomes was inhibited by GW4869 or the expression
of circRNA_100284 was blocked in arsenite-transformed
L-02 cells. The results indicated that circRNA_100284,
shuttled from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells to normal
L-02 cells via exosomes, induced an accelerated cell cycle
and promoted proliferation of normal cells. Abnormal cell
proliferation resulting from deregulated cell cycle pro-
gression is involved in neoplastic transformation32. In the
present study, L-02 cells exposed to arsenite for 20 pas-
sages formed more colonies, showed enhanced invasion
and migration, and induced tumors in nude mice after
treatment
with
exosomes
derived
from
arsenite-
transformed cells compared to passage-control cells.
These results were reversed when the expression of cir-
cRNA_100284 was blocked in arsenite-transformed L-02
cells.
These
effects
indicated
that
exosomal
cir-
cRNA_100284 may lead to the malignant transformation
of non-transformed L-02 cells.
miRNAs are involved in regulation of the cell cycle
and
proliferation
of
HCC
cells49,50.
We
previously
reported
that,
for arsenite-transformed
HaCat cells,
circRNA_100284 regulates the cell cycle by acting as a
sponge of miR-21715, a tumor suppressor that regulates
cell proliferation in various cancers, including HCCs51.
miR-217 inhibits cell proliferation through inducing
arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle52. The
present results showed that overexpression of miR-217 in
normal cells reduced the increased levels of EZH2 and
cyclin-D1
induced
by
exosomes
from
arsenite-
transformed L-02 cells. An miR-217 inhibitor reversed
the effects, including the decreased levels of EZH2 and
cyclin-D1, and inhibited the cell cycle and proliferation
caused by exosomes from arsenite-transformed L-02 cells
transfected with circRNA_100284 siRNA. These results
show that exosomal circRNA_100284 regulates the cell
cycle and cell proliferation via miR-217. In cancers, miR-
217 targets EZH2 (refs.53,54). However, the mechanism for
regulation of EZH2 by miR-217 in L-02 cells and how it
affects
malignant
transformation
remain
to
be
determined.
In Guizhou Province, China, food contamination and
air pollution caused by coal burning have been linked to
severe arsenite exposure55,56. In the present study, blood
samples were collected from patients exposed to arsenite
and from healthy volunteers in Guizhou province. Exo-
somes were isolated from the sera. Arsenite exposure
induced
an
increase
of
circRNA_100284
levels

circulating exosomes. Thus, exosomal circRNA_100284
may be a biomarker for diagnosis of arsenicosis.
To conclude, long-term exposure to arsenite induced the
malignant transformation of L-02 cells and overexpression
of circRNA_100284, which could be shuttled from trans-
formed L-02 cells to normal cells via exosomes. In normal
cells, exosomal circRNA_100284 induced an accelerated
cell cycle and promoted proliferation via acting with miR-
217 (Fig. 8). These changes are apparently involved in
arsenite-induced malignant transformation. In sum, the
results demonstrate that exosomal circRNAs act as mes-
sengers
in
cell–cell
communication
and
suggest
a
mechanism for carcinogenesis induced by arsenite.

ABSTRACT: Factor analysis utilizes the covariance of composi-
tional variables to separate sources of ambient pollutants like
particulate matter (PM). However, meteorology causes concen-
tration variations in addition to emission rate changes. Conven-
tional positive matrix factorization (PMF) loses information from
the data because of these dilution variations. By incorporating the
ventilation coeﬃcient, dispersion normalized PMF (DN-PMF)
reduces the dilution eﬀects. DN-PMF was applied to hourly
speciated particulate composition data from a ﬁeld campaign that included the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. DN-PMF sharpened
the morning coal combustion and rush hour traﬃc peaks and lowered the daytime soil, aged sea salt, and waste incinerator
contributions that better reﬂect the actual emissions. These results identiﬁed signiﬁcant changes in source contributions after the
COVID-19 outbreak in China. During this pandemic, secondary inorganic aerosol became the predominant PM2.5 source
representing 50.5% of the mean mass. Fireworks and residential burning (32.0%), primary coal combustion emissions (13.3%),
primary traﬃc emissions (2.1%), soil and aged sea salt (1.2%), and incinerator (0.9%) represent the other contributors. Traﬃc
decreased dramatically (70%) compared to other sources. Soil and aged sea salt also decreased by 68%, likely from decreased traﬃc.
1. INTRODUCTION
Ambient ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5, particles with
aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) is a leading environmental
health risk factor, causing an estimated 7.6% of the total global
mortality and ranked as the ﬁfth highest mortality risk factor in
2015.1 It was the highest ranked risk factor for attributable
deaths in China.1 The State Council of China enacted a strict
Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in 2013 to
address the serious air pollution problems across the country,
thus better protecting public health.2 These clean air actions
have been eﬀective in reducing PM concentrations and the
related health burdens.3−5 Estimated national population-
weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations have decreased
from 61.8 μg m−3 in 2013 to 42 μg m−3 in 2017.5
Evaluation of the eﬀectiveness of the control measures is of
great interest to governments, stakeholders, and the general
public because it provides the basis for developing additional
policies. Zhang et al.5 found that the national mean PM2.5
concentrations from 2013 to 2017 were reduced through the
strengthening of emission standards. Zhang et al. combined
bottom-up emission inventories and chemical transport
modeling to provide measure-speciﬁc integrated evaluation of
their eﬀectiveness in PM2.5 reductions. Strengthening industrial
emission standards, upgrading industrial boilers, phasing out
outdated industrial activities, and promoting clean fuels in the
residential sector were responsible for 6.6, 4.4, 2.8, and 2.2 μg
m−3 reductions, respectively. Short-term improvements in air
quality were reported during the 2008 Olympic Games,6 2010
Asia Game in Guangzhou,7 and 2014 Asia-Paciﬁc Economic
Cooperation conference.8 However, the current PM2.5
concentrations in China remain well above the annual grade-
II limit values set by the national ambient air quality standards
of China (GB3095-2012)9 and health-based WHO guidance
levels.10
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) was ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan and quickly
expanded across China.11,12 Home-bound isolation strategies
were implemented for residents across China, with lockdown
measures imposed in Hubei Province. The Chinese Central
Government launched joint prevention and control mecha-
nisms among 32 central governmental departments imple-
menting measures beginning on January 20. Thirty-one
provinces in China launched the highest level of public health
emergency response for ∼30 days beginning on January 25.13

Responses undertaken by authorities at all levels in China to
reduce transmission included reducing public gatherings and
travel, stay at home orders, and home isolation of trans-
boundary travelers for 2 weeks. This period of substantially
reduced economic activity and mobility also provided an
opportunity to assess changes in source emissions and
promoting implementation of further emission reductions.
Source apportionment research is capable of identifying
potential sources and estimating their contributions so as to
help to design an air quality management framework to further
reduce PM2.5 concentrations. Factor analysis methods such as
positive matrix factorization (PMF) have been widely used for
source apportionment of ambient PM.14−16 The conventional
use of PMF is to extract source information from the
observation data based on the internal covariance of particulate
compositional variables. However, there are multiple sources of
variation in the ambient concentrations, including the source
emission rates, atmospheric chemistry, and meteorologically
induced dilution that the source material undergoes after being
released into the ambient air. Because of variation in
dispersion, some of the information content in the observation
data will be lost. In this work, we proposed dispersion
normalized PMF (DN-PMF) by incorporating an intermediate
step into PMF analysis to reduce the inﬂuence of meteorology.
To investigate the changes in source contributions to ambient
PM2.5 after the outbreak of COVID-19, DN-PMF was applied
to the hourly particle chemical species data measured from
January 1, 2020 to February 15, 2020.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Site Description and Instrumentation. Measure-
ments were conducted at an air quality supersite (117°24′ N,
38°59′ E) (Figure S1) on the campus of Nankai University in
the Jinan district of Tianjin, China from January 1 to February
15, 2020. The campus is ∼25 km southeast of downtown
Tianjin, is surrounded by several universities, and away from
major highways and high traﬃc zones (Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information). The site represents a typical
suburban area with relatively low population density. A waste
incineration plant is ∼7 km northwest (NW) of the site. There
are two-lane local roads to the north and west. All instruments
were housed in the supersite building with sampling inlets on
the roof. A number of trace gas pollutants, particle chemical
species, and meteorological parameters were monitored during
this campaign.
The PM2.5 mass concentrations were measured with a beta
attenuation particle monitor, and hourly sulfur dioxide (SO2),
nitrogen oxides (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone
(O3) (Focused Photonics Inc., China) were measured. Relative
humidity (RH), temperature (T), and wind direction/wind
speed were recorded using an automatic meteorological
observation system (LUFFT Inc., Germany). Solar radiation
was measured with a sun photometer (Kipp & Zonen Inc.,
Netherlands). Mixing layer height (MLH) was recorded using
a ceilometer (Vaisala Inc., Finland) at the Tianjin Eco-
Environmental Monitoring Station. Elements (Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V,
Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Ba, and Pb) were measured hourly
using an in situ X-ray ﬂuorescence instrument (Focused
Photonics Inc., China) and water-soluble ions (SO4
2−, NO3
−,
NH4
+, Cl−, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) by an in situ ion
chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., USA). Organic
carbon (OC) and element carbon (EC) were measured hourly
with a semicontinuous thermal-optical carbon analyzer
(Focused Photonics Inc., China). These particulate instru-
ments were equipped with a PM2.5 inlet. Daily checks were
made for all instruments to ensure their normal functioning.
Maintenance such as regular calibrations and ﬁlter replacement
was performed on the instruments, as directed by the
manufacturer. The detailed instrumentation information is
included in the Supporting Information (Table S1), and details
regarding the quality assurance and control are available in
reports by Tian et al. (2020).17
2.2. Dispersion-Normalized PMF. As an eﬀective source
apportionment tool, PMF has been extensively used. Details
can be found in the literature.14,18,19 PMF works by using
covariance of compositional variables to separate sources of
ambient PM. However, atmospheric dilution also induces
covariance. Dilution can be quantiﬁed in terms of a ventilation
coeﬃcient (VC) whose conceptual framework was ﬁrst
described by Holzworth.20 Named as “diﬀusion factor,” it
was introduced by Leahey21 to describe the ﬂuctuations in SO2
concentrations and subsequently reported by Kleinman et
al.22,23 to be used in applications to TSP data. The term
ventilation coeﬃcient ﬁrst appeared in the study by Ashraﬁet
al.,24 and this term has been more widely used in recent
literature. The VC is deﬁned for time period i as the mixed
layer height multiplied by the mean wind speed and has units
of m2 s−1. VC has been used as an index of the potential
volume into which air pollutants are diluted per unit time (e.g.,
Tiwari et al.25) and can be written as
=
×
̅u
VC
MLH
i
i

(1)
where MLHi is the mixed layer height for time period I, and u̅i
is the mean wind speed during time interval i. The inﬂuence of
local dispersion on the observed concentrations can be
reduced by normalizing the data to the average VC over the
whole sampling period to produce dispersion normalized
concentrations.

where CVC, i is dispersion normalized concentrations, Ci is the
concentration measured during period i, and VCmean is the
average value of VC over the whole sampling period, which is
590 m2 s−1 for this campaign. Thus, at night when the VC is
low, the concentrations increase because of poor dispersion.
Therefore, we scale the concentrations down to that they have
values that they would have had if the mixed layer height and
wind speed were equal to the mean VC value. During the
afternoon when the VC is high, the normalized concentration
will be scaled upward. The concentrations and uncertainties in
the original data matrix are normalized on a sample by sample
basis, and the dispersion normalized concentrations and
uncertainties are used as the input to PMF analysis.
In this study, US EPA PMF v5.0 was used for PMF analyses.
Details on the input data treatment and uncertainty estimates
are provided in the Supporting Information. Bootstrap (BS)
and displacement (DISP) analyses were used to investigate the
eﬀects of measurement error and rotation ambiguity on the
resulting solutions. To further reduce the rotation space and
improve the accuracy of source estimates, a priori information
such as point source location relative to wind direction, or
knowing when speciﬁc unusual source emissions occur, can be
incorporated into analysis to interpret and constrain
solutions.26

The diel patterns of each source derived from both the
unnormalized PMF and DN-PMF were averaged over the
sampling period and are compared to examine their diﬀer-
ences. Conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF)
analysis was used to facilitate the identiﬁcation of the factors
and examine the source directionality from PMF and DN-
PMF. It is capable of discriminating diﬀerent source types
using their wind speed dependency, particularly for distant
point sources. Further details regarding the CBPF analyses are
available elsewhere.27 CBPF plots were prepared using the

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Overview of the Observations. The data for the
measured PM (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10), gaseous pollutants
(SO2, NO2, CO, and O3), and the meteorological conditions
during the monitoring period are shown in Figure 1. Selected
particulate chemical species are presented in Figure 2. The
average concentrations of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 during this
campaign were 44.5 ± 40.3, 93.4 ± 72.8, and 143.1 ± 97.1 μg
m−3, ranging from 1.0 to 224.1, 3.9 to 333.0, and 13.2 to 434.5
μg m−3, respectively. PM concentrations were elevated under
poor dispersion conditions (periods of lower wind speed and
MLH), resulting in low VC values. There are ﬁve high haze
events during which daily PM2.5 concentrations exceeded to
150 μg m−3. Three of these events (January 1 to 5, January 15
to 20, and January 21 to 23) occurred prior to the widespread
outbreak of COVID-19 across China. The other two events
occurred at the beginning of the Spring Festival (SF, January
24 to 30) and during the Lantern Festival (February 8),
respectively. The high PM pollution events tended to end
when the VC increased. On January 23, hourly PM2.5
decreased from 258 μg m−3 at 11:00 am to 87.2 μg m−3 at
3:00 pm as VC increased from 253 to ∼6200 m2 s−1. During
the SF, a heavy pollution event lasted for 86 h with a daily
average VC less than 200 m2 s−1. PM2.5 concentrations reached
its highest observed value (333.0 μg m−3) at 4:00 pm on
January 26 when VC was only 81 m2 s−1.
As shown in Figure 1 and Table S2, the pattern of CO
concentrations signiﬁcantly correlated with PM2.5 across the
whole campaign (r2 = 0.615). This correlation indicates that
the PM2.5 variations were highly inﬂuenced by the local
meteorological conditions. NO2 also moderately correlated
with PM2.5 (r2 = 0.342), while SO2 covaried with PM2.5 only
during the ﬁrst pollution event (r2 = 0.391). SO2 and PM2.5
poorly correlated during the rest of the measurement period
(r2 = 0.089). Thus, the pollutant concentrations were driven by
both the meteorological conditions and the emissions from
fossil fuel combustion that generated the gaseous pollutants.
To reduce the inﬂuence of dispersion conditions on source
estimates, dispersion normalized source apportionment
approach was developed.
3.2. Comparison of PMF and DN-PMF Solutions.
3.2.1. Solution Selection and Interpretation. PMF solutions
were explored from two to nine factors for both the original
data and the dispersion normalized data. The best ﬁts to the
data were chosen by examining the model performance,
including the distributions of scaled residuals and the
interpretability of factors.30,31 The selected solutions were
then subjected to BS and DISP tests.32
Six-factor models were chosen as the optimal ﬁts for both
data sets (unnormalized and normalized). For the DN-PMF
solution, the contributions were unnormalized by dividing by
the normalization ratio, as shown in eq 2, to reproduce the
originally measured values. The model-predicted PM2.5 mass
concentrations correlated with the observed values with
squared correlation coeﬃcients (r2) of 0.939 and 0.943 for
PMF and DN-PMF, respectively (Figure S2). The conven-
tional PMF and DN-PMF factor proﬁles are presented
separately in Figures S3 and S4. The factor contribution
time series are shown in Figure S5. Both the unnormalized
PMF and DN-PMF estimated substantial contributions of
ﬁreworks and residential burning before the start of the SF are
shown in Figure S5. However, there were no ﬁreworks displays
during this pre-SF period. The ﬁreworks only began around
dinner time on the Lunar New Year’s Eve (January 24). With
this a priori information, constraints were applied to the
solutions to pull the g-values of ﬁreworks and residential
burning toward zero for the period before 6:00 pm on January
24. At that time, the ﬁreworks tracers, Mg2+, K+, and Ba, had
their lowest concentrations and then sharply increased
(Figures 2 and S6). Factor proﬁles resolved from g-value-
constrained PMF and DN-PF are shown in Figure 3. The time
series of constrained PMF analysis and the constrained DN-
PMF contributions are presented in Figure 4. The CBPF and
PSCF plots for each source for both analyses are shown in
Figures 5 and S8. The correlation coeﬃcients of measured
PM2.5 versus predicted concentrations derived from con-
strained solutions are 0.944 for both PMF and DN-PMF, and
the slopes are between 0.91 and 0.93 (Figure S2). For these
solutions, there were no DISP swaps. The BS-constrained PMF

and DN-PMF solutions had at least 85 and 94% agreement
with the base case results, respectively.
The ﬁrst factor was interpreted as ﬁreworks and residential
burning because it featured high K+, Mg2+, Ti, and Ba-
explained variances and relatively high concentrations of OC,
EC, SO4
2−, and NO3
−. These species have relatively narrow
DISP intervals. K+ and Ba are indictive of ﬁreworks
emissions.33−35 K+ is a major component of black powder in
the form of KNO3 or KClO3. Barium compounds [BaClO3 and
Ba(NO3)2] act as oxidizers.32 A basic ﬁreworks material is
magnalium alloy (95% Al and 5% Mg) that is used for sparks
and crackling stars and produces Mg2+. Many studies observed
high concentrations of similarly metalliferous composition,
such as Sr, Ba, Al, K, Mg, Ba, Ti, Pb, and Cu at diﬀerent
locations during ﬁreworks display days across the world.36−38
Fireworks are intensively displayed across the country during
the SF, particularly on Chinese New Year’s Eve (January 24).
In addition to ﬁreworks emissions, OC and EC in the proﬁle
likely included emissions from residential coal/wood burning,
with large bonﬁres to celebrate the festival. A tradition with a
long history in northern China is “Sheng Wang Huo.” It is a
large pillar of coal and wood that is set alight and burns for up
to 5 days. It is generally ignited on New Year’s Eve, but it is
also burned for other festivals and major events such as the
Lantern Festival. To reduce its impact on air pollution, this
event was banned in urban areas by many local governments in
recent years. However, using an online questionnaire that we
posted for Nankai University students, Sheng Wang Huo was
observed this year during the SF and Lantern Festivals in rural
areas particularly in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and Hebei
Provinces (Figure S6). Thus, this factor was labeled as
“ﬁreworks and residential burning” because it is a mixture of
ﬁreworks and coal/wood burning emissions, including Sheng
Wang Huo emissions. Fireworks were generally banned in
urban areas. Thus, the emissions were collocated in suburban

policy this year. However, ﬁreworks were still displayed in its
surrounding areas. Figure 2 shows the K+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO4
2−,
and OC concentrations, while Figure S7 shows Ba and Ti
values. All of these species were all signiﬁcantly elevated during
the SF after its start with Chinese New Year’s Eve and
increased again during the lunar Lantern Festival. This result
indicates that although large personal ﬁreworks displays were
banned, it appears that people still shoot oﬀﬁreworks during
the festival times. Fireworks particles can last in air for up to 4
days.32 The contribution of ﬁreworks and residential burning
increased dramatically from midnight on January 24 (Chinese
Lunar New Year) until 3 days later. Heavy haze pollution
occurred from January 25 to 29 driven largely by locally
transported ﬁreworks and residential burning emissions and
facilitated by low VC values (Figure 1a). Particulate pollution
covered the whole Beijing−Tianjin−Hebei areas and lasted for
4−5 days until a strong northwesterly ﬂow occurred.
Contributions of ﬁreworks and residential burning were
again elevated on February 8, consistent with the lunar
Lantern Festival.39 The PSCF plot (Figure S8) shows that
most of the probable source areas were from the areas in south
but relatively near Tianjin. However, there was clear transport
from N and NW.
The incinerator factor is characterized by high Cu and Cr
with associated narrow DISP bands, and EC with a relatively
wide DISP bound. Incinerator ﬂy ash was reported as an
important source of heavy metal pollution in China,40 but the
emissions from waste combustion vary with the input waste
materials. For example, the incineration of plastic materials will
produce Cr in the ash.41 The CBPF plot of the incinerator
shows a clear NW direction pointing to the waste incineration
plant (Figure 5). Figure S1 shows the CBPF plot super-
imposed on a satellite image to show that this source is the
municipal incinerator.
The third factor is dominated by Si, Ca, Fe, Mn, and some of
OC, NO3
−, SO4
2−and Ba and was attributed to soil and aged
sea salt. The DISP bounds are small for Si, Ca, and Fe while
relatively large for the others, indicating the mixing nature of
soil involved in anthropogenic emissions and transported sea
salt. Cl−has a small concentration but a relatively large DISP
interval. The CBPF plots show a high probability values in the
direction of SE where sea breeze from Bohai Bay transports the
marine aerosol to the measurement site. Bohai Bay is ∼30 km
southeast from this site. Sea salt was previously resolved as a
source of PM in both coastal and inland areas around
Tianjin.42 Cl−in fresh sea salt was likely depleted by sulfate
and nitrate during transport.43
Traﬃc emissions are composed primarily of EC and NO3
−
with tight DISP intervals, some OC with relatively large DISP
bound and some small concentrations of Cl−, K+, Fe, Zn, Pb,
and As. Zn is known to be an additive in oil. Fe, Zn, and As can
be emitted from brake ablation44−46 and Zn from tire wear.47
Cl and K were reported from vehicle emissions.48 Compared
with the factor derived from PMF, there are no Si and Ca
presented in the DN-PMF derived factor, suggesting that the
DN-PMF-derived traﬃc factor is attributed to both primary
tailpipe and nontailpipe emissions without road dust. The
CBPF plots show high probability values in the prevailing
direction from the Tianjin downtown (NW). The inﬂuence of
close-by local lanes to the N and NE is also seen in the DN-
PMF plot.
The factor characterized by high NO3
−, SO4
2−, and NH4
+
with narrow DISP bounds was identiﬁed as secondary
inorganic aerosol (SIA). The presence of OC and EC in this
factor is in accordance with typical mixed SIA factors reported
in other studies.39,49,50 Freshly emitted EC provides a surface
for condensation of oxidized co-emitted gaseous pollutants
that form sulfate and nitrate. This short-term sampling
campaign was unlikely to be able to separate sulfate from
nitrate because it is usually necessary to have larger seasonal
diﬀerences to provide the needed edge points. The CBPF plots
show that there are higher probabilities from SE direction with
higher wind speed, this SE directionality has a degree of
overlap with the soil and aged sea salt factor, suggesting the
impact of marine aerosols from Bohai bay on its coastal area
like Tianjin and road dust suspended by intense city traﬃc.
The SIA CBPF plot has a pronounced lobe in the NWW
direction. NO3
−, SO4
2−, and NH4
+ were signiﬁcantly elevated

the maximum hourly PM2.5 concentration reached as high as
283.8 μg m−3. Nitrate and sulfate have been widely reported as
the dominate species in particles during severe haze episodes in
the Beijing−Tianjin−Hebei area.51,52 Regional transport is
founded to be much strong under high PM2.5 concentrations
than in clean days.46 During the observed heavy haze events,
surface wind speeds decreased dramatically with a prevailingly
NNW direction (Figure 1d). As suggested in the CBPF and
PSCF plots (Figure S8), the observed SIA was more likely
enhanced by regional transport than local formation.
The ﬁnal factor featured high concentrations of OC, NH4
+,
Cl−, Fe, Zn, K+, Mn, and Pb was assigned for coal combustion.
Those species have smaller DISP ranges than the others. The
factor accounted for 31% of the variance of As, indicating its
coal emission nature. Coal is the major energy used for space
heating in northern China during the cold season. The high
Cl−and lower EC in this proﬁle is likely high temperature coal
combustion via coal-ﬁred power plants and district heating-
supply plants. Cl was previously found to be associated with
coal combustion.53,54 The narrow DISP intervals on
ammonium and Cl−in the proﬁle is similar with a coal
combustion factor reported by Li et al.,48 who suggested that
ammonium chloride was formed through the reaction of
ambient ammonia with HCl emitted from coal combustion. A
previous study reported by Dai et al.53 found that coal burned
in household stoves was the major source of ambient sulfate
during winter. However, there is no sulfate presented in the
factor in this analysis, but there is a moderately large DISP
interval, indicating that this factor could include some sulfate
through rotation. The contributions for the coal combustion
were elevated signiﬁcantly during the ﬁrst pollution episodes,
consistent with the variation of SO2.
Comparison of source contributions estimated using con-
strained PMF and DN-PMF are presented in Figure 6.
According to the constrained unnormalized PMF, SIA was
responsible for the largest fraction of PM2.5 mass on average
(50.5%), followed by ﬁreworks and residential burning
(19.6%), coal combustion (19.1%), soil + aged sea salt
(6.0%), incinerator (2.8%), and traﬃc emissions (2.1%).
Compared to the constrained PMF results, the constrained
DN-PMF enhanced the traﬃc emissions, coal combustion, and
ﬁreworks and residential burning by 110, 39, and 8%,
respectively. While incinerator, soil and aged sea salt, and
SIA were lowered by 64, 58, and 12%, respectively. On an
average, coal combustion appears to be the predominant
primary source of PM2.5 for the measurement campaign.
3.2.2. Source Directionality and Diel Emission Patterns.
Compared with data from regular PMF, the CBPF plots
created from DN-PMF results highlight the local inﬂuence of
coal combustion, traﬃc emissions, and SIA. The direction-
alities of these sources tend to narrow down and clearer after
dispersion normalization. In addition to local emissions, results
from DN-PMF also show a strong directionality from NW for
coal combustion and traﬃc emissions as it is the prevailing
direction from Tianjin downtown where tremendous particles
emission from traﬃc and coal burning can be substantially
transported to the monitoring site. The soil and aged sea salt
factor was sensitive to both wind speed and direction, and DN-
PMF enhances the regional nature of soil and aged sea salt by
lowering its local eﬀect. The incinerator location has been
clearly pointed out after dispersion normalization. The CBPF
plots of ﬁreworks and residential burning show similar uniform
probabilities for PMF and DN-PMF with strong local nature.
As previously mentioned, the extensive period of ﬁreworks and
residential burning occurred after the Chinese New Year’s Eve
and coincided with a period of extremely low VC (weak
winds). Thus, it was enhanced by dispersion conditions and
only transported from surrounding areas on the low air mass
speeds.
Diel patterns of the meteorological parameters, gaseous and
particulate pollutants, and six PMF-resolved sources are
presented in Figure 7. The DN-PMF sharpened the morning
peak of coal combustion around 11:00 am, which was likely
due to the downmixing of high stack emissions of coal-ﬁred

power plants and heating-supply plants along with the
transported PM. The traﬃc emission peaked at 7:00 am, at
noon, and then dropped until 5:00 pm. The DN-PMF
enhanced the traﬃc emission pattern by increasing the midday
peak when VC values are high and yielded a clearer broad
evening rush hour peak. Given that this site is located in a
suburban area away from signiﬁcant traﬃc congestion and this
measurement campaign occurred during several unusual
events, the traﬃc diel pattern was unlike the common
“business as usual” morning peak as is typically seen at high
traﬃc sites.55,56 SIA had its lowest values in the early morning
between 4:00 and 6:00 am and peaked at ∼10:00 am and
midnight. The daytime increase likely resulted from down-
mixing of transported aerosol from aloft. As shown in Figure
S9, sulfate shows a slight peak at 9:00 am in the morning while
nitrate peaked at noon when there would have been greater
photochemical formation of gaseous nitric acid.
Ratios of sulfate to nitrate presents a clear morning peak and
down to a minimum in the afternoon. Thus, sulfate was mostly
coming from downmixing after the breakup of overnight
inversions. The midday peak of particulate nitrate was more
likely locally formed via the pathway of HNO3 + NH3. There
would be increased OH during the morning that then reacts
with NO2 to produce HNO3 to then form NH4NO3 in the
presence of available NH3. The cold weather favors the
formation of the particulate phase. The soil and aged sea salt
factor increased from morning because it was strongly related
to wind speeds. The DN-PMF reduced the wind inﬂuence by
reducing its concentration for high wind speed period. The
incinerator emissions had a clear peak during daytime. As
shown in the wind rose plots (Figure S10), winds coming from
NW were much stronger during daytime than nighttime. The
daytime prevailing wind direction from NW will certainly
transport particles emitted from the incinerator eﬃciently to
the measurement site. DN-PMF thus decreased the wind eﬀect
by lowering the daytime peak as well. The pattern of the diel
ﬁreworks and residential burning proﬁle (peaked at 9:00 am) is
very similar for both PMF analyses and likely increased
morning burning to reheat the homes. These diel proﬁles are
indicative of the enhanced emission patterns extracted by DN-
PMF.
3.3. Changes in Source Contributions after the
COVID-19 Outbreak. Because the measurement includes
the unusual event of the SF, the whole campaign was divided
into three periods: before SF, during SF, and after SF to
examine the changes in source contributions (Figure 6).
Emergency response for the outbreak of COVID-19 was
implemented beginning on January 25 in Tianjin. Comparison
of the source contributions during the three periods illuminates
the eﬀects of the response measures on air pollution.
Before the SF, the predominant sources of PM2.5 were SIA
(51.7%) and coal combustion (37.6%), followed by traﬃc
emissions (6.0%), soil and aged sea salt (3.7%), and incinerator
(1.0%). Fireworks and residential burning were the predom-
inant source with average contribution of 59.5% during the SF
and dropped to 32.0% after the SF. Fireworks and residential
burning also occur after the SF because the Lantern Festival is
included in the study period. After the SF, SIA increased to a
level comparable to the pre-SF proportion with an average
contribution of 50.5%. Traﬃc emissions decreased continu-
ously to 1.7% of PM2.5 mass. Similarly, contribution of soil and
aged sea salt also declined to 1.2%. The incinerator kept its
lower contribution to PM2.5 mass (∼1.0%) over the whole
campaign.
After the outbreak of COVID-19, traﬃc contribution
dropped signiﬁcantly with a 70% decline. The contributions
of soil and aged sea salt were also decreased by 68%. It is very
clear that road dust resuspended by moving vehicles
substantially declined with the reduced traﬃc volume.
Although primary emissions from coal combustion decreased
after the SF compared to the period before the SF, coal
combustion still remained to be the largest primary source of
PM2.5 during and after the SF excluding ﬁreworks and
residential burning. Because the traﬃc ﬂow decreased
dramatically, NOx emitted from vehicles declined as well. A
large fraction of secondary nitrate was therefore attributed to
the oxidation of NOx emissions from coal combustion after the
outbreak of COVID-19. Thus, coal combustion appears to be
the largest source of PM2.5. These results suggest the signiﬁcant
changes occurred in source contributions after the COVID-19
outbreak.

Abstract
Multi-tiered sampling approaches are common in environmental and occupational exposure
assessment, where exposures for a given individual are often modeled based on simultaneous
measurements taken at multiple indoor and outdoor sites. The monitoring data from such studies is
hierarchical by design, imposing a complex covariance structure that must be accounted for in order
to obtain unbiased estimates of exposure. Statistical methods such as structural equation modeling
(SEM) represent a useful alternative to simple linear regression in these cases, providing
simultaneous and unbiased predictions of each level of exposure based on a set of covariates specific
to the exposure setting. We test the SEM approach using data from a large exposure assessment of
diesel and combustion particles in the US trucking industry. The exposure assessment includes data
from 36 different trucking terminals across the United States sampled between 2001 and 2005,
measuring PM2.5 and its elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) components, by personal
monitoring, and sampling at two indoor work locations and an outdoor “background” location. Using
the SEM method, we predict: 1) personal exposures as a function of work related exposure and
smoking status; 2) work related exposure as a function of terminal characteristics, indoor ventilation,
job location, and background exposure conditions; and 3) background exposure conditions as a
function of weather, nearby source pollution, and other regional differences across terminal sites.
The primary advantage of SEMs in this setting is the ability to simultaneously predict exposures at
each of the sampling locations, while accounting for the complex covariance structure among the
measurements and descriptive variables. The statistically significant results and high R2 values
observed from the trucking industry application supports the broader use of this approach in exposure
assessment modeling.

Introduction
Diesel exhaust contains respirable particles with mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds (1)
and has been linked to increased risk of lung cancer mortality in over 35 epidemiologic studies
(2,3). Of particular interest are the rates in occupational groups exposed to diesel exhaust, such
as the trucking and railroad industries. Although epidemiologic studies illuminating the
increased cancer risks are numerous, none of these studies have included detailed exposure
assessments, and for this reason the dose-response relationship remains uncertain (4). While
multiple national and international health organizations have declared diesel exhaust to be a
“probable” human carcinogen (5,6,7,8), the lack of quantitative exposure data has been
consistently cited as the fundamental problem in determining causality from the existing
occupational health studies of diesel exposure (2,9).
In an attempt to address this issue, the Trucking Industry Particle Study was carefully planned
as a joint effort in exposure assessment and epidemiology (10). Our hypothesis was that
trucking industry workers are highly exposed to diesel exhaust because of their close proximity
to operating diesel trucks. Elemental carbon (EC), which is a major component of diesel engine
emissions, was chosen as a marker for diesel exposure. A national exposure assessment
collecting PM2.5, EC, and OC data has been conducted to complement epidemiologic data on
lung cancer mortality for workers in this industry. The epidemiologic study is being conducted
with cooperation from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and four large unionized
trucking companies. This retrospective cohort study contains approximately 55,000 people
working in 1985, whose lung cancer mortality experience has been determined through the
year 2000. The exposure assessment is intended to provide data for the epidemiology study,
monitoring exposures at the four trucking companies to define current exposure levels in the
industry. These estimates, coupled with information on policy and regulatory changes across
time, will enable us to predict historical levels and assign cumulative exposure to members in
the epidemiology cohort, and to ultimately estimate lung cancer risk for this occupational
group.
Although we are using EC as a surrogate, or marker of diesel emissions, other combustion
sources also emit EC and OC, and the amounts of EC and OC emitted by diesels varies with
driving conditions (11). Lightly loaded and idling diesel emissions have low EC and high OC
and are indistinguishable from general gasoline engine emissions. Previous measurements
made by our study team indicated that diesel exhaust is the dominant source of EC in the
terminal work locations (representing all engine operating conditions). Furthermore, EC is not
a significant component of cigarette smoke (0.49%), and is a small component of gasoline car
engine emissions (2–5 mg/km) and propane emissions, when compared to heavy-duty truck
engine emissions (early 1990’s technology, 164 mg/km) (12). Therefore, the EC in terminal
locations is primarily an indicator of diesel emissions with some influence from car and forklift
exhaust, and other combustion particles, such as from home oil heating and outdoor burning
in some locations and seasons.
Methods and Data Collection
Our sampling plan was designed to measure particle exposures of fine particle mass (PM2.5)
and two of its components, elemental carbon (EC) and organic compounds (OC) at a randomly
selected and regionally representative set of large US truck freight terminals (>100 employees)
from four participating companies. Samples were taken during a 5-day period, and a new
terminal was visited approximately every month during 2001–2005 for a total of 36 site visits.
The terminal locations are widely scattered across the United States (see Figure A-1,
Supporting Information), and due to relatively strict union work rules, the occupational groups
within our cohort are well defined and homogeneous. The freight dock operates 24 hr/day,

7days a week, and the major onsite jobs at trucking terminals are dockworkers and mechanics,
along with office workers and hostlers (onsite drivers). The truck transport operations are
separated into drivers making local (P&D) and long distance (LH) trips. This paper exclusively
models onsite worker exposures in the shop (mechanics) and dock (dockworkers), which
represent the major onsite worker groups exposed to combustion particles in this occupational
cohort.
A visual representation of the trucking terminal work locations is provided in Figure A-2,
Supporting Information. At the center of the trucking terminal is the loading dock, which is an
elongated warehouse building where freight is moved from one trailer to another. The trailers
are backed up to a raised platform on the dock with a series of doors along each side. A large
terminal may have hundreds of doors and have a dock that is hundreds of meters long. Freight
is moved between trailers by dockworkers driving small liquid propane powered forklifts
within the semi-enclosed dock area. Truck tractors and trailers that have been damaged or need
to be serviced are taken to an onsite shop to be repaired by a mechanic, while those terminals
without shops contract out their repair and maintenance needs. The fenced in area of the
terminal property outside the dock and shop is known as the “yard”.
A worker’s exposure was hypothesized to be defined by three components, which each have
a set of factors associated with them: personal factors (work area, cigarette smoking), work
area factors (terminal size, numbers of mechanics and pickup and delivery drivers, job,
ventilation, yard background), and yard background factors (relative humidity, temperature,
wind speed, distance to highways, land use, region of US). Personal exposures were monitored
through the use of particle samplers placed in a special vest, which ran for the entire duration
of the work shift (approximately 8–12 hours); very few workers were sampled more than once.
Work area concentrations were monitored with stationary box samplers in the indoor work
locations, and were collected at consecutive twelve-hour intervals that generally overlapped
with the personal samples. Background measurements were made in an upwind location in the
yard for each terminal sampled, and were also collected in consecutive twelve-hour intervals.
For modeling purposes, personal measurements were matched to the work area and yard
measurements that most closely overlap the time period of a given sample.
Measurement Methods
Airborne particles in outdoor and occupational settings are a complex mixture and the
components vary as a function of the sources. Three aspects of fine particle matter were
assessed that might together serve as indicators of exposure to diesel exhaust and other
combustion products: mass of particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5), and
elemental carbon (EC) and organic compounds (OC) in particles less than 1 micron in diameter
(PM1). EC was chosen as our primary marker of diesel exposure in this study, but its
relationship with mass of diesel emissions varies with operating conditions.
We also noted an artifact associated with OC data obtained from area and personal samples
collected where there was cigarette smoking. It is known that quartz fiber filters will adsorb
polar hydrocarbon vapors from the air stream and cigarette smoke has a high concentration of
polar vapors (13,14). In those settings, the OC content frequently exceeded the PM2.5, and we
have not used this data in OC exposure models.
The particle collectors, their pumps, and a real time monitor for temperature and humidity
(HOBO, Onset Computer Corp, Bourne, MA) were all mounted in a box housing (or jacket
worn by employee volunteers) connected to an external battery. PM2.5 was collected on a 37
mm Teflon filter, 0.2 μm diameter pore size, after passing through a precision machined,
cyclone separator (GK2.05 SH (KTL), BGI, Inc., Waltham, MA) to remove particles greater
than 2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter. Mass collected on the filter was determined by gravimetric

analysis using an analytical balance (Mettler Micro-Gravimetric No. M5; Mettler Instruments
Corporation, Hightstown, NJ). The filters were weighted after humidity equilibrium (>48 h)
in a chamber. At the end of sampling, the filter was taken back to the laboratory and reweighed
(after humidity equilibrium, >48 h) to determine weight gain. EC and OC were determined by
the NIOSH 5040 method (15). PM1 was collected on a 22 mm Quartz tissue filter, preceded
by a precision machined cyclone separator (SCC1.062 Triplex, BGI, Inc., Waltham, MA) to
remove particles greater than 1.0 μm aerodynamic diameter.
Finally, a small recording anemometer and wind vane were set up next to the yard sampler,
and we attempted to place the sampler upwind of the terminal within about 45° of the prevailing
wind. As expected, the wind direction was rarely stable, and in several cases, it was necessary
to move the sampler to another location when a major weather system moved through the area.
However, it was not feasible to move the upwind sampler during frequent minor wind shifts,
±45°.
Data Description
The primary response variable for this analysis is personal exposure to EC as measured by the
sampling jackets worn by employees on the dock and in the shop during their work shifts. OC
and PM2.5 were also modeled. There are a total of 689 personal observations, and the group
arithmetic and geometric means and standard deviations are listed in Table 1. For the statistical
model, the total number of observations were reduced somewhat by missing data on smoking
status, terminal characteristics, and matching session data for work area, yard, and weather
measurements. However, this subset of the data (n=547) did not vary significantly from the
complete dataset, and was therefore determined to be a representative sample. We cross-
validated our background exposure measurements with nearby monitoring data from the EPA
Air Quality System (see Discussion A-1, Table A-1, Supporting Information).
Detailed data on terminal operations during our visit was collected in order to accurately
account for the impact of terminal activities on measured work area particle concentrations.
This information included 16 different variables, such as the number of employees by job,
equipment data, and building dimensions (see Table A-2, Supporting Information, for all
covariate summary statistics). There were too many highly correlated variables to use them
directly, so a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to generate potential
covariates for the statistical model (see Discussion A-2, Table A-3, Supporting Information).
Work location (shop or dock) and indoor ventilation rates were also identified as important
predictors of particle exposure. Particles in these locations came from sources within and
outside the work areas. For both the shop and dock, emissions from activities in the yard and
local air pollution may enter the work areas through open doors. Both areas also have internal
emission sources: in the dock area groups of 3–10 forklifts (each with limited emissions) move
freight in and out of trailers; and in the shop, tractors are driven in and out (brief intense
emissions), but rarely operated indoors during repairs. All of the shops had tight fitting doors,
which were closed during cold weather. The freight docks usually did not have closing doors,
but 60–95% of the doors will be blocked by trailers. Particle concentrations in shops have been
shown to be significantly higher than those in the dock due to more emissions in a smaller
space (16,17,18). Also, cold temperatures can impact indoor dock and shop particle exposures
thru door closures (or the blockage of openings with trailers), resulting in indoor particle
concentrations several-fold higher, with a particularly strong effect in the shop (17,18). To
control for these effects, an indicator variable designating work location, and an interaction
variable of work location and outdoor temperature, are included in the model to identify the
strength of the winter closure effect and to test for differences across the two work locations.

In order to predict background particle levels, data on weather, as well as regional and location-
specific characteristics were collected to describe the area immediately surrounding each of
the study locations. Although the true effects of weather variables are difficult to identify in a
regression modeling context and can vary widely by season and location (19), site-specific
weather data are included in the model to control for their effects. Weather data on wind speed,
relative humidity, precipitation, temperature, and barometric pressure were observed from the
closest monitoring station matched to the specific sampling time periods using an online source
(20). The weather variables from this online source correlated very highly with a limited set
of weather observations made by our onsite weather station.
A series of background characteristics were constructed around the point of the geocoded
terminal address using GIS software (ArcGIS 9.0, ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA), including
industrial land use categorizations and distance to a major road. In the first, raster images from
the 1992 National Land Cover Data (NLCD) of the U.S. Geological Survey were used to
generate a variable for the percent of industrial, commercial, and transportation land uses in
the immediate vicinity of the terminal (1 kilometer buffer). Another variable was generated to
indicate the distance to a major road (any type), but it had little variability across terminals
because all are located at major road intersections. However, a more interesting and variable
feature was the terminal’s proximity to heavily trafficked interstate highways. Studies suggest
a rapid exponential decay of particles starting within 100 meters of the traffic sources, leading
to concentrations statistically indistinguishable from background levels at a distance of 300–
500 meters depending on wind patterns (21,22,23,24,25). Although there are currently an
insufficient number of observations in our dataset to detect this exponential decay function,
eleven of the 36 terminals are located within 500 meters of an interstate highway and several
are in close proximity to multiple interstate highways.
Finally, a categorical variable for Census Bureau Regions is included in the model of to control
for regional differences in particle concentrations left unexplained by the earlier covariates.
The United States is separated into four regions and nine divisions by the Census Bureau (See
Figure A-3, Supporting Information), which also corresponds to the regional categorizations
used for the ongoing diesel epidemiology study of lung cancer mortality. Census regions are
used (as opposed to divisions) due to lack of variability within each of the nine divisions –
relatively few site visits were observed within each division to provide stable estimates.
Statistical Model
All of the statistical analyses were performed using STATA Version 8.2, College Station, TX.
The concentration data are approximately lognormal, and have been log-transformed to meet
normality assumptions. A structural equation model (SEM) approach was developed to analyze
the data, a method that is becoming increasingly popular among environmental epidemiologists
as a way of handling high dimensional data (26). SEM methods are useful in understanding
causal pathways and identifying the indirect effects of intermediate variables on a primary
dependent variable (such as occupational exposure to particles). In our setting, SEMs provide
a way to analyze the data that reflects the natural hierarchy present in our sampling scheme,
namely background, work area, and personal exposures. This relationship is exemplified in the
pathway diagram presented in Figure A-4, Supporting Information.
In particular, the nature of the sampling plan imposes a complex covariance structure on the
collected data since the concurrent measurements taken by personal sampling jackets,
stationary work area samplers, and external measurements of background conditions are not
independent. Different sources contribute simultaneously to the measurements observed at
different locations (personal, area, yard) within the terminals during the same time periods. Of
particular statistical concern is the correlation among the error terms, as well as the correlation
Davis et al.

between the response variables and the error terms. Both of these conditions violate necessary
assumptions for ordinary least squares.
Therefore, instead of trying to fit one large model encompassing all covariates simultaneously,
we fit three related models. Using the SEM method, we simultaneously predict personal
exposures as a function of work related exposure and smoking status; work related exposure
as a function of terminal characteristics, indoor ventilation, job location, and background
exposure conditions; and background exposure conditions as a function of weather, nearby
source pollution, and other regional differences across terminal sites. This multi-layered
structure allows us to use the statistical technique known as three stage least squares (3SLS),
a common SEM approach in econometrics (27,28). The advantage of this particular method is
that it provides coefficient estimates for all of the covariates in the model, along with equation
specific R2 values to interpret each level of exposure data.
Results
The current SEM model (shown below) estimates exposure to EC for person i in job location
j at terminal k, as measured by the concentrations collected from sampling jackets worn by the
employees during their work shifts. There were very few repeated measurements across
individuals for the personal samples, and due to the timing of the measurements (by shift), the
correlation in these samples across time was negligible. The data are formatted to match the
personal samples by time period (session) with indoor work exposures and outdoor background
conditions, as well as job location, terminal characteristics, smoking status, and other covariates
for each subject.

Personal particle concentrations are predicted by matching work area exposures and smoking
status. The work area exposures are predicted by terminal-specific characteristics [terminal
size (yard dimensions), number of local (P&D) drivers and number of mechanics], ventilation
(interaction term of job location and outdoor temperature), matching background exposures
observed in the yard, and the job identification [dockworker (0) or mechanic(1)]. Finally,
background exposures observed in the yard are predicted by weather (relative humidity,
temperature, and wind speed), proximity to a major road (0=less than 500m to interstate, 1
otherwise), industrial land use characteristics (% of industrial, commercial, and transportation
land uses within a 1km radius), and regional location within the United States.
The logarithmic transformation of the concentration variables and the subsequent
multiplicative regression model requires careful interpretation of the coefficients. For this
reason, each of the results is discussed separately in terms of the estimated effect of a one
standard deviation increase on personal exposure to particles for dockworkers and mechanics.
As the primary marker of diesel exposure in this study, the results for EC (Table 2) are presented
in detail, followed by additional comments on the model results for OC (Table A-4, Supporting
Information) and PM2.5 (Table A-5, Supporting Information).

Personal Exposure
(log(PersonalECijk) = β10 + β11log(WorkAreaECjk) + β12(Smokingijk) + εijk) As shown in
Table 2, personal exposure to EC is significantly predicted by work area concentrations and
smoking status (R2=0.64). Based on the coefficient and summary statistics for work area EC,
a one standard deviation increase above average work area levels will lead to an increase in
estimated personal exposures of 32.7% in the shop and 79% in the dock. The predicted value
of EC exposures for smokers to non-smokers increases more modestly by 19% when work area
exposures are held constant.
Area Exposure
(log(WorkAreaECjk) = β20 + β21(Terminal Sizek) + β22(P&Dk) + β23 (Shopk)+
β24(Ventilationjk)+ β25log(YardECk) + β26(Jobjk)+ γijk) Work area exposure to EC is predicted
by terminal characteristics, work location (dock or shop), indoor ventilation, and background
concentrations observed in the yard (R2=0.64).
The choice of the three variables representing terminal characteristics (terminal size, P&D, and
Shop) were the result of a principal components analysis (PCA) that used the larger set of
terminal characteristics data to define three factors that could more efficiently describe the
variability of the dataset (Discussion A-2, Table A-3, Supporting Information). These PCA
factors were used both as covariates (Table A-6, Supporting Information), as well as to identify
important individual variables for inclusion in the model. The PCA results identified terminal
size and equipment, P&D activities, and shop activities, as the primary factors driving the
complete set of terminal characteristics, and yard size, number of P&D drivers, and number of
mechanics were chosen as representative of these factors and incorporated into the current
equation describing work area particle exposures. The results were similar for both the PCA
factors and three specific terminal characteristics variables. A one standard deviation rise in
yard size increases work area EC concentrations by 12.6%, while the effect of P&D drivers is
much smaller at 3.7% (number of mechanics was not statistically significant).
Another factor in the determination of work area concentrations are the ventilation rates or the
degree of closure of the buildings where the source activity is occurring, as measured by an
interaction term between job location and outdoor temperature levels. This covariate for the
winter closure effect significantly predicts that work area EC is 57.1% lower in the warmer
versus colder outdoor temperatures in the shop, with a negligible effect on the dock.
The indoor work area particle concentrations are also affected by background levels in and
around the terminal locations, as captured by the yard monitors placed at the perimeter of the
properties. Based on the model, a one standard deviation rise in background concentrations
detected in the yard significantly increases the predicted work area EC levels by 78.8%. Also,
the large differential between shop and dock exposures are in line with expectations, and the
results show that area exposures are over 700% higher in the shop than the dock.
Background Exposure
(log(YardOC)= β30 + β31(Relative Humidity) + β32(Temperature) + β33(Windspeed) +
β34(Interstate) + β35(Industrial) + β3(6–9)(4 Regional Dummies) + ηijk) Background particle
levels at the terminal locations were observed in the yard, which is located away from and
upwind of regular work activities. These background concentrations were consistently less
than the work area and personal levels. They are significantly predicted by a number of weather
conditions, as well as location-specific factors such as the distance to the road and the percent
of industrial activity nearby (R2=0.51).

The percent of land characterized as industrial or commercial within a one kilometer radius is
significant in the model, where a one standard deviation increase above the mean is followed
by a 28.1% increase in the amount of EC observed in the terminal yard. A dichotomous variable
representing a cutoff distance of 500 meters from an interstate is a significant predictor of
background EC levels, and yard concentrations are 35.1% higher at terminals located closer
to an interstate.
Relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed are included in the final model to control for
weather effects on pollution dispersal and dilution, all of which have a negative impact on
predicted background exposure levels. In particular, a one standard deviation rise in relative
humidity decreases predicted background EC by 7.9%, while the same effect represents a
decline of 9.2% for temperature, and 45.5% for wind speed. These weather relationships are
likely to be strongly effected by the unique composition of EC source activity in our work
environments, and for that reason differ from previous studies of small particles at roadways
(29). Precipitation was excluded from the model due to lack of variability – 80% of sampling
sessions had no precipitation and over 90% experienced less than a tenth of an inch.
Finally, the Census designations show significant differences in background EC levels across
regions of the US. The constant term is excluded from the background equation because all
four regional dummies are represented (p-values test the hypothesis stated as “the constant for
region x is zero”), with the result that each regional coefficient is a multiplicative constant
elevating background exposures to various degrees above the hypothetical zero scenario. The
biggest regional impact on background EC exposure levels at trucking terminals is the South
(2.94), followed by the Northeast (2.32), the West (1.97) and finally the Midwest (1.67).
Organic Carbon and PM2.5
Although the EC component of PM2.5 is used as the primary measure of combustion particle
exposure at the terminal locations, PM2.5 and the OC component were also evaluated. The
concentrations for these two measures were analyzed using the same type of model developed
to predict EC and results are provided in Supporting Information, Tables A-4 and A-5. The
SEM outcomes are similar for most of the predictors, although the coefficient estimates
changed somewhat. The effect of temperature on OC was opposite that for EC, likely reflecting
the increased rate of chemical reactions for organic vapors in the atmosphere, which lead to
more formation of condensation aerosol (30,31). Also, the smoking effect is much higher for
OC and PM2.5, where smoker exposures are 70% and 72% higher than nonsmoker exposures,
respectively (compared to 19% for EC). This is consistent with the large OC content in cigarette
smoke, whereas EC is only a small fraction of cigarette smoke (18).
Another major difference between the particle exposure models is the percent of variability
explained by each equation. In particular, the equations for personal and work area exposures
explain more of the variability in these exposure measurements (R2 equals 0.64 for both), with
less variability explained in the background equation (R2=0.51). The opposite is true for OC
and PM2.5, with a large percent of variability left unexplained by the personal and work area
equations (Personal R2: OC=0.32, PM2.5=0.43; Area R2: OC=0.25, PM2.5=0.27), with little
variability left unexplained in the background equation (Background R2: OC=0.92,
PM2.5=0.91). In other words, personal and work area exposure to EC is more highly predicted
by on-site work related exposures to vehicle emissions, while it is more difficult to predict
personal exposure to OC and PM2.5 based on the same modeling approach. However, the
variability in background OC and PM2.5 is almost completely described by the model, in
contrast to the identical background model for EC. Although the background R2 values for the
SEMs are very high for OC and PM2.5, it would be useful to further refine the model beyond
the regional dummy variables in order describe individual characteristics within regions that
drive these differences.

Discussion
The statistical modeling approach presented here provides a new alternative to modeling
environmental and occupational health data. The complicated three-tiered sampling scheme –
personal measurements from individuals, indoor measurements in work areas, and background
measurements in a nearby outdoor location – requires a statistical approach that can handle
high dimensional data and complex covariance structures. This type of study design of multiple
and simultaneous within site measurements at a given study location (indoor and outdoor) is
common in environmental health research, and the SEM approach presented in this paper
should provide a useful alternative to exposure modeling in these settings.
The modeling results suggest a number of interesting trends. Overall, personal exposures are
found to depend primarily on the work area concentrations of the individual monitored, and to
a lesser extent their smoking status. They are also indirectly determined by terminal
characteristics and activities, ventilation in the work areas, job location, and the background
particle conditions. These background conditions will impact observed personal concentrations
via increasing or decreasing work area exposure levels, and can be accounted for in large part
by characteristics specific to local areas such as nearby pollution sources and weather
conditions.
The model works quite well in explaining extreme values that are still within the relevant range
of the collected exposure data. In the personal EC regression equation, the largest and smallest
predicted values from the model are within the range of observed values at the high and low
ends of the distribution. The same is the case for the other equations, including those for OC
and PM2.5. These results provide further evidence in favor of the SEM approach, as well as
support the use of lognormal transformations of the exposure variables.
If we instead assumed limited correlation across sampling locations (personal, work area, and
background) and no directionality in the effect of covariates on exposure (Figure A-4,
Supporting Information), these different sampling components could be broken down into their
individual effects and a standard additive linear model applied to predict personal exposures.
An examination of the differences between these two approaches provides much support for
the SEM method, and the results from ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of EC personal
concentrations (including all covariates) are provided in Supporting Information, Table A-7.
Although this approach explains a high percentage of variability among personal EC exposures
(R2=0.71), all of the coefficients are smaller (with the exception of smoking), dampening their
estimated impact on personal exposure levels predicted by the SEM approach. This
underestimation of effect sizes would be expected given that the OLS approach does not
account for either the correlation among exposure measurements or the directionality of the
covariate effects on the individual equations (i.e., weather and background conditions impact
personal exposure indirectly thru elevating work area particle concentrations). Furthermore,
in the OLS model, temperature, relative humidity, distance to road, and regional differences
are no longer significant predictors of exposure, while the coefficient for the number of P&D
drivers changes sign. These types of changes in regression output are common when there is
a high degree of correlation among model covariates, with some of the covariates endogenous,
or predicted within the system. The use of the OLS approach in this scenario would under
predict personal exposure (with important implications for the epidemiologic model relying
on these estimates), the results of which lend strong support to the use of SEM methods over
OLS to estimate exposures in this type of setting. We are currently working to address the
theoretical and methodological implications of SEMs in exposure assessment modeling, and
plan to further test this approach in settings such as the railroad industry.

An important implication of the model concerns the size of the cigarette smoking effect, since
we will have limited data on the smoking habits of each individual in the cohort for the
epidemiologic study. The results from the EC analysis suggest that both work area
concentrations and smoking status are significant predictors of personal exposure to particles.
However, although the coefficient for smoking is statistically significant, its impact on personal
exposure to EC is small by comparison with the impact of work area EC levels. Furthermore,
excluding smoking status from the model does not significantly change the predictive value of
the personal EC equation – the R2 declines slightly to 0.62 (from 0.64) and all other variables
remain significant predictors. This is not the case for OC or PM2.5, where the smoking effect
explains a much higher percentage of the variability in personal exposure to these particles.
Therefore, as long as EC remains the primary marker of diesel and other combustion particle
exposures in this study, information on smoking status is not pivotal to obtaining accurate
estimates of historical exposure levels.
Another interesting result of the model concerns the differences in predictability across
exposure equations and particle components. A high percentage of variability in personal EC
exposure was predicted by individual and work area characteristics (personal R2=0.64; work
area R2=0.64), while less of the variability in PM2.5 and OC exposures were explained by
work related exposures compared to background exposures (work area R2: OC=0.25,
PM2.5=0.27; yard background R2: OC=0.93, PM2.5=0.91). These results would appear to
reinforce the choice of EC as our primary marker of on-site personal exposure to diesel and
vehicular particles, since the equations related to diesel exposure in the work environment were
more important in explaining EC than either OC or PM2.5. In other words, the model suggests
that EC is more highly predicted by the work area environments at each trucking terminal,
while PM2.5 and OC are better explained by background conditions at each location. Since
PM2.5 is a predictor of cancer risk from urban air pollution, this difference between PM2.5
and EC will also allow us to determine the relative contributions to cancer risk for PM2.5 and
EC, which has important implications for prevention strategies. Note that the high OC levels
relative to EC suggests that idling and lightly loaded diesels and perhaps some car emissions
were the predominant sources of EC in the terminal work environments, which is also supported
by source apportionment data that is being reported elsewhere.
The current model of exposure will set the stage for developing a model for the historical
extrapolation of exposures for the epidemiologic study, linking cumulative lifetime exposures
with lung cancer outcomes in the cohort of trucking industry employees. However, knowledge
of the current work environment will need to be supplemented with historical data on policy
and regulatory changes in the industry, as well as economic fluctuations in business activity
levels that impact exposure levels across time. For example, since the late 1980s when the last
large exposure assessment of the industry occurred (18), the EPA has strengthened heavy-duty
diesel truck engine standards multiple times, from 0.60 g/bhp-hr in 1990 to 0.10 g/bhp-hr in
1998. These changes have certainly impacted exposure levels at these locations and a thorough
review of their effects is essential to an accurate historical extrapolation of particle exposures.
We are also working on establishing a link between macroeconomic trends and particle
exposures at these locations that will aid in estimating historical exposure levels. The trucking
industry is highly susceptible to economy-wide fluctuations in business activity, and the current
model identifies a significant and positive association between terminal-specific activity levels
(terminal size and number of drivers) and particle exposure. We will use economic trend data
to estimate historical exposure levels to particles, with the assumption that economic recessions
and booms will have a direct impact on activity levels at the terminals (trucks coming in and
out, forklift activity, maintenance activity, nearby traffic patterns, etc.), and a subsequent
indirect effect on personal exposure to combustion particles.

Abstract
A prominent vector of aquatic invasive species to coastal regions is the discharge of water, sediments, and bioﬁlm from ships’ ballast-
water tanks. During eight years of studying ships arriving to the lower Chesapeake Bay, we developed an understanding of the mech-
anisms by which invasive microorganisms might arrive to the region via ships. Within a given ship, habitats included ballast water,
unpumpable water and sediment (collectively known as residuals), and bioﬁlms formed on internal surfaces of ballast-water tanks.
We sampled 69 vessels arriving from foreign and domestic ports, largely from Western Europe, the Mediterranean region, and the
US East and Gulf coasts. All habitats contained bacteria and viruses. By extrapolating the measured concentration of a microbial metric
to the estimated volume of ballast water, bioﬁlm, or residual sediment and water within an average vessel, we calculated the potential
total number of microorganisms contained by each habitat, thus creating a hierarchy of risk of delivery. The estimated concentration of
microorganisms was greatest in ballast water  sediment and water residuals  bioﬁlms. From these results, it is clear microorganisms
may be transported within ships in a variety of ways. Using temperature tolerance as a measure of survivability and the temperature
diﬀerence between ballast-water samples and the water into which the ballast water was discharged, we estimated 56% of microorganisms
could survive in the lower Bay. Extrapolated delivery and survival of microorganisms to the Port of Hampton Roads in lower Chesa-
peake Bay shows on the order of 1020 microorganisms (6.8 · 1019 viruses and 3.9 · 1018 bacteria cells) are discharged annually to the
region.

1. Why study microorganisms?
In the context of invasive species, the reasons for inves-
tigating the transfer of aquatic microorganisms, including
viruses, bacteria, protists, and microalgae are threefold:
their high densities in natural waters, ability to form resting
stages, and potential toxicity or pathogenicity. Aquatic
microorganisms are orders of magnitude more abundant
than macroorganisms such as copepods and ﬁsh: naturally
occurring bacteria and viruses are found in concentrations
on the order of 106–1011 l1 (e.g., Ducklow and Shiah,
1993; Proctor, 1997; Fuhrman, 1999; Wommack and Col-
well, 2000). Given such high densities, microorganisms are
transferred and introduced globally via ships in greater
numbers than any other size class of organisms. Nearly all
such
microorganisms,
incidentally,
are
innocuous
to
humans. Instead, the viruses infect naturally occurring bac-
terial and phytoplankton hosts, in which they can cause sig-
niﬁcant mortality (Fuhrman and Noble, 1996; Suttle, 2005).
Once released, microorganisms are well poised to be
invasive species. They are small, a size that facilitates their
passive dispersal. They appear to have simpler requirements
for survival than do metazoans, based upon their ubiquity
in the biosphere, including extreme environments (Deming,
1997). They predominantly reproduce asexually and grow

rapidly, factors also contributing to their widespread distri-
bution. Finally, life cycles of many invertebrate metazoans
and unicellular organisms such as bacteria, eukaryotic phy-
toplankton (including toxic dinoﬂagellates), and other pro-
tist species, include resting stages (variously called cysts,
spores, auxospores, ephippia, or resting eggs according to
taxon) capable of surviving prolonged periods of unfavor-
able conditions (e.g., Bailey et al., 2003).
These resting stages are typically produced at very low
frequency, if at all, under favorable conditions, and at high
frequency when environmental conditions deteriorate (e.g.,
declining nutrient concentrations, shortened photoperiod,
or reduced food quality; Blackburn and Parker, 2005). Pro-
duction of resting stages ensures long-term viability of the
population because they are extremely resistant to adverse
conditions, including anoxia, exposure to noxious chemi-
cals, freezing, and passage through digestive tracts of ﬁsh
and waterfowl. Resting eggs of invertebrates and cysts of
dinoﬂagellates are usually negatively buoyant and sink
when released or formed. Resting stages may remain viable
in sediments in a virtual suspended metabolic state for dec-
ades or even centuries (Hairston et al., 1995) and can germi-
nate under a combination of favorable light, temperature,
and other environmental conditions (e.g., Kremp and
Anderson, 2000; Itakura and Yamaguchi, 2001; Figueroa
et al., 2006).
Pathogenic or toxic aquatic bacteria, viruses, protists,
and microalgae can have devastating eﬀects on ecosystems
and economic resources. There are well-studied pathogen–
host systems among many aquatic phyla; for example,
viruses terminating algal blooms (e.g., Milligan and Cosper,
1994; Nagasaki et al., 1994; Van Etten et al., 1991; Short
and Suttle, 2002), viruses infecting seals (e.g., Osterhaus
et al., 1985; Grachev et al., 1989), and protists decimating
seagrass beds (e.g., Muehlstein, 1992; Ralph and Short,
2002). Furthermore, the apparent increasing frequency
and distribution of toxic microalgal blooms has received
much attention in the past two decades (see reviews by Hal-
legraeﬀ, 1993; CENR, 2000). Given marine pathogens can
spread locally much more quickly than terrestrial pathogens
(even when instances of obvious human intervention are
excluded, McCallum et al., 2003), and considering the rela-
tively fast transport by ships, the threat of global dispersal
of aquatic pathogens appears more immediate than the
threat of invasion by other groups of organisms.
Thus, by virtue of their abundance, life-history charac-
teristics, and potential pathogenicity or toxicity, microor-
ganisms possess a great capacity to invade and cause
detrimental eﬀects in new environments. This paper will
explore the extent and potential consequences of bacteria
and virus transport within ships.
2. Types of habitats within ships
Microorganisms can be found in several locations within
a ship—ballast water, residual sediment and water, and
bioﬁlms formed on interior tanks surfaces—each of which
will be considered separately. Transfer among these habi-
tats has not been fully explored (although see Meyer
et al., 2000). We do not consider microorganisms within
hull fouling communities in this review.
2.1. Ballast water
Ships’ ballast waters are the best investigated of these
habitats. Although water has been used regularly as ballast
since the 1880s (Carlton, 1985), the transfer of organisms
by ballast-water discharge was investigated only sporadi-
cally until the late 1980s. The interest in ballast water at
that time stemmed largely from the dramatic ecological
and economic impacts of introduced species, such as comb
jellies (Mnemiopsis leidyi) in the Black Sea and zebra mus-
sels (Dreissena polymorpha) in the North American Great
Lakes (International Maritime Organization, 1999). Much
of the work on ballast invaders has been dedicated to
studying metazoans (Fofonoﬀet al., 2003), despite the high
densities of naturally occurring microorganisms in aquatic
environments. To test the hypothesis that vast quantities of
bacteria and viruses are carried in ships’ ballast tanks, Ruiz
et al. (2000) quantiﬁed their abundance in ballast water of
vessels arriving to Chesapeake Bay from foreign ports.
Indeed, the numbers were high: mean abundances of
8.3 · 108 bacteria l1
and
7.4 · 109
virus-like
particles
(VLPs) l1 were documented.
2.2. Sediment and water residuals
We now know ships declaring no (pumpable) ballast on
board may also serve as vectors. Concerns about no ballast
on board (NOBOB) invasions have risen from a position of
relative obscurity a few years ago to one of the chief envi-
ronmental concerns in the Great Lakes basin today (e.g.,
Grigorovich et al., 2003). The potential for NOBOB-med-
iated invasions lies within tanks’ muddy puddles; residuals
of sediment and water can contain an assortment of meta-
zoans and microorganisms, including resting stages (e.g.,
Hallegraeﬀand Bolch, 1992; Galil and Hu¨lsmann, 1997;
Gollasch et al., 1998; Hamer et al., 2000). When NOBOB
tanks are later ﬁlled with ballast water, the accumulated
sediment (and associated biota) may be resuspended and
discharged immediately or at subsequent ports of call.
Sediment accumulation can be appreciable, depending
on elapsed time since the ship was last dry-docked. For
example, double-bottom ballast tanks of a cargo vessel
contained up to 30 cm of sediment after only two years
of use (Hamer et al., 2000). While circumstances vary from
ship to ship, the unpumpable water that remains in most
vessels, together with any residual sediment, potentially
harbors nonindigenous organisms. A metastudy of 13
European studies recorded 990 species in a combination
of ballast water and sediment samples (Gollasch et al.,
2002). Furthermore, Kelly (1993) reported Japanese ships
visiting the USA carried viable cysts and spores of nonin-
digenous species after 11–15 days’ voyage. Finally, Mac-
334
L.A. Drake et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 55 (2007) 333–341
Isaac et al. (2002) modeled NOBOB vessel-mediated inoc-
ulation of the Great Lakes using available plankton densi-
ties in coastal European waters, ship transit times, species’
survival curves, and residual ballast volumes; individual
NOBOB vessels potentially discharge >107 individuals of
rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods, and 1011 bacteria,
depending on conditions inside ballast tanks.
In this regard, tank sediments serve as a repository for
particles, living or otherwise, that settle from water within
the tank. With respect to issues of invasions, therefore, sed-
iment and water residuals in a NOBOB tank will contain a
temporally integrated assortment of organisms found in
the water columns that overlay it days and weeks earlier,
and possibly months and years earlier, in the case of resting
stages of organisms.
2.3. Bioﬁlms on ballast-water tank surfaces
Aquatic surfaces are colonized to some degree with
bioﬁlms, organic matrices that can contain bacteria, micro-
algae, and associated protists, sometimes including patho-
genic forms (e.g., Decho, 1990, 2000). Microorganisms in
mature bioﬁlms are notoriously resistant to chemical disin-
fectants for reasons that have yet to be satisfactorily
explained (Costerton et al., 1999). The production of exo-
polymer secretions, ‘‘slimes’’, by surface-bound bacteria is
a well-recognized—but insuﬃcient—mechanism to explain
such resistance to chemical treatment. Confocal microscopy
and other tools have demonstrated the complicated, heter-
ogeneous architecture of thick bioﬁlms (many as thick as
hundreds of micrometers, Baier, 1984; Cook et al., 2000).
In addition to providing a chemical barrier to potentially
lethal agents, bioﬁlms might also provide refuge for bacteria
from predatory protists (Hu¨lsmann et al., 2000) or promote
interactions among pathogenic bacteria and protist grazers
such that evolutionarily successful pathogens survive diges-
tion by protists or become their endosymbionts (Barker and
Brown, 1994).
For these reasons, it is worthwhile to consider ships’ bal-
last-water bioﬁlms, but there are only two such reports.
First, bioﬁlm communities formed on multiple types of arti-
ﬁcial surfaces deployed in a ballast tank during a trans-
oceanic voyage (Meyer et al., 2000). When the substrata
and associated bioﬁlms were removed and submerged in
artiﬁcial seawater, they seeded secondary bioﬁlms, which
survived for years (Meyer et al., 2000). Second, bacteria
and VLPs have been enumerated in bioﬁlms collected from
ships arriving to Chesapeake Bay and the Great Lakes.
Microbial concentrations were up to ten times greater
than those in ballast water, and some samples contained
potentially harmful bacteria and microalgae (Drake et al.,
2005).
3. Ship-borne microbial transport: case studies
Here we consider examples of ship-borne microbial
transport, discharge, and subsequent deleterious eﬀect.
First in most such litanies is the introduction of toxic dino-
ﬂagellates to Australia (Hallegraeﬀet al., 1988; Hallegraeﬀ,
1998). Upon commencement of woodchip export from
southern Tasmania to Japan and South Korea, the previ-
ously undetected toxic dinoﬂagellate Gymnodinium catena-
tum was likely introduced to Tasmania (McMinn et al.,
1997). It is impossible to say ships’ ballast water was
responsible for the translocation, but the evidence to that
eﬀect is compelling. First, the large, chain-forming dinoﬂa-
gellate and associated human poisonings were previously
unknown in this area prior to the opening of the woodchip
mill. Second, radioisotope dating of sediment cores shows
the appearance of the dinoﬂagellate’s cysts coincident with
the beginning of woodchip export (McMinn et al., 1997).
This species is now well established in the Derwent and
Huon estuaries, and high concentrations of paralytic shell-
ﬁsh toxins in shellﬁsh have caused regular closure of aqua-
culture farms there.
A second example of probable microbial transport by
ships is the oft-cited discovery of the bacterium Vibrio chol-
erae, agent of human cholera, in ships arriving to ports in
the Gulf of Mexico (McCarthy and Khambaty, 1994). Dur-
ing routine monitoring of shellﬁsh and ﬁsh in the Gulf, an
epidemic-causing strain of V. cholerae, serotype O139, pre-
viously unreported in the Gulf, was detected (DePaola
et al., 1992). At the time, an epidemic caused by V. cholerae
O139 was underway in South America. When ships with
last ports of call in South America were sampled in Mobile
Bay, Alabama, their ballast water contained the epidemic
strain of cholera. Subsequent testing showed it to be indis-
tinguishable from the strain found in Gulf ﬁsh and shellﬁsh
(McCarthy et al., 1992). Although no illnesses were
reported in the US from this strain, the incidents illustrate
the potential for ships to transport—and, importantly, deli-
ver—viable, toxic bacteria.
Lastly, there are a growing number of data sets illustrat-
ing the transport of potentially toxic microorganisms by
ships. Organized by broad taxonomic groups, they include:
bacteria, such as V. cholerae (e.g., Knight et al., 1999;
Zo et al., 1999; Ruiz et al., 2000) and Vibrio spp. (Mimura
et al., 2005); autotrophic protists (e.g., Hallegraeﬀand
Bolch, 1992; McCollin et al., 2000; Doblin et al., in
press); and heterotrophic protists (e.g., Galil and Hu¨ls-
mann, 1997).
4. Can free-living microorganisms be invaders?
Biogeographical considerations
Except for spectacular examples provided by highly
infectious pathogens (see review in McCallum et al.,
2004), the invasion biology of aquatic microorganisms is
not as well understood as those of vertebrates, macroinver-
tebrates, and macroalgae. In general, many members of the
latter groups have biogeography, i.e., their distribution is
speciﬁc to certain geographical areas. If we assume, how-
ever, free-living microorganisms have no biogeography
and are global in their distribution, as some researchers
L.A. Drake et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 55 (2007) 333–341
335
contend (e.g., Finlay, 2002; Finlay and Fenchel, 2004), then
they cannot be considered to ‘‘invade’’ environments. This
topic is explored with respect to ship-borne microorgan-
isms by Dobbs and Rogerson (2005). We will not reiterate
their arguments here, but in short, they contend resolution
of the microbial-ubiquity hypothesis is highly relevant to
considerations of ballast management.
5. Methods to determine numbers of microorganisms,
estimate their survival, and calculate the total number of
microorganisms delivered
5.1. Relative propagule pressure among habitats
Propagule pressure (i.e., the number of individuals
introduced into a given environment) is understood as a
prime factor explaining the success of an invasion (see
Occhipinti–Ambrogi in this volume). Furthermore, the
concentration of microorganisms in ballast waters has been
considered a proxy for propagule pressure in most studies
and for devising microbiological standards for ballast
water treatment. We know, however, there are microorgan-
isms in ballast-tank sediments and bioﬁlms. How might
these other microbiological repositories ﬁgure into treat-
ment strategies and regulatory policy? To address the
question, we calculated the number of microorganisms
contained within each ballast-tank habitat (ballast water,
bioﬁlm, and residual sediment and water) to create a
numerical hierarchy based on potential delivery of micro-
organisms. We extrapolated the average concentrations
of microorganisms within ships sampled to their estimated
concentrations within a so-called ‘‘average’’ vessel. We
considered our average vessel to be a bulk carrier, because
most ballast-tank microbiology has been gleaned from
such ships, they contain the largest volume of ballast water
compared to other ship types, and they are highly abun-
dant in the world ﬂeet and therefore representative.
The dynamics of bioﬁlm detachment from ballast-tank
walls remain uninvestigated, as do the dynamics of residu-
als’ resuspension and entrainment into ballast water.
Therefore, the calculations below relate to the number of
microorganisms within each ballast-tank habitat prior to
ballast discharge at a receiving port.
Between 1996 and 2003, we sampled bulk carriers and
colliers (coal-carrying ships) arriving to the lower and
upper Chesapeake Bay from foreign and domestic ports,
largely from Western Europe, the Mediterranean region,
and the US East and Gulf coasts. Data sources for esti-
mates of microbial concentrations are described in Table
1. Despite the large number of ballast-water samples col-
lected for microbial enumeration (n = 31 for VLPs, 53 for
bacteria), there was little if any replication for a given
port/season combination, so data were not analyzed by
combination. Likewise, the number of vessels sampled for

residuals or bioﬁlms precluded analysis by port/season
combination.
For a complete description of ﬁeld and laboratory meth-
ods, see Drake et al. (2001, 2005). Brieﬂy, ﬁeld samples
were collected as follows: ballast-water samples were col-
lected by hand or using a bleached Niskin bottle and dis-
pensed into sterile containers. Because residual samples
consisted of sediment and a layer of overlaying water, both
fractions were collected independently and aseptically into
sterile containers. Finally, bioﬁlm samples on ballast tank
surfaces were scraped from an area of known dimensions
with a sterile polystyrene scraper, and the scraper with
attached material was placed in a sterile container. In all
cases, samples were transported from vessel to laboratory
in a cooler.
In the laboratory, bacteria were enumerated using the
nucleic acid stain DAPI (40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole;
Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri; Porter
and Feig, 1980) or by ﬂow cytometery using PicoGreen
(Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oregon; Veldhuis et al.,
1997). VLPs were visualized and enumerated with the
nucleic acid stains YO-PROTM-1 (Hennes and Suttle,
1995) or SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene,
Oregon; Noble and Fuhrman, 1998). When diﬀerent meth-
ods were used, an intercalibration was conducted to ensure
data from both methods could be pooled for analysis. Sta-
tistical analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows
Release 11.0.1.
Most of the vessels sampled for ballast water had under-
gone open ocean exchange prior to sampling (70% of ves-
sels sampled for bacteria analysis, 77% of vessels sampled
for VLP analysis). Because there were no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ences between mean bacteria or VLP concentrations in
exchanged vs. unexchanged tanks (Mann–Whitney U-test,
p = 0.69 for bacteria and 0.345 for VLPs), samples from
both types of vessels were pooled to calculate average
microbial concentrations. Bioﬁlm and residual samples
inherently represent an amalgamation of previous ballast-
ing operations, so their prior condition as exchanged or
unexchanged was not considered in these analyses.
To determine the average quantity of ballast water and
residual volume present in a bulk carrier, vessel oﬃcers were
interviewed. In the case of residual volume, vessel captains
did not partition unpumpable ballast between sediment
and overlying water. Based on personal observations, the
majority of residual volume was sediment, so residual
volume was apportioned as 80% sediment and 20% overly-
ing water. The microbial abundance of each fraction was
calculated, and the two were added to determine the total
microbial abundance in the residual volume. The ﬁnal num-
ber underestimates the total residual abundance because
microorganisms attached to sediment grains or meiofauna
were not removed and counted. Instead, the microbial com-
ponent of sediment residuals was measured by enumerating
microorganisms in sediment pore water. Pore water was
analyzed after it was expressed from sediment samples by
centrifugation at 1000g at 4 C for 10 min in a Marathon
2100R centrifuge (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Hampton, New Hamp-
shire). The volume of pore water contained in an average
sediment residual volume was 38% (SD = 14%, n = 10 with
up to four subsamples per sample).
The amount of bioﬁlm on ballast tank walls was deter-
mined by multiplying the average surface area of the tanks
and the thickness of aquatic bioﬁlms (Table 1). Field sam-
pling showed only a small portion of the tanks’ surfaces
were covered by bioﬁlm, so the calculations include a tank
area coverage of 10%.
5.2. Survival success of discharged microorganisms
Once organisms are delivered to a new location, their
invasion success is a function of their ability to survive
and reproduce (Carlton, 1985). With respect to microor-
ganisms, little is known in this regard. One proxy of sur-
vival used for invertebrates determines the hydrographic
match between the ballast water and receiving (pier side)
waters (e.g., Smith et al., 1999). We used this model and
estimated the percentage of vessels arriving to lower Ches-
apeake Bay that encounter optimum temperature condi-
tions for microorganisms upon ballast-water discharge.
Using empirical data from ships arriving to the lower
Bay, we calculated temperature diﬀerences between ballast
water and receiving waters and then applied assumptions
about bacteria temperature tolerances. Our discussion is
limited to ballast water because the dynamics of sediment
and bioﬁlm discharge are more complex; that is, the
amount of sediment and bioﬁlm discharged by a vessel will
depend on vessel type, operations, tank history, and char-
acteristics of the tank habitats themselves.
Thirty-two commercial ships were boarded in the Port
of Hampton Roads, Virginia, which encompasses ship ter-
minals in the lower Chesapeake Bay cities of Norfolk,
Newport News, Portsmouth, and Chesapeake. The vessels
arrived from foreign and domestic ports, largely from Wes-
tern Europe, the Mediterranean region, and the US East
and Gulf coasts between 1999 and 2003. Most vessels
(72%, 23 of 32) had undergone open ocean exchange. Tem-
perature was measured in surface water samples of ballast
tanks and surface water collected adjacent to the vessel
pier.
First, we considered the tolerance of microorganisms.
Assuming bacteria have a temperature tolerance range of
30 C (Madigan et al., 2003) and they inhabit ballast water
at the midpoint of that range, then they can tolerate dis-
charge into water ±15 C that of the ballast water. Second,
we considered the optimum temperature conditions. If bac-
teria have a 10 C temperature range for optimum growth
(Madigan et al., 2003), and if they inhabit ballast water at
the midpoint of their optimal range, then they will grow
best when discharged into receiving water ±5 C that of
the ballast water. We have simply and conservatively
assumed virus tolerances and optima reﬂect those of bacte-
ria. Furthermore, our use of the term ‘‘surviving viruses’’ is
L.A. Drake et al. / Marine Pollution Bulletin 55 (2007) 333–341
337
merely for ease of reading; we appreciate the fundamen-
tally diﬀerent nature of viruses compared to bacteria.
5.3. Total number of surviving bacteria and VLPs delivered
to the Port of Hampton Roads
Because the number of microorganisms contained in
ballast water is far greater than in residuals or bioﬁlms
(see Section 6), these calculations used ballast water only.
To determine the amount of ballast water released annually
in the port, we multiplied the volume of ballast-water dis-
charged per vessel type by the frequency of vessel arrivals
(Table 2). By interviewing ships’ oﬃcers onboard colliers
and container ships, we determined the average volume
of ballast-water discharged in port by those vessel types.
However, for bulk carriers, we obtained data solely
describing ballast water capacity. Assuming their ballasting
operations are similar to colliers (a type of bulk carrier), we
calculated bulk carriers’ ballast-water discharge using the
same percentage (65% of total ballast water capacity;
SD = 28%; n = 85 colliers boarded in Hampton Roads
between 1998 and 2003). Thus, we estimated the volume
of ballast-water discharged annually from colliers, bulk
carriers, and container ships. Together, these three types
of vessels represented 85% of the vessel arrivals to the port
over the 77-week tracking period.
Next, combining (1) the volume of ballast-water dis-
charged in port, (2) the density of microorganisms in bal-
last water, and (3) the estimated survival of discharged
microorganisms, we calculated the total number of micro-
organisms annually discharged from ships’ ballast water
and surviving in the Port of Hampton Roads (Table 2).
6. Results
6.1. Diﬀerences in propagule density among habitats within
an average bulk carrier
In every ship sampled, all habitats contained viruses and
bacteria, but the concentrations of microorganisms varied
over 1000-fold among habitats. Per ship, the total number
of bacteria was 7.4 · 1012 (within the bioﬁlm habitat),
6.8 · 1014 (residuals = sum of bacteria in sediment pore
water and overlying water), and 1.5 · 1016 (ballast water);
corresponding VLP numbers were 7.1 · 1014 (bioﬁlm),
3.1 · 1016 (residuals), and 2.6 · 1017 (ballast water) (data
not shown). In sum, the potential delivery of microorgan-
isms was greatest in ballast water  sediment and water
residuals  bioﬁlms.
6.2. Survival success of discharged microorganisms
The diﬀerence between the temperature of ballast water
and the pier side water ranged from 13 to 2.5 C. Vessels
with exchanged ballast water (23 vessels) had temperature
diﬀerences that spanned the entire range; for vessels with
unexchanged water, the range was 6 to 2 C (nine ves-
sels). We tested whether a signiﬁcant diﬀerence existed
between vessels with exchanged and unexchanged ballast
water. If there were a diﬀerence, it would indicate—
using this analysis—that one group of microorganisms
(exchanged or unexchanged) would have a greater surviv-
ability, and therefore, a greater chance of invading the
waters where discharged. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀer-
ence, however, in the average temperature diﬀerence
between exchanged or unexchanged ballast water and the
water sampled pier side (5.7 C, exchanged; 2.8 C, unex-
changed, T-test, p > 0.05).
If microorganisms tolerate water ±15 C that of the bal-
last water, then these data show 100% (32 of 32) of ships
sampled contained microorganisms that could tolerate
the new environment upon delivery (Fig. 1). If microorgan-
isms grow optimally at temperatures ±5 C of the ballast
water, then 56% (18 of 32) of ships sampled contained
microorganisms that encountered optimum temperatures
in the receiving waters (Fig. 1).

water discharge in the Port of Hampton Roads
Assuming 56% survival (as above) and applying esti-
mates of ship traﬃc (Table 2), then the total number of

7. Conclusions
In the past century, global shipping has increased with
respect to the number and size of ships; thus, the volume
of ballast water transported has increased as well. We
hypothesize this increased inoculation of microorganisms
has had ecological or economic impact, and case studies
of V. cholerae and toxic dinoﬂagellates demonstrate some
potential consequences of microorganisms’ release by
ships. As economies expand and the number of ships in
the world ﬂeet increases, dissemination of microorganisms
will in all likelihood grow. Also, as global sea surface tem-
perature is expected to rise, tropical diseases—including
water-borne ones—may enlarge their geographic distribu-
tion (Pascual et al., 2000, although see Rogers and Ran-
dolph, 2000). Thus, not only do we expect delivery of
microorganisms to the world’s ports to escalate, but release
of potential pathogens may increase as well.
From a numerical standpoint, these results show far
more bacteria and viruses were contained in ballast water
compared to residuals and bioﬁlms. Thus, treatment
options should ﬁrst target the ballast-water fraction of
ship-borne microorganisms. We acknowledge our residual
and bioﬁlm calculations are likely underestimates of the
microbial
community,
because
attached
bacteria
and
viruses were not enumerated. However, we must assume
only a fraction of residual and bioﬁlm volume (and their
associated microorganisms) is resuspended and discharged
in a given port. Thus, a calculation of the microbial com-
munity contained within the entire volume of residual or
bioﬁlm in a ship is most likely an overestimate of the micro-
organisms to be discharged. Even so, residuals and bioﬁlms
contain high densities of microorganisms, including patho-
genic forms, and, at a minimum, should be addressed using
best management practices. The ongoing ‘invasional melt-
down’ (Simberloﬀand Von Holle, 1999) in the Great Lakes
illustrates the risk of biological invasions from vessels
carrying ‘‘only’’ sediment and water residuals.
The temperature mismatch between ballast water and
pier side water in the Port of Hampton Roads is not great
and suggests most bacteria (and presumably viruses) sur-
vive following ballast-water discharge; however, other vari-
ables must be considered with respect to their subsequent
survival and growth. Among them are the concentrations
of dissolved organic material (DOM) and nutrients, pH,
dissolved oxygen, density and feeding behavior of potential
predators, interactions with other members of the foodweb
in competition for resources, and salinity. The concentra-
tions of DOM and predators would need to be addressed
according to discharge site as they vary spatially on scales
that range from lm to km, and temporally from tides to
seasons. With respect to salinity, we are unaware of useful,
broad assumptions regarding microorganisms’ salinity tol-
erances and suggest evaluation on a case-by-case basis
using model microorganisms from freshwater, estuarine,
and oceanic environments. Additional variables to take
into account include microorganisms’ tolerances to abrupt
shifts in temperature and salinity, annual temperature
and salinity cycles in temperate ports, shipping patterns,
tank history, and concentrations of DOM in receiving
waters.
An estimated 1020 bacteria and viruses in ballast water
are annually delivered to and survive in the lower Chesa-
peake Bay. We recognize this calculation contains a number
of assumptions, and the biotic community will vary tempo-
rally and with changes in vessel routes, vessel history, vessel
type, season, length of voyage, and other factors (e.g.,
Verling et al., 2005). Nonetheless, to our knowledge, this
number is the ﬁrst estimate of annual microbial delivery
to a port.

Abstract 
The urban development that is now taking place globally has led to the most extensive permanent land use that 
has caused ecosystems to be destroyed and the depletion of natural resources. Today, about 50% of the world's 
population lives in urbanized cities and by 2030 it is estimated to be about 70%. The fact that we gather in larger 
numbers in cities means that we transport large volumes of resources to these areas, which gives rise to waste and 
emissions, which places a burden on the neighboring environment to the it’s limits. This leads to problems for both 
human health and society's economy, which is because the ecosystems that help us, collapse. To counter this, a 
better urban planning is required which includes the environment in society as ecosystem services. The problem 
with ecosystem services is that they do not have a commercial value, which makes it difficult to implement since 
they do not indicate any economic gain. Therefore, it is necessary to increase knowledge about how they contribute 
so that they can be correlated to how they contribute to society from three aspects: economic, social, 
environmental. 
 
Key words: Ecosystem services, Green Infrastructure, Urban planning, Urbanization 
 
Streszczenie 
Rozprzestrzenianie się miast, który odbywa się obecnie na całym świecie, doprowadziło do największego stałego 
zajęcia gruntów, oznaczającego zniszczenie ekosystemów i wyczerpywania się zasobów naturalnych. Obecnie 
około 50% światowej populacji mieszka w miastach  i szacuje się, że do 2030 r. będzie to około 70%. To, że 
gromadzimy się coraz liczniej w miastach, oznacza, że musimy transportować duże ilości zasobów do tych obsza-
rów, co powoduje powstawanie odpadów i emisji zanieczyszczeń, co obciąża sąsiadujące z  miastami środowisko 
do jego granic. Prowadzi to do powstawania problemów odnoszących się zarówno do ludzkiego zdrowia, jak i 
gospodarki społecznej, ponieważ ekosystemy, które mają nam pomagać, ulegają zniszczeniu. Aby temu przeciw-
działać, konieczne jest lepsze planowanie miast, które uwzględniałoby pełnione przez środowisko w społeczeń-
stwie usługi ekosystemowe. Problemem jest to, że takie usługi nie mają one wartości handlowej, co utrudnia ich 
uznanie, ponieważ nie wskazują na żadne korzyści ekonomiczne. Dlatego konieczne jest pogłębienie wiedzy na 
temat ich znaczenia, aby można było je skorelować z tym, jak służą społeczeństwu w trzech wymiarach: ekono-
micznym, społecznym i środowiskowym. 
 
Słowa kluczowe: usługi ekosystemowe, zielona infrastruktura, planowanie miast, urbanizacja
 
1. Introduction 
 
Over the past centuries, man has gone from living in 
smaller villages / cities to big cities, this phenome-
non  is  called  urbanization.  Globally,  urbanization  
 
has led to the most extensive permanent use of land 
surfaces and the change of its nearby green area (An-
dersson-Sköld et al., 2018). 
Today, about 50 percent of the world's population 
lives in urban areas and the development suggests 
Edlund/Problemy Ekorozwoju/Problems of Sustainable Development 1/2020, 15-23  
 
16 
that by 2030 it will increase to about 70 percent (Ni-
kodinoska et al., 2018). 
This development has led to ecosystems and natural 
resources being depleted and creating an imbalance 
in the environment, as large volumes of resources are 
transported and accumulated in one area and give 
rise to large amounts of waste and pollution. This 
causes the area to be heavily burdened by pollution 
that causes economic resources and the health of the 
population to be affected. 
The UN's Agenda 2030 has 17 goals to work with for 
a more sustainable development for our planet. Ob-
jective 15, with the aim of: ... protecting, restoring 
and promoting the sustainable use of land-based 
ecosystems, sustainable use of forests, combating 
desertification, stopping and reversing land degra-
dation and halting the loss of biodiversity (Regering-
skansliet, 2015). 
As the population grows globally and trends indicate 
that we are increasingly moving towards urbaniza-
tion, pressures on the environment will increase, and 
must be met by systems that can counteract these 
pressures (Vallecillo et al., 2018; Wilkerson et al., 
2018). 
Ecosystem services is a concept that aims at the 
products and services that nature's ecosystem pro-
vides to man and that contributes to our well-being 
and quality of life. Like for example: pollination, 
natural water regulation and nature experiences 
(Naturvårdsverket, 2019). 
These services can be integrated into our societies in 
order to achieve an increased balance in the environ-
ment, but also an increased well-being for the popu-
lation. The integration can form the basis for sup-
porting biodiversity and ecosystem services, im-
proving air quality, regulating microclimate, beauti-
fication of urban landscape, preventing and mitigat-
ing traffic and providing leisure entertainment for 
the population (Naturvårdsverket, 2015; Wang Y. et 
al., 2018). 
In the earlier stages of the industrialization, the 
Western world has not taken much account of the en-
vironment since there was confidence in the dilution 
of the environment. This means that environmental 
aspects in decision-making processes rarely received 
priority, but economic and social aspects were those 
that were driving decision-making. Over time, we 
have increased our population and our production 
and consumption habits, which means that many 
ecosystems are now being completely eliminated or 
are on the verge of collapse. This contributes to that 
our financial resources and human health is suffering 
from environmental problems (Demuzere et al., 
2014; Elmqvist et al., 2015). 
For developing countries, eg China and India, which 
are now expanding their urban environments to ac-
commodate a larger population and industries, have 
shown that the health of the population has deterio-
rated. This development is similar to the one that oc-
curred during the Western world industrialization 
but is much more extensive as these countries not 
only produce for themselves but the whole world 
(Xiao et al., 2017; Zinia & McShane, 2018).  
In a society that is moving towards urbanization 
where the majority of the population is gathered on 
a smaller area, the region is subjected to a consider-
able amount of different types of waste that arise as 
a result of our lifestyle. The waste produced erodes 
the surrounding environment which affects our econ-
omy and can directly or indirectly harm people's 
health psychologically and physically. Therefore, it 
is important for urban planning to integrate the envi-
ronmental aspect and the ecosystem services that 
help the people and the environment in order to live 
a safe and healthy life and not at the expense of the 
environment (Wilkerson et al., 2018). 
The aim of the literature study is to look at how ur-
ban ecosystem services can be beneficial in a society 
both socially and economically and methods for val-
uing these services. 
 
2. Method 
 
Karlstad University Library's search engine One-
Search was used to find relevant literature for this 
study. 
First, an overall search for ecosystem services was 
made to increase understanding of the subject. The 
increased understanding resulted in several search 
phrases that could be used to make the search more 
focused. The phrases used in the searches are in Eng-
lish to get literature from as large a range as possible. 
For all searches, articles were chosen from 2017 on-
wards in order to get as up-to-date information as 
possible. Only peer-reviewed academic journals 
were included, Newspapers, e-books, trade maga-
zines and reviews were excluded from the study. 
The Advanced Search function was included which 
allows three phrases in a search. There, the first two 
were always Urban ecosystem services and Urban 
green infrastructure, the third was varied to angle 
the search to relevant areas. From the searches the 
first 100 articles were reviewed by reading the title 
to see if it was relevant and then the summary to add 
the literature. Search the phrases and the number of 
hits are shown in the table 1. 
 
Table 1. Number of hits each search gave. The top row was 
used for the overall search within the area.

3. Literature review: Ecosystem Services 
 
Urban ecosystem services 
Urban ecosystem services are aimed at a variety of 
environments that are implemented in a society and 
can be categorized as green or blue. Green refers to: 
parks, city forests, cemeteries, vacancies, gardens 
and landfills and the blue: streams, lakes, ponds, ar-
tificial ramparts and storm water holding ponds. This 
means that there is a high demand for ecosystem ser-
vices in urban environments where there are a large 
number of users who can take advantage of it 
(Elmqvist et al., 2015; Roebeling et al., 2017; Felty-
nowski et al., 2018). 
The challenges with urban ecosystem services are 
that they address land surface in areas that are con-
sidered to have strong commercial value and can 
therefore be a problem in decision-making about 
how the land should be used for society. These areas 
can therefore easily fall for opportunism, which 
means that the area is instead becomes a contributing 
source for emissions and pollution of the environ-
ment. Another challenge is that they have to be main-
tained in the aspects of cleaning, security or any 
other form of administration, otherwise they lose 
their function and value. The financing of the 
maintenance usually comes from state resources 
such as taxes, management funds or ticket revenues 
(Jiang, 2017; Chiara, 2018; Wang Y. et al., 2018). 
Studies also show that knowledge of urban ecosys-
tem services for both state, organizations and indi-
viduals raises the value and function of the service. 
For state and organizations it’s about how and where 
to implement it in order to achieve the best function 
and therefore get a financial understanding of the 
service more easily. For individuals it is to know 
how it affects the human body to stay in green areas 
and in that way appreciate the value of it. The 
knowledge also leads to such implementations being 
better cared for and appreciated by the whole society 
(Elmqvist et al., 2015; Wang Y. et al., 2018; Wilker-
son et al., 2018). 
 
Green infrastructure 
Green infrastructure aims to including in urban plan-
ning varying types of ecosystem services to fulfil dif-
ferent functions in society. Using green infrastruc-
ture in urban planning includes protecting, preserv-
ing, restoring and recreating habitats, ecosystem 
functions, and natural processes. This is to manage 
the natural resources that exist locally and region-
ally. This helps to secure a functional and sustainable 
society (Derkzen et al., 2017; Wang J. & Banzhaf, 
2018; Wang Y.-C. et al., 2018). 
Implementing green infrastructure has been applied 
to many projects, but some have not fulfilled any ma-
jor function or social benefit more than visually. This 
is often the case if shortcuts are made as financial 
reasons for the cost of plant and maintenance. Using 
green infrastructure only for visual functions in ur-
ban planning is commonplace but undermines its 
purpose of fulfilling many functions that are of ben-
efit to society (Demuzere et al., 2014; Huang et al., 
2018; Mabon & Shih, 2018; Marino & Lapintie, 
2018). 
 
Social effects 
People have many needs that they feel that a society 
must be able to satisfy. Everything from basic needs 
like clean air, fresh water, financial security and 
safety from disasters. As economic security in-
creases, trends show that the need for self-actualiza-

18 
tion becomes increasingly important for the individ-
ual. This is important for how different ecosystem 
services can be prioritized in a society and can be 
used to promote well-being and fulfil the needs that 
they have (Chen et al., 2018; Wilkerson et al., 2018). 
We can adapt ecosystem services to our needs in the 
communities, but they usually give rise to several ef-
fects that are beneficial to our well-being. Studies 
show that there is a connection between elements of 
nature, such as parks, reduce stress and strengthen 
mental health (Hegetschweiler et al., 2017; Amano 
et al., 2018; Chiabai et al., 2018). 
But there are also studies that show that parks can be 
a stress factor. In some areas of Asia and Africa, 
there are debates about the valuation of city parks as 
they are associated with crime such as violence, sex-
ual abuse and theft. This is because the vegetation in 
the parks makes it difficult to have a functioning 
safety for the visitors (Shackleton et al., 2017; Kim 
& Jin, 2018; Mexia et al., 2018; Wilkerson et al., 
2018). 
As mentioned earlier, the design of ecosystem ser-
vices is linked to the economic security of society. 
This means that it is a class issue where richer areas 
have more natural elements than the poorer ones. 
Studies show that the use of green areas is much 
higher for the upper and middle classes in societies 
when priorities changes with an increased financial 
security (Elmqvist et al., 2015; Riechers et al., 2018; 
Wilkerson et al., 2018). 
 
Economic effects 
The prioritization of urban ecosystem services varies 
widely between countries. Developing countries 
usually prioritize economic growth, above all else, 
unlike western countries where the environment is 
an increasingly growing issue, but all countries have 
environmental problems to a greater or lesser extent. 
These problems are an increasingly growing finan-
cial expense for countries where investment in new 
technology and clean-up is needed to restore nature. 
These expenses are ultimately linked to human 
health and well-being, which in turn affects our so-
ciety (Gustafsson et al., 2018; Wang Y. et al., 2018). 
Implementing urban ecosystem services is usually 
faced with economic growth as they use commercial 
land areas that can generate jobs for society. In addi-
tion, they require financial maintenance for manage-
ment and do not give rise to any direct income, so it 
is difficult to argue the economic benefits (Elmqvist 
et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Bissonnette et al., 2018). 
But they give rise to indirect savings in society as the 
previous example of city parks where they reduce 
stress can provide an indirect saving for reduced sick 
leave and a reduced burden on health care. For coun-
tries with warmer climates, parks can give rise to mi-
croclimate that lowers the temperature with their 
vegetation and thus reduce energy  consumption  for  
 
climate systems (Nielsen-Pincus et al.. 2017; Val-
lecillo et al.. 2019). 
 
4. Valuation methods 
 
PES – Paying-for-Ecosystem Services 
Paying for ecosystem services (PES) is a method for 
providing incentives for environmental management 
that is used primarily by governments and compa-
nies. The method aims to provide an additional cost 
to be used by the managers to maintain one or more 
ecosystem services that provides those who are con-
sidered as users or those who benefit from the ser-
vice. The PES method can be developed around spe-
cific ecosystem services such as drinking water qual-
ity or around the more general environmental values 
such as the preservation of e.g. biodiversity 
(Rodríguez-Loinaz et al., 2018; Sirakaya et al., 2018; 
Wang Y. et al., 2018). 
However, the PES method has been criticized for be-
ing often used solely by economic values and should 
instead focus on moral values that are based in the 
environment (Lima et al., 2017; Nielsen-Pincus et 
al., 2017). 
 
WTP / WTA – Willingness-To-Pay / Accept 
This method is a process for creating a basis for ac-
ceptance or financial evaluation for a change or im-
plementation of a service. The basis is often from 
surveys where people or companies are asked what 
they are willing to pay or accept for a service or prod-
uct. This method is common in the case of goods or 
services that do not have value on the market. 
When it comes to goods and services that do not have 
a market value, demand is more significant, and 
when it comes to environmental goods it is usually a 
geographical issue of access (Adegun, 2017; Niel-
sen-Pincus et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2017; Aguilar et 
al., 2018; Ariful Islam et al., 2018). 
 
Replacement cost 
The replacement cost method is used to allocate an 
economic value to an ecosystem service based on the 
cost of replacing such natural resource with a tech-
nical solution. The method can be applied if certain 
conditions are met: 1) the technology can provide the 
same nature service / s that are generated, 2) the cho-
sen technology is the cheapest option for the exam-
ined nature service, and 3) there is a general demand 
for the chosen technology when the nature service is 
no longer available. One of the disadvantages of the 
replacement cost method is that technicians as alter-
natives to nature services only provide one or a lim-
ited set of services compared to the multifunctional 
ecosystems. In addition, it is difficult to find a per-
fect technological replacement for an ecosystem ser-
vice (Meerow & Newell, 2017; Silvennoinen et al., 
2017; Groshans et al., 2018; Nikodinoska et al., 
2018).

5. Discussion 
 
There are several interesting reflections that can be 
made from the literature review presented here in re-
lation to the three aspects of the environment, econ-
omy and social. There were few articles that chose to 
look at the problems from all three aspects from a 
sustainability perspective. 
From the literature it has been a problem to weigh 
the pros and cons against each other for these three 
aspects. So therefore it will be discussed about urban 
ecosystem services from these three aspects. 
 
Environmental aspect 
How we plan our societies is one of the keys to sus-
tainable development. Implementing ecosystem ser-
vices in urban planning, so-called green infrastruc-
ture, has many benefits that can help our well-being 
and strengthen our finances. 
Therefore it is important to have knowledge of the 
multifunctional properties of ecosystem services. 
According to (Wang J. & Banzhaf, 2018), it is im-
portant to know what features the services provide 
and how they work, both to adapt them to new urban 
environmental challenges and to mitigate urban en-
vironment problems, increase resilience and main-
tain quality of life. Multifunctionality should be re-
garded as a step in the decision-making process, 
where we make choices between functions in order 
to best adapt them to the needs of society in order to 
put them in correlation with economic gain. 
Having a well-functioning green infrastructure can 
include the properties they give rise to, for example. 
biodiversity conservation and cooling effects from 
green roofs, recreational accessibility, heat control of 
urban gardens. Knowledge helps increase social 
recognition of how people benefit from our ecosys-
tems that are part of the green infrastructure. If eco-
system services become part of our urban planning 
and prove the link between the environment and so-
cial processes, it can maintain or even improve peo-
ple's well-being and thus promote sustainable urban 
development. 
 
Social aspect 
Implementing ecosystem services in society does not 
have the same importance or priority for different 
countries in the world. The issue of prioritization is 
often defined by which government prevails in the 
country and the economic situation. For developing 
countries, economic growth is often prioritized and 
then the environmental aspect and the social aspect 
are often ignored if there is great poverty in the coun-
try. But regardless ecosystem services are in some 
way a part of society, which often depends on the 
needs of the population. 
In South Africa, there are large social gaps and is an 
example of what ecosystem services have for the dif-
ferent classes. (Wilkerson et al., 2018) study shows 
that the upper and middle classes tend to often use 
their plots for vegetation that increase the visual 
beauty to satisfy their needs. If you look at the sub-
class then the plots are usually used for fruit trees or 
other vegetation that yields a return to safeguard the 
need for food as they often have an economic uncer-
tainty. 
So the question of how ecosystem services are to be 
used in a society depends on the needs that the pop-
ulation wants to fulfil. It is therefore important to see 
in the urban planning what needs exist and thus adapt 
Edlund/Problemy Ekorozwoju/Problems of Sustainable Development 1/2020, 15-23  
 
20 
the ecosystem services for this but also to ensure a 
safe living environment. Looking at the development 
in China and India where large expansions of hous-
ing and companies occur and where one often ig-
nores the construction of green areas even though it 
has been found that there is a large demand from the 
population according to (Wei et al., 2018; Zinia & 
McShane, 2018). Many use green areas to unwind 
and feel a little closer to nature but also that trees 
have great advantages in large cities and especially 
in warmer countries where they help to ventilate and 
cool the air. Many studies indicate that we have a 
strong connection to nature and that they help to 
strengthen the well-being of the population. 
So social factors can have a profound influence on 
the demand and supply of urban ecosystem services, 
and bring many benefits to the city's inhabitants from 
green spaces. Therefore, urban planning that in-
cludes these features can design and provide green 
spaces that can potentially improve health and well-
being. (Wilkerson et al., 2018) believes that moving 
towards a sustainable society, urban planning must 
include the needs that the population demands and 
inform about its properties so that they are accepted 
and become part of society. 
 
Economic aspect 
Arguing for ecosystem services from an economic 
perspective is difficult as they often lack a commer-
cial value on the market. Therefore, they must be 
valued to obtain a basis so that decisions that are 
made have an integrated economic value where the 
environment receives the same priority as the eco-
nomic and social. Many cities have chosen to re-
move the ecosystems that exist in the immediate vi-
cinity to make room for companies and industries to 
stimulate economic growth, which in some cases has 
led to great economic consequences. 
Houston, Texas is an example of what happens if one 
ignores the importance of ecosystem services and 
it’s functions. Houston is a well-developed industrial 
city that is located near a desert, which means that 
they have more extreme weather conditions. The 
whole city area has largely been covered with con-
crete and asphalt and has very few green areas. These 
conditions mean that in the event of more severe 
rainfall, which often occurs around the deserts, it 
causes great flooding in the city since the water must 
be led out of the city instead of running through it. 
Had the city e.g. used parks and forest areas inte-
grated into the city, the water could go down through 
the city as trees help prevent erosion and that it helps 
to create groundwater that is in short supply in Hou-
ston, which has also been contaminated by the 
floods. Not having taken ecosystem services into ac-
count has cost the city large sums of money and 
many people's lives. Florida, too, has problems with 
floods that are of the rising sea levels but are linked 
to climate change. This has meant that they have to 
invest in large drainage and pumping systems to 
avoid the greatest devastation caused by floods ac-
cording to (Berland et al., 2017; BenDor et al., 2018; 
Czajkowski et al., 2018). 
The importance of ecosystem services is not only the 
direct effect but also the long-term, which helps to 
balance the various fluctuations of human emissions. 
Calculating the economic value of ecosystem ser-
vices provides useful arguments for environmental 
improvements but is often insufficient to fully cap-
ture the scope of the benefits of restoring ecosystem 
services in cities. This is because the value is more 
dependent on time and its ability to balance environ-
mental changes. But this can be perceived as inflated 
values to promote ecosystem services, which means 
that the basis for the valuation must be able to argue 
for itself (Elmqvist et al., 2015). 
Investing in restoring, protecting and improving 
green infrastructure and ecosystem services in cities 
is not only good for the environment but also socially 
desirable. They are often economically feasible, for 
many western countries, provided that the multifunc-
tional characteristics and all other benefits to the lo-
cal population are counted. Such information is nec-
essary to include in decision-making processes and 
use as a basis for setting an economic value for land 
use and management in society. It can help and guide 
city planners in the decision-making process as well 
as private and other stakeholders.  
 
Implementation methods 
The difficulty with ecosystem services is that these 
are usually a general resource that has no commer-
cial value on the market. In addition, the valuation 
has a strong link to the size of the resource available 
in a given region. 
In Sweden, there is a very large supply of fresh water 
and therefore has a lower value in the eyes of the 
population as opposed to a country such as Australia 
who has a shortage of it and must invest in expensive 
technology in order to meet the population's needs. 
Therefore, it is very difficult to be able to set fixed 
values for ecosystem services and its returns (Varis 
et al., 2017). 
Paying-for-Ecosystem-Services or PES is a concept 
of the willingness to pay to build ecosystem services 
that contribute to improving the environment or 
other products that nature provides. PES has been 
applied in New York and Munich where it cleans the 
river basin, which is a source of fresh water for the 
population using ecosystem services (Aguilar et al., 
2018; BenDor et al., 2018). The method is used as a 
premium on the bill or tax on drinking water that is 
earmarked to go to the improvement of the water 
quality. The method can be compared with WTP but 
differs as it must be valued on the basis of the popu-
lation who are connected to the service and what 
they are willing to pay or accept to have it delivered. 
WTP is an interesting method as it helps to create an 
idea of how ecosystem services are valued by the 
population. But it requires that there is enough infor- 
Edlund/Problemy Ekorozwoju/Problems of Sustainable Development 1/2020, 15-23  
 
21 
mation available to be able to get the desired effect 
and that it focuses on different target groups. The 
richer part of the population usually uses resources 
in larger quantities and can pay for minor changes, 
unlike the middle and subclasses that are more sen-
sitive to change. 
The compensation method is more focused on com-
panies and industries, as they often use natural areas 
to establish themselves. The method should be done 
in conjunction with an EIA (environmental impact 
assessment) as it can be very difficult to estimate the 
layout of the local area and how it is affected by the 
change. It’s based on roughly the same principle as 
PPP (Polluter-Pays-Principle) where you pay for the 
changes you give rise to. But it gives rise to many 
issues such as cumulative effects, assets in the im-
mediate area and valuations of services etc. In order 
for it to work better, I believe that one must look at 
the entire ecosystem and value it, then see percent-
age to how much land that is seized and then earmark 
the value when an implementation must take place to 
preserve the ecosystems. 
 
Conclusion 
 
From the literature study it feels that the recurring 
problem is how we look at urban ecosystem services 
and how little understanding we have of its functions 
in society. The reason was perceived as a lack of 
knowledge that makes it possible to put them in cor-
relation with economic and social aspects. From the 
literature it feels that there is no basis for looking at 
ecosystem services from all three aspects mentioned 
above: Economics, social and environment. 
To fill the gaps from the literature study, further 
studies should be carried out in these areas: 
• 
How to increase knowledge about the mul-
tifunctional properties of ecosystem ser-
vices and how they contribute to our soci-
ety. 
• 
Examine the connection between people's 
well-being and nature. 
• 
Analysing ecosystem services within the 
three-base-line for sustainable develop-
ment: Environment, social, economy 
• 
Create a basis for how ecosystems should 
be valued in order to increase its prioritiza-
tion in society.

Mortality and incidence of cancer among Swedish
gas workers
P Gustavsson, Christina Reuterwall
Abstract
The mortality and incidence of cancer was
studied among 295 workers at a Swedish gas
production company. All men employed for at
least one year between 1965 and 1972 were
included in the study. The follow up period for
mortality was 1966 to 1986, and the incidence of
cancer was followed up from 1966 to 1983.
Expected numbers of deaths were based on
local death rates among occupationally active
men, the expected numbers of cancer were
based on national statistics. The total mor-
tality was increased, mainly due to an excess of
deaths from circulatory diseases. The excess
was larger after long follow up and after long
employment periods. Two cases of cancer in
the nose and nasal sinuses were found; there
was no excess of lung cancer. Smoking habits
were investigated for a subset ofthe cohort and
did not differ from the average for men in
large cities. The findings are discussed in rela-
tion to other studies of soot and combustion
exposed workers.
Coal gas is produced by dry distillation of bitumin-
ous coal. Coke, the residue after distillation,
is
formed as a byproduct.
The Stockholm Gas Company has produced gas
since the middle of the nineteenth century. The
current plant started in 1893 and coal gas was
produced in coke ovens from around 1918 to 1972.
Before 1918 the gas was produced in retorts and since
1972 gas has been produced by cracking ofpetroleum
products. The coke ovens were similar to those in a
coke plant and coke was an important byproduct.
Around 150 000 000 m' gas and 300 000 metric tons
coke were produced annually in the period 1950-70.
Gas and coke workers are exposed to gas and

smoke from the ovens. The first study indicating an
increased risk of cancer for gas workers was publi-
shed in 1936, when Kuroda and Kawahata reported
an excess of lung cancer at a Japanese gas plant.'
Excesses of cancer of the lung and bladder were later
reported among 2449 British gas workers2 and an
excess of lung cancer was also found in a small cohort
of Danish gas workers.3 Several case reports indicate
that gas workers are also at increased risk for skin
cancer. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
have been pointed out as the most probable cause of
the excess risks.4
The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) evaluated the cancer hazards for gas produc-
tion workers and concluded that there was sufficient
evidence that coal tar from destructive distillation of
coal in gas works causes skin cancer in man and there
was also sufficient evidence that certain exposures in
retort houses of older coal gasification processes are
carcinogenic and give rise to lung cancer in man.4
There was limited evidence that such occupational
exposures also cause bladder cancer. No data were
available for exposures in newer processes.
The occupational exposures associated with coal
gas production have several similarities with those in
coke plants, where coke is produced for metallurgical
purposes and gas is a byproduct. An excess of lung
cancer was reported among 4661 workers in 12 coke
plants in the United States and Canada. There was
also a tendency towards increased mortality in cancer
of the kidney and prostate.'9
An excess of lung cancer was found among 6767
English coke production workers (SMR = 117)9 and
among
1269
French
coke
production
workers
(SMR= 251).1o
An investigation of the mortality and incidence of
cancer at a Swedish coke plant was first published in
1979""1 and the study was updated in 1987.12 There
was an increased mortality from ischaemic heart
disease but no definite indications ofan excess oflung
cancer in this small cohort.
Thus there is strong evidence for an increased risk
of lung cancer among coke and gas workers, possibly
caused by exposure to PAH. In recent years an
increased risk for atherosclerotic disease has also
been reported among workers exposed to combus-
tion products and PAH. Excesses of ischaemic heart
disease

sweeps,13 '4 Danish chimney sweeps,""5 tar distillation

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the
risk of cancer in a comparatively modern gas com-
pany and to investigate further the relation between
exposure to PAH and atherosclerosis in man.
EXPOSURE CONDITIONS AND WORK TASKS
The exposure to benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was measured
in the current plant by area sampling on top of the
ovens. In 1964 a mean level of 4 3 ,ug/m3 of BaP was
detected, (range 0 007-33 ,ug/m3).
In 1965 lower
levels were found, mean 0 52 pg/m3, range 0 021-
1-29 pg/m3.'8 Calculations indicate that Swedish coke
plants (including the current gas company) have had
exposures of the same magnitude as in American
plants.'8
Generator gas for heating the coke ovens was
produced in the steam and generator department.
Generator gas contains -around 3000 carbon mono-
xide.
In 1967 the carbon monoxide content in exhaled
air was measured among the workers at the coke
ovens and at the steam and generator central as a
surrogate for carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) levels in
blood. A mean level of 20o COHb was found in 135
samples from 29 non-smoking workers at the gen-
erator
central. Twelve
per
cent of the samples
showed levels over 500 COHb, indicating a definite
occupational exposure to carbon monoxide. In 561
samples from 63 non-smokers in the coke oven
department the mean level was 04%Vk. Only 0 4%V
of
these
samples
showed
values
over 5% COHb,
indicating that only a few of these workers were
exposed to carbon monoxide in significant amounts
(unpublished data).
In the coke department coke was sorted, transpor-
ted, and stored. The work was dusty but no hygienic
measurements are available. The byproduct workers
handled benzene; exposure levels are unknown. The
workshop and maintenance workers have had inter-
mittent exposures, since many of them have moved
all over the plant. The outside workers transported
coal from the harbour to the coke ovens and the
workers at the department for sample preparation
collected samples of coal and coke for quality control.
All workers in the gas company were exposed to dust
coated with PAHs in varying degrees.
Study population and methods
All men employed for at least one year between
1 January 1965 and 30 June 1972 were identified
from company records. Data on work tasks and
employment periods were recorded for all 300 iden-
tified individuals. Data on work tasks before 1965
were not available, however, and in calculating
employment periods all workers were assumed to
have worked in the same department before 1965 as
they did at the beginning of that year. Exposure
period was calculated as the period from actual start
of employment until separation from employment
or until 30 June 1972 when the coal gasification
stopped.
Interviews were performed with a group of older
workers and foremen in the workshop and mainten-
ance departments regarding the smoking habits of
the cohort members in these departments. Smoking
data for 950o
of the cohort members
in these
departments were obtained in this way.
Outcome was traced by a computerised register of
the living population at Stockholm County Adminis-
tration Board, death and burial books at the clerical
parishes, and Stockholm City Archives. Underlying
causes of deaths were obtained from
Statistics
Sweden and data on the incidence of cancer were
obtained from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Mor-
tality was investigated from 1966 to 1986 and the
incidence of cancer from 1966 to 1983.
Four of the 300 cohort members had emigrated
and one was never registered in Swedish population
registers.
These
five
individuals were excluded
from the analyses. Table
1 shows the number of
individuals and average employment periods in each
department.
Expected numbers of deaths and cancers were
computed according to the person-year method,
counting years at risk for each individual, specific for
five year age class and five year calendar time class.
The OCMAP'9 and EPILIN2"" computer programs
were used for the calculations.
The reference rates for mortality were based on the
mortality in ""Greater Stockholm,"" a geographical
area including Stockholm City and the surrounding
communities. A second set of reference rates was
also
calculated,
based on
the
mortality among
occupationally active men. The rates were derived by
combining the local mortality data with information
on the mortality among employed and not employed
individuals obtained in the national census of 1960.21
This second set of rates reflects the local mortality

Discussion
There was an increased mortality from circulatory
diseases and violent deaths among the gas workers.
The possible causes, the effects of smoking habits,
and choice of reference population are discussed
below.
CIRCULATORY DISEASES
The mortality from circulatory diseases, including
ischaemic heart disease, was increased in the cohort
and the increase was more pronounced after long
follow up and after a long employment period. This
supports that the excess was caused by occupational
factors.
An increased risk of ischaemic heart disease has
been reported
also
in other
groups exposed
to
combustion products, and animal experimental data
suggest that PAH may be the causative factor.2324 In
addition,
it has been proposed that the athero-
sclerotic plaque is a benign smooth muscle neoplastic
tumour."" A recent study showed the presence of a
transforming gene in human atherosclerotic plaque
DNA, indicating that somatic cell-gene alterations
play a part in atherosclerotic plaque development.26
The largest excess of ischaemic heart disease was
found among the workshop and maintenance work-
ers and not among the coke oven workers. The coke
oven workers had considerably shorter employment
periods, however, and their cumulated exposure to
PAHs may have been lower than that for the work-
shop and maintenance workers. No definite con-
clusions may be formulated since exposure data are
lacking.
The study was limited to workers employed for
at least one year between 1965 and 1972. In 1965
the plant had already been operating for a long time
and many of the gas workers had started their
employment earlier. This leads to a lack of indi-
viduals with short employment periods in the cohort
and since the long term employed workers are a
""surviving"" population the risks may be under-
estimated.27
An excess ofischaemic heart disease was also found
among coke oven workers at a Swedish steel plant,12
although no excess has been reported among coke
oven workers or gas workers in the United States' or
United Kingdom.29 Lack of smoking data and possi-
ble bias from the healthy worker effect make direct
comparisons difficult, however.2829
OTHER CAUSES OF DEATH
There were indications of an excess of respiratory
diseases after long follow up, with three observed
cases whereas 07 would be expected. The high
exposure to dust may have played a part, although no
conclusions can be based on only three cases.
CANCER INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY
There were two cases of nasal and sinonasal cancer
whereas only 007 would be expected. An association
with exposure to chemicals in the workplace could be
explained by deposition in the nasal mucosa of dust
particles
of large
diameters
coated
with PAH.

Increased risks for nose and sinonasal cancer have
been found among wood (furniture) workers,3032 but
not among gas or coke oven workers.
Neither the incidence nor the mortality of lung
cancer was increased. This agrees with the findings
in the Swedish cohort of coke oven workers'2 but
deviates from the excess found among coke oven
workers in the United States.
The reason for the normal rate of lung cancer is
obscure. The explanation for the non-positive find-
ings may be the high turnover rate ofthe workforce at
the coke ovens, leading
to
a comparatively low
cumulated dose of PAHs. The number of expected
cases was small and chance may also have contributed
to the normal finding.
SMOKING HABITS
Fifty two per cent of the workshop and maintenance
workers were daily smokers. The smoking habits in a
sample ofthe Swedish population comprising 55 000
subjects were investigated in 1963."" In large cities in
ages 18-49 57% were daily smokers and in ages 50-69
56% were smokers. Although a different method was
used for collecting data in our study, it seems as ifthe
workshop and maintenance workers had smoking
habits similar to those in the reference population
and the excess ofcirculatory diseases does not seem to
be caused by tobacco smoking.
REFERENCE RATES FOR MORTALITY
The SMRs based on occupationally active men as
referents were derived to reduce the bias from the
healthy worker effect.2' The error introduced by the
approximations seem to be small and the magnitude
of the healthy worker effect was similar to what has
been found in other studies.' These rates have been
given preference in the evaluation.

ABSTRACT
Objectives Previous studies of chimney sweeps have
shown an excess mortality from cardiovascular diseases,
although the extent of confounding from tobacco
smoking is uncertain. The present study used referents of
similar socioeconomic background as the chimney
sweeps in order to reduce confounding, included both
lethal and surviving cases of myocardial infarction, and
investigated dose–response in terms of duration of
employment.
Methods A cohort of 4436 male chimney sweeps was
identiﬁed from nationwide trade union records from
1918 to 2006. Myocardial infarctions during 1991–
2005 were identiﬁed from the Swedish nationwide
register of ﬁrst-time myocardial infarctions. Standardised
incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated using skilled
manual workers in the service sector in Sweden to
calculate expected numbers.
Results There was a strong and statistically signiﬁcant
excess of myocardial infarction among the chimney
sweeps, SIR 1.39 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.55). The excess
was observed among both short- and long-term
employed.
Conclusions While the excess of myocardial infarction
among the short-term employed may be due to tobacco
and, possibly, alcohol use, it is likely that the excess
noted among the long-term employed was caused by
the high exposure to combustion products, particles or
metals still occurring among chimney sweeps. Preventive
measures to reduce hazardous occupational exposures as
well as smoking and alcohol use among chimney sweeps
are urgently needed.
INTRODUCTION
The Swedish chimney sweeps cohort study com-
prises over 6000 trade union organised chimney
sweeps employed during 1918–2006. A recent
update of the mortality in this cohort showed sig-
niﬁcantly increased standardised mortality ratios
(SMRs) for diseases of the circulatory and respira-
tory system, as well as alcohol-related causes of
deaths.1 Moreover, the incidence of several cancers
was increased, including cancer of the lung, pleura,
liver, bladder, oesophagus, colon and haemato-
lymphatic organs.2
The ﬁnding in our recent update1 of a marked
excess of deaths from ischaemic heart disease (SMR
1.20, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.32) may be due to occupa-
tional chemical exposures in view of the well-
known association between exposure to particulate
matter in urban air and cardiovascular disease.3
However, a national health examination survey of
Swedish
chimney
sweeps
performed
in
1972
showed excess smoking and alcohol habits com-
pared with the general population.4 Thus, it is
uncertain to what extent the excess of myocardial
infarction could be attributed to occupational expo-
sures like dust, combustion products or metals or
to lifestyle exposures such as tobacco smoking or
alcohol consumption associated with low socio-
economic status.
The aim of the present study was to further investi-
gate the excess mortality from ischaemic heart disease
by focusing on both lethal and non-lethal myocardial
infarctions, that is, incident acute myocardial infarc-
tions, to investigate dose–response associations by
studying duration of employment, and to use a com-
parison group of similar socioeconomic status as the
chimney sweeps in order to reduce potential con-
founding from lifestyle exposures.
METHODS
The design of this cohort study has been described
in detail elsewhere.1 2 In brief, the cohort com-
prises more than 6000 male Swedish chimney
sweeps who were members of the Swedish chimney
sweeps’ trade union between 1918 and 2006. Data
on deaths and emigrations were obtained from
nationwide
Swedish
registers
of
the
Total
Population and Causes of Deaths, linked to the
cohort by the personal identity numbers (a unique
number assigned to all Swedish residents). Data on
What this paper adds
▸Previous studies of chimney sweeps have
shown an excess mortality from cardiovascular
diseases, although the extent of confounding
from tobacco smoking is uncertain.
▸The present study used a reference population
of similar socioeconomic status in order to
reduce potential confounding by adverse
lifestyle factors and improved statistical power
by inclusion of both lethal and surviving cases
of myocardial infarction.
▸This large prospective cohort study of chimney
sweeps showed a strongly increased risk of
myocardial infarction among both short- and
long-term-employed chimney sweeps.
▸Preventive measures to reduce hazardous
occupational exposures as well as smoking and
alcohol use among chimney sweeps are
urgently needed.

Occup Environ Med: first published as 10.1136/oemed-2013-101371 on 17 April 2013. Downloaded from 
incident acute myocardial infarctions were obtained by matching
to the nationwide register of ﬁrst-time, that is, incident myocar-
dial infarctions held by the Swedish National Board of Health
and Welfare. This register includes information on both lethal
and non-lethal ﬁrst-time myocardial infarctions since 1987 and
is based on inpatient diagnoses and causes of deaths classiﬁed
according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases.
The cohort members were followed from the date of their
ﬁrst membership/employment period or 1 January 1991, which-
ever came last, up to 31 December 2005, ﬁrst myocardial infarc-
tion, death or emigration, whichever came ﬁrst.
Expected numbers of infarctions were derived from a refer-
ence data set including all Swedish residents participating in the
Swedish census of 1980, holding information on incidence of
myocardial infarctions during 1991–2005 for each of 18 socio-
economic groups in total.5 For this reference population, myo-
cardial infarctions were identiﬁed from the same nationwide
register as for the chimney sweeps. The expected numbers of
myocardial infarctions were based on incidence rates among all
those classiﬁed as skilled manual workers in the service sector
(ie, code 22 in the Swedish socioeconomic classiﬁcation scheme)
in the 1980 census. Persons who were too young or too old to
be economically active in 1980 could not be classiﬁed regarding
socioeconomic status and the present analyses were restricted to
men in the ages 40–79 during follow-up during 1991–2005.
Person-years were stratiﬁed by 5-year age groups (40–44, 45–
49, …, 75–79 years) and 5-year calendar periods (1991–1995,
1996–2000, 2001–2005). Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs)
were estimated by the person-year method. Exact 95% CIs for
the SIRs were estimated assuming that the observed events fol-
lowed a Poisson distribution.
We performed analyses stratiﬁed by employment duration as a
proxy for cumulative exposure and by latency (time since ﬁrst
employment). All analyses were performed with SAS, release
V.9.2. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review
Board in Stockholm (Dnr 2007-306-31).
RESULTS
Our prior analyses of mortality included 6374 chimney sweeps.
In the present study, we excluded 1033 persons who had died
before the start of follow-up in 1991, 24 persons who had emi-
grated before the start of follow-up, 46 persons who had had
myocardial infarction before the start of follow-up and 832
persons who were either too young or too old to contribute any
person-years during follow-up. Thus, the present cohort com-
prised 4436 male chimney sweeps, contributing in total 49 268
person-years.
We observed an almost 1.4-fold increased risk of myocardial
infarction (SIR 1.39, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.55) among chimney
sweeps compared with the male Swedish population of similar
socioeconomic status (table 1). The point estimates were above
unity within all duration groups and were signiﬁcantly increased
both for those employed less than 10 years and for those
employed more than 30 years. However, SIRs did not increase
with duration of employment; rather, there was a tendency to a
U-shaped dose–response curve (table 1).
An analysis of SIRs by time since ﬁrst employment (ie,
latency) showed that only six myocardial infarctions had
occurred within 20 years since ﬁrst employment. Most chimney
sweeps start their employment at a young age when the baseline
rate of myocardial infarction is very low. The point estimates
were signiﬁcantly increased both for the group with latency
20–29 years (SIR 1.54; 95% CI 1.03 to 2.23) and 30+ years
(SIR 1.36; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.53).
DISCUSSION
In this large prospective cohort study we observed a signiﬁcantly
increased risk of myocardial infarction among Swedish chimney
sweeps compared with skilled manual workers in the service
sector. The risk did not increase with duration of employment.
The risk among those employed >30 years was almost as high
as among those employed >0–9 years, while there was a ten-
dency to lower risks in the intermediate duration categories.
If there were no harmful effect from the occupational exposure,
lower risk estimates would be expected with increasing employ-
ment duration due to the so-called healthy worker survivor effect
(HWSE).6 The HWSE effect is partly caused by an over-
representation of individuals with a less healthy lifestyle among
short-term employed workers. In a prior study, Swedish chimney
sweeps showed excess smoking and alcohol habits as compared
with the general male Swedish population.4 This is a potential
explanation for the excess risk observed among the short-term
employed, although the use of a comparison group of similar socio-
economic status would reduce potential confounding from life-
style associated factors. Another mechanism contributing to the
HWSE is that individuals who suffer from negative health effects
from an occupational exposure tend to change job, thus causing an
over-representation of healthy persons among those still in the
occupation after long employment.
As no reduction in risk with longer employment was observed,
occupational exposures may explain the increased risk among the
long-term employed (see below). Chimney sweeps are exposed to
high levels of particulate air pollution. Very high dust levels of 3–
19 mg/m3 were found during the most common work operations
in 1985–1986.7 High dust exposures were conﬁrmed in a recent
survey of the chimney sweeps trade: sweeping in private homes
showed an 8 h average level of inhalable dust of 3.8 mg/m3 and
sweeping in industrial settings was associated with exposures
exceeding 1 g/m3.2 Studies of air pollution in large cities have
shown an association between particulate matter <2.5 mm in
diameter and both mortality as well as non-fatal events of cardio-
vascular disease.3 Urban air pollution is derived partly from
trafﬁc and partly from heating and it is not unlikely that the high
exposure to combustion-generated particles for the chimney
sweeps may have caused the increased risk of myocardial infarc-
tion in the long-term exposed. In addition, chimney sweeps are
exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, chro-
mium, cadmium, nickel, lead and asbestos.7–9 Arsenic has been
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.10
A harmful effect of occupational exposure to combustion pro-
ducts/particles on the cardiovascular system is supported by several
earlier studies: a study of Norwegian smelter workers showed an
excess of cardiovascular disease related to tar exposure,11 and a
study
of
Canadian
aluminium
smelter
workers

a
smoking-adjusted excess of ischaemic heart disease in association

In conclusion, this study showed a strongly increased risk of
myocardial infarction among Swedish chimney sweeps com-
pared with a referent population of men of similar socio-
economic status. While the excess among the short-term
employed might be explained by excess smoking or alcohol use,
a likely explanation for the excess risk among the long-term
employed is occupational exposure to dust, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons or metals. Preventive measures to reduce hazard-
ous occupational exposures as well as smoking and alcohol use
among chimney sweeps are urgently needed.

Abstract
The conversion of waste to energy through briquetting has the potential for providing energy, while simultaneously 
reducing wastes and their environmental health risks. The current study developed and evaluated high-energy fuel 
briquettes from mixtures of coal dust, biowastes and postconsumer plastics. Five waste mix ratios (wt%) of coal dust 
(C), postconsumer plastics (P) and sawdust (S) were tested: (1) C50-40–S10, (2) C-60–P30–S10, (3) C70–P20–S10, (4) 
C-80–P20–S0 and (5) C-80A–P0–S20. Waste mix ratio had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on water absorption, shatter 
index, compressive strength and energy values, but had no effect on density. The densities (1.1–1.3 g/cm3) and shat-
ter indices (94–98%) of all briquettes conformed to international standard specifications for fuel briquettes, indicating 
that the briquettes had acceptable handling properties. A waste mixture ratio of 50% coal dust, 40% plastics and 10% 
sawdust (C50–P40–S10) produced a briquette with the best overall combination of handling and energy properties. The 
high-energy briquettes had calorific values of 26.5–33.8 MJ/kg, which were significantly higher than or comparable to 
the maximum values reported for high-energy coal (27 MJ/kg), while the compressive strength was 0.7 MPa. Potential 
applications of the briquettes include (1) household and institutional heating and cooking and (2) industrial heating in 
kilns, furnaces, smelters, curing and drying of crops (e.g., tobacco barns. Further work is required to address the following: 
(1) evaluation of the detailed physicochemical, combustion and emission properties, (2) optimization of the briquetting 
process, (3) cost estimation of the briquettes relative to existing competing solid fuels and (4) comparative performance 
evaluation of the briquettes versus conventional solid fuels in the various applications.

1  Introduction
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) experiences severe shortages 
of energy and relies on biomass fuels for household 
heating and cooking [23, 35]. The over-reliance on bio-
mass fuels partly accounts for the severe deforestation 
in SSA. Yet SSA generates large quantities of energy-rich 
biowastes and industrial and municipal solid wastes, 
posing significant human and environmental health risks 
[17, 29]. In terms of biomass availability, in Zimbabwe 
alone, approximately one million tonnes of dry biomass 
were burnt in 2012, resulting in the production of 70 
tonnes of nitrogen dioxide and 2700 tonnes of methane 
[46]. Here, we posit that waste-to-energy systems have 
the potential to address the energy and waste problems, 
which constitute a waste-energy nexus.
The conversion of waste to energy has recently 
attracted a lot of research attention in both developed 
and developing countries. Literature on waste-to-energy 
systems is dominated by studies on the pyrolysis and gasi-
fication of coal dust, plastics and biowastes as individual 
materials to produce liquid and gaseous fuels [21, 36]. 
Although solid wastes may contain high chemical energy, 
their application as fuel sources is constrained by their 
loose nature, which implies low energy value per unit vol-
ume, high transport costs and poor handling properties 
[51]. Briquetting of waste materials into solid fuels has the 
potential to overcome these challenges and enable the 
use of wastes as precursor materials for the production 
of solid fuels [10]. Briquetting is a densification process 
in which pressure is applied to loose precursor materials 
with or without a binder to obtain a compact, durable and 
high-quality solid fuel [4]. Briquetting reduces the costs 
of handling, transportation and storage and increases the 
volumetric calorific values by increasing the bulk density 
and reducing moisture content [26, 44]. The strength and 
energy properties of the briquettes depend on various fac-
tors, including (1) solid/binder ratio, (2) pressing pressure 
and time and (3) properties of the precursor materials [4, 6, 
51]. To date, some studies have investigated the develop-
ment and evaluation of fuel briquettes using biomass [4, 
20], but biomass briquettes tend to have low fixed carbon 
and low energy values [17]. A few studies have developed 
and evaluated briquettes from coal wastes [10, 41, 51]. 
However, limited data exist on the handling and energy 
properties of fuel briquettes incorporating various waste 
mixtures such as coal dust, biowastes and postconsumer 
plastics. Moreover, the capacity of low pressing pressures 
typical of manual presses and low-cost binders such as 
molasses to produce high-energy briquettes with accept-
able handling properties from such complex waste mix-
tures remains poorly understood.
In SSA, waste-to-energy systems for decentralized 
energy provisions such as the production of fuel briquettes 
from wastes should fulfill the following preconditions: (1) 
use low-cost equipment such as manual presses that can 
be fabricated locally using readily available materials, (2) 
should be operated without electricity, which is in short 
supply and often unreliable, (3) should require minimum 
skills to operate and maintain, (4) the precursor waste 
materials should be readily available for free or at a low 
cost and (5) the energy value of the briquettes should be 
similar to or higher than that of conventional solid fuels 
such as charcoal, firewood or coal. In this regard, waste-
to-energy systems that generate liquid and gaseous fuels 
via pyrolysis [40] that require complex reactor designs and 
control systems may not be ideal in SSA.
In the current study, we developed and evaluated the 
energy and handling properties of fuel briquettes incor-
porating various mixtures of coal dust, biowastes and 
postconsumer plastics using molasses as a binder. We 
hypothesized that (1) high-energy fuel briquettes with 
higher energy values than conventional solid fuels (e.g., 
firewood, coal) can be developed from waste mixtures 
using a manual press, and (2) the handling properties of 
the fuel briquettes will conform to engineering specifica-
tion. The rationale for these hypotheses is that (1) solid 
wastes such as postconsumer plastics have higher calo-
rific energy (e.g., 43.3–46.5 MJ/kg) than conventional solid 
fuels [49], and (2) briquetting of granular materials mixed 
with binders such as molasses has been reported to pro-
duce solid fuels with acceptable handling properties rela-
tive to precursor materials [51]. For example, coal dust and 
biowastes such as sawdust have energy values as high as 
34 MJ/kg and 17.4 MJ/kg, respectively [4, 24]. In addition, 
plastics easily undergo combustion as attested by anecdo-
tal evidence showing their frequent use to start domestic 
fires in Africa. The objectives of the current study were: 
(1) to develop and fabricate high-energy fuel briquettes 
consisting of various waste mix ratios, (2) to evaluate the 
handling and calorific properties of the fuel briquettes 
relative to specifications and (3) to highlight the potential 
applications of the briquettes in waste-to-energy systems 
in sub-Saharan Africa.
2  Materials and methods
2.1  Precursor waste materials
The three precursor waste materials were: (1) coal dust 
(C), (2) postconsumer plastics (P) in the form of polyeth-
ylene terephthalate (PET) bottles and (3) biowastes in 
the form of sawdust (S). Coal dust was obtained from a 
coal mining and processing plant in Hwange Colliery

and was purchased from Harare Thermal Power Station 
in Harare, Zimbabwe. The coal is mined from the Karoo 
coal deposits located in Hwange area in the mid-Zambezi 
Basin, which hosts large coal reserves in Zimbabwe [39]. 
The coal from the Hwange which was used in the current 
study has the following characteristics [31, 33]: calorific 
value: 25.4–35.0 MJ/kg, ash content: 54.7%, fixed carbon: 
23.5%, low sulfur content: 0.99% and dry ash volatile mat-
ter: 26.3%.
The PET plastics were obtained from PETRECOZIM, 
a private company that recycles PET bottles and other 
plastics. At PETRECOZIM, PET plastics are first washed 
using hot water, dried and then crushed into 144 mm2 
flakes (average dimensions: 12 mm × 12 mm). Thereaf-
ter, the PET flakes are then washed in hot water (90 °C) 
to remove residual grit and dirt and then dried. Sawdust 
was obtained from a wood workshop at the University of 
Zimbabwe campus in Harare. All precursor materials were 
further dried for 24 h before use. Coal dust and sawdust 
were passed through a 2-mm sieve to remove large parti-
cles, while waste plastics were used as obtained.
2.2  Overview of experimental work
The experimental work was conducted following the 
sequential steps summarized in Fig. 1. Briefly, this involved: 
(1) determination of waste mix ratios, (2) fabrication of 24 
briquette specimens and their subsequent preliminary 
evaluation to determine those with acceptable shatter 
indices, (3) fabrication of five briquette specimens with 
acceptable shatter indices and subsequent detailed evalu-
ation of handling properties and (4) determination of the 
calorific/energy values of three briquette specimens with 
the best handling properties. Note that the number of bri-
quettes was systematically reduced from 24 (step 2), to 5 
(step 3) and then 3 (step 4) based on testing results at each 
stage. This approach was motivated by the fact that the 
detailed evaluation of a large number of specimens (i.e., 
24) is cumbersome, time-consuming and costly. Thus, the 
systematic reduction of specimens at each step was meant 
to overcome this limitation, while achieving the desired 
high-energy briquettes.
2.3  Preliminary determination of mix ratios
A preliminary factorial experiment consisting of six waste 
mix ratios and four solid/binder ratios was conducted to 
determine the best combinations. The five preliminary 
waste mix ratios (wt%) of coal dust (C), waste plastics 
(P) and sawdust (S) were tested: (1) C60–P30–S10, (2) 
C50–P40–S10, (3) C70–P20–S10, (4) C80–P20–S0 and 
(5) C80–P0–S20. These mix ratios were selected based 
on their theoretical energy values (Eq. 1). The four solid/
binder ratios investigated were 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%

molasses. These mix ratios gave a total of 24 briquette 
specimens, each replicated three times to give a total 
of 72 specimens. Replicated (3) briquettes consisting of 
single-precursor waste materials were included as con-
trols, giving an overall total of 81 briquettes.
The five waste mix ratios were determined to give 
fuel briquettes with theoretical energy values similar to 
or higher than that of conventional solid fuels (i.e., fire-
wood, coal). To achieve this, the following energy values 
of the three precursor waste materials were obtained 
from the literature: (1) 25 to 35 MJ/kg for coal dust [31, 
33], (2) 43.3 to 46.5 MJ/kg for waste plastics [49] and (3) 
16.8–19 MJ/kg for sawdust [42]. The theoretical energy 
value of the resultant briquette was calculated as the 
sum of the product of the energy value and dry mass of 
waste in the briquette specimen (Eq. 1):
where Eb is the theoretical energy value of the resultant 
fuel briquette and Ei and Wi are the estimated energy val-
ues and proportion (wt %) of each precursor waste mate-
rial in the briquette, respectively.
2.4  Fabrication and preliminary evaluation 
of briquettes
The 81 briquette specimens were fabricated by mixing 
the appropriate waste mix ratios. The corresponding 
volume of molasses (binder) was then added to achieve 
the target solid/binder ratio. The solid/binder mixtures 
were then thoroughly mixed by hand. The briquette 
specimens were fabricated using a locally made manual 
press (Fig. 2). The manual press had a mold with internal 
dimensions that produced briquettes with a rectangular 
prism shape (225 mm length × 105 width × 65 mm thick-
ness). For each briquette specimen, 2.5 kg of the waste 
mixture was placed in the mold, and ten blows were then 
applied using a manual press. The briquettes were then 
demolded from the mold and air-dried for seven days 
before preliminary testing.
During preliminary testing, only shatter index of the 
briquettes was measured as an indicator of handling and 
strength properties. Evaluation of shatter index of the 
27 specimens yielded only five briquettes conforming 
to international standards for fuel briquettes (i.e., shat-
ter index ≥ 90%). All the five briquettes with acceptable 
shatter indices had a binder/solid ratio of 25%. Table 1 
presents the waste mix ratios of the five briquettes, 
which were subjected to detailed evaluation (Sect. 2.5).

2.5  Detailed evaluation of briquette properties
Shatter index, density, water absorption, compressive 
strength and energy values were determined to evalu-
ate the strength, water resistance and energy properties 
of briquettes. The measurement procedures for each of 
the five parameters were destructive. Therefore, for each 
of the five briquette specimens, three replicates were 
fabricated for each of the five properties, giving a total 
of 75 briquettes. All tests were conducted using standard 
procedures described in the literature (i.e., British Stand-
ards (BS), ASTM). Handling and water absorption proper-
ties were determined in laboratories in the Departments 
of Civil Engineering, and Soil Science and Agricultural 
Engineering, while calorific values were determined at 
the Institute of Mining Research at the University of Zim-
babwe campus in Harare.
2.5.1  Strength properties
The shatter index was determined using the drop test in 
accordance with BS 1016-108-108.1:1992 [11]. The initial 
mass of the briquette was measured, and the briquette 
was placed in a closed container. The container was then 
subjected to gravitational fall three times at a constant 
height of 2 m. The contents of the container were passed 
through a 2.36-mm sieve, and the mass of the briquette 
retained on the sieve was recorded. The shatter index 
was calculated as follows (Eq. 2):
where K is the shatter index (%), Bz is the mass of the bri-
quette retained (kg) and B is the initial mass of the bri-
quette (kg).
The compressive strength values were determined 
according to BS EN 12390–3:2009 [14] using a compres-
sion testing machine equipped with a digital reader at 
a load rate of 0.05 N/mm2/s. Compressive strength (CS) 
was calculated according to Eq. (3):
where CS is the compressive strength (MPa), F is the maxi-
mum compressive force applied (kN) at the point of bri-
quette failure and A is the surface area of the briquette 
­(m2).
Density (ρ, kg ­m−3) was determined according to 
ASTM-D2395 as the ratio of the mass (M, kg) to the

2.5.2  Water resistance properties
Water absorption was measured according to BS EN 13523-
25:2014 [13] to evaluate the resistance to water/humidity 
during storage and transportation. The initial dimensions 
of the briquettes were measured. The briquettes were then 
immersed in water for 10 min, and their dimensions were 
measured thereafter. The water absorption (R) was calcu-
lated as ratio of the change in dimensions after immersion 
to the initial dimensions (Eq. 5):
where R is the water absorption (%), ∆x is the change in 
dimensions after water immersion (m) and x is the initial 
dimensions before immersion (m).
Based on the water absorption results, two briquettes 
(C60–P30–S10 and C80–P0–S20) were discarded because 
they had water absorption exceeding the maximum 
acceptable value of 30%. Thus, only three briquettes, 
namely C50–P40–S10, C70–P20–S10 and C80–P20–S0, 
were taken to the next stage for the determination of calo-
rific values (Sect. 2.4.3).
2.5.3  Energy/calorific values
The energy values were determined for three briquettes 
(C50–P40–S10, C70–P20–S10 and C80–P20–S0) using a 
digital bomb calorimeter (IKA C5000) in accordance with 
BS 7420:1991 [12]. Briefly, a known mass (1 g) of the bri-
quette was placed into a crucible and placed in the bomb 
calorimeter, and then ignited. A known volume of distilled 
water was then poured into the base of the bomb which 
was charged with oxygen to 2500 kPa. The energy values 
were directly read from the digital calorimeter.
2.5.4  Indicative energy balance analysis for briquettes
In the current study, the energy required to produce the 
briquettes was not directly quantified. Energy requirement 
for briquetting is a critical parameter, but this aspect was 
inadvertently overlooked; hence, this was beyond the 
scope of the current study. Lacking experimental data, 
indicative energy requirements were estimated based on 
the literature [42]. Therefore, based on published data for 
the drying and crushing (plastics) of precursor materials 
and subsequent briquetting, an indicative energy bal-
ance analysis for the briquettes was conducted. Specifi-
cally, the following estimated energy requirements were 
(4)

used: (1) 2.25 MJ/kg for drying of each precursor material, 
(2) 0.41 MJ/kg for crushing waste plastics and (3) 0.04 to 
0.10 MJ/kg for briquetting [42]. For each briquette, the 
energy value for each process was adjusted accordingly 
to account for the proportion (wt%) of each precursor 
waste material. Using data on total energy used, and the 
energy values of the briquettes, the following ratios were 
estimated: (1) energy used to energy gained, and (2) net 
energy gained to total energy consumed. These ratios are 
proxy indicators of whether converting the waste mix-
tures into briquettes results in overall negative or positive 
energy balance.
2.6  Data analysis
The experimental design and subsequent data analysis 
used in the current study were based on univariate sta-
tistics. First, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Levene tests 
were used to evaluate the normality and homogeneity 
of data on briquette properties, respectively. Then, data 
obeying these two assumptions were subjected to a one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the effects 
of waste mix ratios on the properties of briquettes. Data 
that violated the ANOVA assumptions were either trans-
formed to attain normality and homogeneity of variance 
or analyzed using the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test. 
The least significant difference (LSD) was used to sepa-
rate means in cases where significant differences were 
observed. A one-sample t test was used to compare the 
observed mean data on briquette properties to standard 
specifications and values in the literature for conventional 
solid fuels such as coal, charcoal and firewood. All data 
analyses were done using SPSS version 16 at a probability 
level (p) of 0.05. All summary data on briquette properties 
are presented as the average ± the standard error of the 
mean of three replicates.
3  Results
3.1  Prototypes of fuel briquettes
Figure 2c, d, e shows specimens of the high-energy fuel 
briquettes developed for detailed evaluation. The bri-
quettes had a rectangular prism shape and showed no 
evidence of deformation or cracks even after curing. The 
cured briquettes were dense and easy to handle, with no 
evidence of flaking or disintegration during handling. 
These observations generally indicate that the manual 
press and waste mix ratios investigated in the current 
study can be used to produce briquettes with acceptable 
handling properties. These visual observations were con-
sistent with the results of strength properties (Sect. 3.2).

3.2  Strength properties of briquettes
Shatter index varied significantly (p = 0.002) among 
the briquettes containing the various waste mix ratios 
(Fig. 3); 70% coal dust, 20% plastics and 10% sawdust 
(C70–P20–S10) and 80% coal dust, 0% plastics and 20% 
sawdust (C80–P0–S20) gave briquettes with significantly 
higher shatter indices than those containing 60% coal dust, 
30% plastics and 10% sawdust (C60–P30–S10) and 50% 
coal dust, 40% plastics and 10% sawdust (C50–P40–S10). 
However, all briquettes had shatter indices above the mini-
mum acceptable value of 90% [10].
The densities of the briquettes were statistically similar 
(p = 0.071) among the various waste mix ratios (Fig. 4). All 
briquettes had high densities (1.1–1.3 g/cm3), which were 
about two times higher than minimum acceptable value 
of 0.6 g/cm3 [54]. This indicates the manual press provided 
adequate compressive stress to increase the density of the 
loose precursor materials.
The waste mix ratios had a significant effect (p < 0.001) 
on the compressive strength of briquettes (Fig. 5). The 
compressive strength significantly decreased in the order: 
C80–P20–S0 followed by C50–P40–S10 and C70–P20–S10, 
then C60–P30–S10 and lastly, C80–P0–S20. The compres-
sive strength values were marginal compared to the ideal 
value of 1.0 MPa for high-quality fuel briquettes [10]. Com-
parison of Figs. 3 and 4 versus Fig. 5 shows that the effects 
of waste mix ratios on compressive strength were more 
pronounced than on density and shatter index.
3.3  Water absorption properties
Waste mix ratios had a pronounced and significant effect 
(p < 0.001) on water absorption properties of briquettes 
(Fig. 6a). Three briquettes (C50–P40–S10, C70–P20–S10 
and C80–P20–S0) had acceptable water absorption values 
(< 30%) [4]. The water absorption of the three briquettes 
significantly decreased in the order: C50–P40–S10, then 
C70–P20–S10 and lastly C80–P20–S0. The remaining two 
briquettes (C80–P0–S20 and C60–P30–S10) had signifi-
cantly higher water absorption than the other three bri-
quettes. Moreover, the water absorption values for these 
two briquettes exceeded the maximum acceptable values 
for fuel briquettes. Figure 6b shows a significant inverse 
linear relationships between water absorption (WA) and 
compressive strength (CS) ( WA = −74.2 × CS + 70.6 ; 
r2 = 0.84, p < 0.001). This indicates that briquettes with low

compressive strength absorbed more moisture than those 
with higher compressive strength values.
3.4  Energy values of briquettes
Waste mix ratios had a significant effect (p = 0.041) on 
the energy value of the briquettes (Fig. 7). A briquette 
consisting of 50% coal dust, 40% waste plastics and 10% 
sawdust (C50–P40–S10) had significantly higher energy 
values than the other two briquettes. The energy values 
of C70–P20–S10 (26.5 MJ/kg) and C80–P20–S0 (27.9 MJ/
kg) were approximately two times higher than those of 
low-energy coal (~ 15 MJ/kg), but similar to that of high-
energy coal (27.9 MJ/kg). The energy value (33.8 MJ/kg) of 
the best briquette (C50–P40–S10) was significantly higher 
than that of high-energy coal. In terms of energy value, 
water absorption and strength properties, C50–P40–S10 
was the best overall briquette.
3.5  Indicative energy balance analysis 
for briquettes
Based on the estimated energy used for drying (2.25 MJ/
kg), crushing of plastics (0.41 MJ/kg) and briquetting 
(0.04–0.10 MJ/kg), the total energy consumed ranged 
from 2.29 to 2.51 MJ/kg (Table 2). C50–P40–S10 had the 
highest total energy, followed by C70–P20–S10 and then 
C80–P20–S0. As expected, higher total energy used for 
briquetting C50–P40–S10 than the other briquettes was 
attributed to the energy required for crushing a relatively 
high proportion of plastics (40%). The total energy for the 
production of briquettes accounted for just 7–9% of the 
energy value of the briquettes (26.5–33.8 MJ/kg), giving 
net energy gained of 24.07 to 31.35 MJ/kg (Table 2). Thus, 
the conversion of the waste mixtures to high-energy fuel 
briquettes increased the net energy gained by factors 
of 9.9 to 12.7. Overall, the briquettes have a positive net 
energy balance, equivalent to approximately one order of 
magnitude relative to total energy used (Table 2).

4.1  Development and fabrication of briquettes
The development of fuel briquettes from nonconventional 
precursor materials could be cumbersome and time-con-
suming due to the need to develop and evaluate a large

Research Article
number of briquette specimens with various waste mix 
ratios (i.e., a total of 81 in this case). To overcome this draw-
back, a sequential protocol was developed for the rapid 
determination of appropriate waste mix ratios of coal dust, 
biowastes and waste plastics, giving briquettes with high 
energy values and adequate handling properties. In this 
protocol, briquettes failing a given criterion at each stage 
were disregarded in subsequent steps. This generic pro-
tocol was considered ideal for developing regions such 
as SSA, because it enables rapid prototyping and saves 
resources, time and effort.
The use of readily and freely available waste materi-
als and a locally made manual press was motivated by 
the need to demonstrate the feasibility to develop high-
energy fuel briquettes using locally available resources. 
The manual press used in the current study can be fabri-
cated from scrap metal, and its estimated cost is approxi-
mately US$50. Manual hand presses similar to the one 
used in this study attain compressive pressures of approxi-
mately 0.05–4 N/mm2 [1, 34] compared to 15 N/mm2 for 
automated press systems [8]. The use of a manual press 
was motivated by the fact that some of the target end 
users of the technology in SSA (i.e., households, coop-
eratives, small-scale enterprises) often lack access to elec-
tricity, which is often expensive and unreliable. This is in 
contrast to automated press systems, which are relatively 
more expensive, require electricity and are more sophis-
ticated to design and fabricate; thus, they are not readily 
available in SSA.
4.2  Strength properties of briquettes
The shatter index indicates the percentage of fuel 
retained on a sieve of a given aperture (i.e., 2.36 mm in 
this case) after subjecting the briquettes to a drop test. 
The shatter indices for all the briquettes were high and 
above the recommended 90% (Fig. 3), indicating that the 
briquettes retained their form [9, 10]. The shatter index 
values observed in the current study are similar to those 
reported for briquettes made from biomass [4, 30] and 
coal fines [33]. The shatter index values were consistent 
with the high density observed for the briquettes (Fig. 4). 
The observed high density values (1.1–1.3 g/cm3) were 
more than three times higher than those reported by 
Lubwama and Yiga [30] for biomass briquettes made from 
groundnut shells (0.259 g/m3) and bagasse (0.183 g/m3). 
The high density values show that the waste mixtures, 
molasses binder and pressing conditions applied in the 
current study effectively densified the waste mixtures. The 
high density values indicate that the briquettes are highly 
resistant to mechanical irregularities [4].
Despite the high densities, the compressive strength 
values of the briquettes were moderate and below the 
1.0 MPa often recommended for high-quality fuel bri-
quettes (Fig. 5). Compressive strength indicates the resist-
ance of the briquettes to failure when subjected to com-
pressive forces. Although lower than the standard values 
for high-quality briquettes, the compressive strength is 
adequate to ensure that the briquettes remain intact even 
when subjected to moderate compressive forces during 
transportation and storage. The reason for the relatively 
low compressive strength are unclear. One would have 
expected that the incorporation of plastics could reduce 
the compressive strength given the plastic behavior of 
such materials, and the putative poor particle-to-particle 
contact induced by plastic flakes. However, comparison 
of the compressive strength of the briquette with no plas-
tics (i.e., 0.34 MPa for C80–P0–S20) to those with 20–40% 
plastics (i.e., 0.71 MPa for C50–P40–S10) does not support 
this notion (Fig. 5). Therefore, the compressive strength 
could reflect the complex interactions among properties 
and proportion of the precursor materials, particle–parti-
cle interactions, bonding mechanisms and compression 
process. The mechanisms accounting for the develop-
ment of strength during briquetting are highly complex 
and include (1) increasing particle-to-particle interactions 
such as particle interlocking and (2) formation of bridge-
type bonds between solid particles and molasses [4, 30, 
48]. Overall, the results indicate that the briquettes had 
adequate strength to enable handling, packaging, storage 
and transportation without significant failure.

absorption values (Fig. 6a). The water absorption is indic-
ative of the capacity of briquettes to withstand water 
or high humidity, including swelling during trans-
port and storage [4]. Two briquettes (C80–P0–S20 and 
C60–P30–S10) had water absorption above 30%; thus, 
they are likely to undergo deterioration, including swelling 
and deformation when exposed to water or high humidity 
during transport and storage. However, in some studies, 
briquettes with water absorption values of less than 50% 
per minute have been considered as acceptable [16]. A sig-
nificant inverse linear relationship was observed between 
water absorption and compressive strength (Fig. 6b). This 
relationship suggests that the water absorption capacity 
of the briquettes can be reduced by increasing the com-
pressive strength via increasing the compressive force or 
pressing time.
In briquetting, high water absorption is often associ-
ated with inherent binders such as lignin in lignocel-
lulosic biomasses and externally applied water-soluble 
organic binders such as molasses [4]. Therefore, the two 
briquettes (i.e., C80–P0–S20 and C60–P30–S10) with high 
water absorption capacities should be stored in dry condi-
tions under cover or sheds to avoid deterioration. Besides 
deterioration during storage, high water absorption influ-
ences the combustion properties and heating values of 
briquettes, especially during gasification. For example, 
water vapor in gasification processes creates saturated 
conditions at high temperatures, which may cause bri-
quettes to rapidly disintegrate [4]. In turn, this may reduce 
the overall efficiency of the system via two mechanisms: 
(1) the lose materials may exit the reactor or boiler in 
unburnt form, and (2) the materials may block the airflow 
into the reactor and interfere with the gasification process.
4.4  Energy values of briquettes
The energy values of all the three briquettes were signifi-
cantly higher than or similar to that of conventional solid 
fuels such as firewood, charcoal and coal (Fig. 7; Table 3). 
The energy values were also higher than those reported 
in the literature for biochars [47]. Biochars are formed 
through the pyrolysis of biomass, a process almost simi-
lar to that used for the production of charcoal. Table 3 
presents a comparison of the energy values of the bri-
quettes developed in the current study to conventional 
solid fuels and other briquettes reported in the literature.

Research Article
In summary, the energy values of the current briquettes 
were superior compared to briquettes reported in the 
literature. Wood, including sawdust, has relatively low 
energy values (16.8–19 MJ/kg) compared to coal dust 
and waste plastics [42]. Thus, the high energy values of 
the current briquettes could be attributed to the high 
energy values of the coal and waste plastics. The coal 
dust used in the current study was derived from high-
quality coal in Zimbabwe, with energy values ranging 
from 25 to 35 MJ/kg [31, 33]. In addition, plastics have 
been reported to have high energy values of approxi-
mately 43.3–46.5 MJ/kg, although actual values may vary 
among plastic types [49]. The high energy values make 
the briquettes ideal for various applications. Overall, 
the findings support the original hypothesis that high-
energy fuel briquettes with acceptable strength, water 
absorption and energy properties can be developed by 
using the appropriate mixtures of the three energy-rich 
precursor waste materials.
4.5  Indicative energy balance analysis
The net energy gained by briquetting waste mixtures 
exceeded the energy used for the production process by 
an order of magnitude, resulting in positive overall energy 
balances (Table 2). The ratios of energy used to energy 
gained in the current study (7.0–9.0%) were two times 
lower than the values reported for biomass briquettes 
(12.13–17.64%) [42]. The positive energy balances were 
attributed to the high energy values of the briquettes 
developed in the current study (Table 3), which were 
approximately two times those for biomass briquettes 
[37, 42]. Note that the assumed energy required for the 
drying of coal ash and sawdust (2.25 MJ/kg) was based on 
data for wet biomass with a target reduction in moisture 
content of approximately from 60 to 15% [19, 42]. There-
fore, the actual energy values for drying both coal dust 
and sawdust are expected to be lower than those for wet 
biomass. Therefore, in reality, it is likely that the energy 
required for drying, and by inference, the total energy for 
the production of the briquettes could be lower than the 
values reported here. In addition, one study even indicates 
that the energy required for compression and extrusion 
of briquettes using a hydraulic system can be as low as 
12–30 MJ/ton, equivalent to 0.12–0.30 MJ/kg [32]. Thus, 
using such hydraulic systems, scope exists to reduce the 
total energy used, and consequently, increase the ratio 
of energy gained to energy used. In summary, in terms 
of energetics, these indicative positive energy balances 
point to the feasibility of briquetting coal dust, plastics 
and biowastes into a high-energy solid fuel for potential 
applications in waste-to-energy systems.
4.6  Potential applications of briquettes 
in sub‑Saharan Africa
In summary, the superiority of the current briquettes 
includes (1) high energy values comparable to or even 
higher than conventional nonrenewable solid fuels such 
as coal, charcoal and firewood (Table 3) and (2) the puta-
tive better handling properties than the precursor granular 
materials (i.e., sawdust, coal dust, postconsumer plastics). 
In addition, briquetting solid wastes provides a potential 
solid fuel, while simultaneously reducing the health risks 
associated with current disposal practices for such solid 
wastes.
In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the bulk of the population 
lack access to the electricity grid system; thus, they rely on 
biomass fuels, contributing to deforestation [37]. In this 
regard, the high energy values of the briquettes coupled 
with adequate handling properties make them ideal alter-
natives to conventional biomass fuels such as firewood 
and charcoal. The high-energy briquettes can be used for 
household heating and cooking, either on their own, or as 
an integral part of an energy mix including conventional 
biomass fuels. At household level, the briquettes could 
be used in traditional ‘three-stone’ cookstoves commonly 
used in SSA, and even in pyrolytic or biochar cookstoves 
[22, 25]. Pyrolytic/biochar cookstoves are more energy 
efficient and release less toxic emissions than traditional 
three-stone cookstoves [22, 25]. The briquettes can also 
be used to provide energy for institutional heating and 
cooking in rural schools and clinics, which often depend 
on biomass fuels for heating and cooking.
The high-energy briquettes can also be used for indus-
trial heating systems. In SSA, high fuel demand for drying 
and curing of crops such as tea, coffee and tobacco has 
been associated with rampant deforestation in countries 
such as Zimbabwe. Moreover, the industrial production 
of fired earth bricks and cement and metallurgical pro-
cesses such as smelting are energy-intensive processes 
that require large quantities of firewood, coal or electricity. 
Therefore, the briquettes can also be used to fire industrial 
boilers, kilns, furnaces, smelters and tobacco curing barns, 
where coal and firewood are currently the predominant 
sources of energy. Examples of such industrial applica-
tions include steel production, pottery/ceramic kilns and 
cement manufacturing plants [50]. In waste-to-energy 
power plants, the briquettes can also be used as an alter-
native to coal and biomass for firing or co-firing of thermal 
power plants. Water-to-energy systems using briquettes as 
an energy source are likely to have lower environmental 
footprints than thermal power plants using conventional 
fuels such as coal and biomass. This is because the bri-
quettes use industrial wastes as precursor materials, rather 
than pristine raw materials such as coal and biomass.

The conversion of energy-rich industrial wastes to fuel 
briquettes for household, institutional and industrial appli-
cations is potentially attractive in SSA for various reasons. 
These reasons may also determine the initial uptake and 
subsequent adoption and even the sustainability of the 
briquetting technology. In summary, the reasons are as 
follows:
1.	 Besides their high energy, briquettes have several 
other potential advantages, including the simplicity of 
the production process using a low-cost manual press, 
which make them an ideal waste-to-energy technol-
ogy for developing regions such as SSA.
2.	 Acute energy shortages, dwindling firewood sources 
and lack of access to highly centralized electricity grids 
create ideal conditions for alternative fuel sources such 
as briquettes. This is particularly true in informal settle-
ments in slums, urban and peri-urban areas in SSA.
3.	 The waste feedstocks for briquetting are readily and 
freely available in SSA. For example, large coal reserves 
and coal mining operations exist in several SSA coun-
tries (e.g., in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Mozambique, 
among others), which generate enormous quanti-
ties of coal dust, currently lying idle in stockpiles. As 
Gwenzi et al., [23] and Duku et al. [18] indicated in 
the case of Zimbabwe and Ghana, respectively, large 
quantities of municipal solid wastes including post-
consumer plastics are generated annually. Moreover, 
most countries in SSA have agro-based economies, 
which generate large quantities of biowastes from 
agro-processing. These wastes are currently disposed 
of in nonengineered waste dumps or burnt, thereby 
posing human and environmental health risks. Thus, 
the briquetting technology provides a potential win–
win solution for addressing the waste-energy nexus in 
SSA.
4.	 Potential to create small enterprises and employment 
based on the briquette value chains, particularly 
among the youths in urban and peri-urban areas as 
reported in Kenya [37]. This is particularly important 
in SSA given the high unemployment rates driven by 
rapid population growth, low levels of industrialization 
and economic development.
4.7  Future research
The current study was limited to the development and 
fabrication of briquettes, and subsequent evaluation 
based on univariate statistics. Understandably, a number 
of knowledge gaps need to be addressed before the full 
potential of the briquetting technology is realized. These 
knowledge gaps include:
1.	 The need for detailed physicochemical analysis, includ-
ing chemical composition and ash properties,
2.	 The current study relied on univariate statistics (i.e., 
one-way ANOVA) to determine the waste mix ratios 
that give the briquettes with best combination of 
energy and handling properties. Therefore, system-
atic optimization of the production process is required 
using prominent optimization tools in product devel-
opment such as response surface methodology [27]. 
Such future research should investigate the effects of 
various production conditions, including waste mix 
ratios, pressing times and pressures, solid–adhesive 
ratios and their combination.
3.	 Investigating the use of heated plastic as a binder, a 
process that will require strict automated temperature 
control to allow plastics to form a liquid phase without 
generating volatiles. Such a hot briquetting technol-
ogy may enable the development of a continuous 
industrial-scale briquette production process.
4.	 Comparative studies are required to evaluate the per-
formance, including combustion characteristics and 
energy efficiencies of the high-energy briquettes ver-
sus conventional solid fuels in the various potential 
applications highlighted in the current study.
5.	 Development of a business model, including market 
analysis and detailed cost–benefit analysis of the bri-
quettes relative to existing competing solid fuels such 
as coal, charcoal and firewood.
6.	 Detailed life cycle assessment of the environmental 
footprints of the briquettes, including greenhouse 
gases and toxic emissions relative to conventional 
solid fuels.
7.	 Comprehensive assessment of the technical, financial 
and socioeconomic feasibility to determine sustain-
ability of the technology under various scenarios.
5  Conclusions and Outlook
The current proof-of-concept study showed that the calo-
rific values of the high-energy briquettes were significantly 
higher than or similar to the maximum values reported 
for conventional solid fuels such as firewood, charcoal

Research Article
high-energy briquettes with acceptable strength and 
handing properties can be developed from a mixture of 
coal dust, postconsumer plastics and biowastes using a 
simple manual press. Potential uses of the high-energy 
briquettes include household and institutional heating 
and cooking, industrial heating, curing and drying in agro-
processing, and as feedstock in water-to-energy thermal 
power plants. Given that the current briquettes were fabri-
cated using a manual press, which offered limited options 
to vary the operating conditions (e.g., pressing pressure), 
scope exists to further improve and optimize the prop-
erties by developing and using an automatic press sys-
tem. The fuel briquette technology is particularly ideal for 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including Zimbabwe for 
four reasons: (1) the existence of coal reserves and coal 
mining and processing operations generating coal dust, 
which is the main precursor material for the briquettes, (2) 
predominantly agro-based economies, generating read-
ily available biowastes and biomass, (3) large quantities 
of postconsumer plastics from the packaging industries 
and (4) acute shortages of energy, coupled with severe 
environmental pollution from poor solid waste manage-
ment practices. Thus, the fuel briquette technology could 
be a scalable and environmentally friendly win–win solu-
tion to the waste-energy nexus in sub-Saharan Africa, 
with potential to simultaneously creating value chain and 
employment opportunities. However, the evaluation of 
the briquette was limited to strength, water resistance and 
energy properties. Therefore, further work is required on 
the following: (1) the detailed physicochemical analysis, 
including chemical composition and ash properties, (2) 
combustion characteristics and analysis of environmen-
tal footprints, including quantifying toxic emissions and 
greenhouse gases, (3) optimization of the briquetting pro-
cess and (4) development of a business model, including 
market analysis and detailed cost–benefit analysis of the 
briquettes relative to existing competing solid fuels such 
as coal and firewood.

ABSTRACT
Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) in the near-roadway environment is associated with 
multiple adverse health effects. To characterize the relative contribution of tailpipe and non-tailpipe 
TRAP sources to particulate matter (PM) in the quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5–10) 
size fractions and identify their spatial determinants in southern California (CA). Month-long inte­
grated PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 samples (n = 461, 265 and 298, respectively) were collected across 
cool and warm seasons in 8 southern CA communities (2008–9). Concentrations of PM mass, 
elements, carbons and major ions were obtained. Enrichment ratios (ER) in PM0.2 and PM10 relative to 
PM2.5 were calculated for each element. The Positive Matrix Factorization model was used to resolve 
and estimate the relative contribution of TRAP sources to PM in three size fractions. Generalized 
additive models (GAMs) with bivariate loess smooths were used to understand the geographic 
variation of TRAP sources and identify their spatial determinants. EC, OC, and B had the highest 
median ER in PM0.2 relative to PM2.5. Six, seven and five sources (with characteristic species) were 
resolved in PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, respectively. Combined tailpipe and non-tailpipe traffic sources 
contributed 66%, 32% and 18% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 mass, respectively. Tailpipe traffic 
emissions (EC, OC, B) were the largest contributor to PM0.2 mass (58%). Distinct gasoline and diesel 
tailpipe traffic sources were resolved in PM2.5. Others included fuel oil, biomass burning, secondary 
inorganic aerosol, sea salt, and crustal/soil. CALINE4 dispersion model nitrogen oxides, trucks and 
intersections were most correlated with TRAP sources. The influence of smaller roadways and 
intersections became more apparent once Long Beach was excluded. Non-tailpipe emissions con­
stituted ~8%, 11% and 18% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, respectively, with important exposure and 
health implications. Future efforts should consider non-linear relationships amongst predictors when 
modeling exposures.
Implications: Vehicle emissions result in a complex mix of air pollutants with both tailpipe and non- 
tailpipe components. As mobile source regulations lead to decreased tailpipe emissions, the relative 
contribution of non-tailpipe traffic emissions to near-roadway exposures is increasing. This study 
documents the presence of non-tailpipe abrasive vehicular emissions (AVE) from brake and tire wear, 
catalyst degradation and resuspended road dust in the quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), fine and coarse 
particulate matter size fractions, with contributions reaching up to 30% in PM0.2 in some southern 
California communities. These findings have important exposure and policy implications given the 
high metal content of AVE and the efficiency of PM0.2 at reaching the alveolar region of the lungs and 
other organ systems once inhaled. This work also highlights important considerations for building 
models that can accurately predict tailpipe and non-tailpipe exposures for population health studies.

Introduction
Exposure to particulate air pollution has been associated 
with multiple adverse health outcomes and mortality in 
epidemiological studies (Pope and Dockery 2006). 
Depending on its source, composition and size distribu­
tion, particulate matter (PM) can vary in toxicity 
(Delfino et al. 2010; Strak et al. 2013). In 1992, the 
Children’s Health Study (CHS) was launched to study 
the chronic effects of air pollution exposure on the 
respiratory health of children in southern California 
(CA) communities (Gauderman, McConnell, and 
Gilliland et al. 1999; Peters et al. 1999a, 1999b; Peters, 
Thomas, and Avol et al. 1999), including lung function

and asthma (Gauderman et al. 2005; Gilliland et al. 2001; 
McConnell et al. 1999; Peters, McConnell, and Berhane 
et al. 2002). Southern CA is impacted by several natural 
and anthropogenic sources of PM, with vehicular and 
truck traffic being one of the major contributors, along 
with ports, airports, freight rail, biomass burning, dust, 
and secondary formation processes among others 
(Hasheminassab et al. 2014b).
Traffic is an especially ubiquitous source of air pollu­
tion in the region owing to a vast and complex network of 
freeways and highways, especially the I-710 with extensive 
heavy-duty diesel truck activity linking the adjacent ports 
of Long Beach and Los Angeles to major freight distribu­
tion centers across southern CA and the United States 
(Minguillon et al. 2008). Prior studies have documented 
reductions in ambient PM concentrations (PM with an 
aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 µm and 10 µm, PM2.5 
and PM10, respectively) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) in 
southern CA, largely attributed to recent emission con­
trols on traffic sources (Lurmann, Avol, and Gilliland 
2015). In turn, they have been associated with improve­
ments in lung function growth (Gauderman et al. 2015) 
and reductions in bronchitic symptoms in the CHS 
(Berhane et al. 2016). Despite these improvements, traffic- 
related air pollution (TRAP) remains an important source 
of near-roadway PM exposure in urban areas.
Vehicle emissions are a complex mix of gases, parti­
cles, volatiles and semi-volatiles, with both tailpipe and 
non-tailpipe components. They exhibit higher spatial 
and temporal variability and near-roadway gradients 
compared to overall PM mass due to more dynamic 
emission processes, dispersion and removal patterns 
(Karner, Eisinger, and Niemeier 2010). Tailpipe traffic 
emissions are generally associated with engine fossil fuel 
combustion, while non-tailpipe emissions are related to 
brake pads and tires abrasion, catalysts degradation, and 
resuspended road dust (Grigoratos and Martini 2015). 
Previous studies in Los Angeles have shown that mobile 
vehicular sources are the largest contributors to PM 
mass in the quasi-ultrafine size fraction (<0.25 µm in 
aerodynamic diameter) (Hasheminassab et al. 2013). 
Recent studies have shown that ultrafine PM is capable 
of reaching the alveolar region of the lungs once inhaled 
and crossing the air-blood barrier in the lung, thereby 
entering the circulation system and reaching other organ 
systems (Bourdrel et al. 2017; Calderón-Garcidueñas 
et al. 2019; Knibbs, Cole-Hunter, and Morawska 2011; 
Ruckerl et al. 2009; Understanding the Health Effects of 
Ambient Ultrafine Particles 2013). Similarly, gasoline 
and diesel vehicular emissions were the second largest 
contributors to PM2.5 mass (following secondary aero­
sols) (Hasheminassab et al. 2014a), and abrasive vehicu­
lar wear was the second largest contributor to coarse PM 
after mineral and crustal (soil) sources (Pakbin et al. 
2011).
Non-tailpipe abrasive vehicular wear emissions 
(AVE) are increasingly recognized as an important and 
unregulated source of toxic heavy metals in the urban 
environment 
(Adamiec, 
Jarosz-Krzeminska, 
and 
Wieszala 2016; Ferreira et al. 2016). These are hypothe­
sized to be partially responsible for adverse TRAP health 
effects (Kelly and Fussell 2012; World Health 
Organization 2013). Therefore, there is a need to 
develop exposure metrics capable of accurately assessing 
exposure to AVE components of the TRAP mixture to 
investigate their independent health effects. This is 
increasingly important as mobile source regulations 
lead to decreases in tailpipe emissions (Institute HE 
2015) despite increases in vehicle miles traveled 
(Lurmann, Avol, and Gilliland 2015; Williams et al. 
2016), resulting in larger relative contributions of non- 
tailpipe sources to total TRAP (Amato et al. 2016; 
Grigoratos and Martini 2015). However, given complex 
non-linear relationships and differing correlation struc­
tures between tailpipe and non-tailpipe TRAP compo­
nents across size fractions (Karner, Eisinger, and 
Niemeier 2010), standard geospatial metrics (e.g., dis­
tance to road) are typically poor surrogates of AVE 
exposure in the near-roadway environment.
Therefore, the first aim of this analysis is to leverage 
PM composition measurements from the CHS and 
source apportionment models to characterize the rela­
tive contribution of tailpipe and non-tailpipe TRAP 
sources to overall PM mass in the quasi-ultrafine 
(PM0.2), fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5–10) size fractions 
across southern CA. The second aim is to use general­
ized additive models (GAMs) to understand the geo­
graphic variation of these derived traffic-related PM 
sources and to identify their potential spatial determi­
nants. By examining non-linear relationships across 
a set of commonly used geospatial metrics and line 
source dispersion model estimates, future spatiotem­
poral exposure modeling efforts will be improved.
Methods
Sampling design
We used data from the CHS ‘Intra-Community 
Variation 2ʹ (ICV2) sampling campaign (Urman et al. 
2014) which was conducted in Anaheim (AN), Glendora 
(GL), Long Beach (LB), Mira Loma (ML), Riverside 
(RV), San Dimas (SD), Santa Barbara (SB) and Upland 
(UP) (Figure 1). These communities range from coastal 
areas impacted by marine vessel emissions and marine 
aerosols (SB and LB), to further inland regions impacted 
210

by traffic, freight, dairy farming and secondary aerosol 
formation (AN, UP, GL, SD, ML and RV).
Sampling protocols and quality assurance procedures 
were described in detail in Fruin et al. (2014) and are 
summarized here. Month-long chemistry samples were 
obtained from two consecutive 2-week integrated sam­
ples between November 2008 and December 2009 in 
cool (Oct–Mar) and warm (Apr–Sep) seasons using 
a rotating deployment schedule (Figure 2) at up to 46 
locations per community (Supplement Table 1), with 
the exception of SB where local wildfire events resulted 
in a single round of two-week integrated samples. 
Sampling locations monitored included CHS partici­
pants’ residences, schools and central site stations to 
capture local, neighborhood and regional scale variation 
in air pollution, respectively. Additional sampling was 
conducted at the central sites to ensure more complete 
temporal coverage. Selection of residence locations 
within communities was based on maximizing the 
expected variability in traffic source impacts based on 
earlier modeling (Franklin et al. 2012) and line source 
dispersion models (Benson 1992).
Two modified Harvard Cascade Impactors (Lee et al. 
2006) with 0.2 µm, 0.5 µm, 2.5 µm and 10 µm cut-points 
were used to collect two-week integrated PM0.2, 
PM0.2–2.5 (defined as the sum of PM0.2–0.5 and 
PM0.5–2.5) and PM2.5–10 samples at a flow rate of 5 liters 
per minute (lpm). Polyurethane foam (PUF) (Kavouras

and Koutrakis 2001) was used as the impaction substrate 
in all stages except for the final 0.2 µm stage, where 37- 
mm Teflon or quartz filters were used. In addition, 
a Harvard Personal Environmental Monitor (H-PEM) 
was used to collect PM2.5 on pre-baked quartz filters at 
1.8 lpm (Supplement Figure S1). Both the PUF sub­
strates and Teflon filters were specially pre-cleaned to 
remove inorganic and organic contaminants that might 
compromise quantification at the low levels needed for 
this study.
Chemical analyses
PM2.5–10 (coarse), PM0.2–2.5 (accumulation mode) and 
PM0.2 (quasi-ultrafine) mass were determined from 
stage 2 PUFs, stage 3 + 4 PUFs and stage 5 Teflon filters, 
respectively, using reference gravimetric methods. 
A nylon backup filter was placed behind the Teflon filter 
in stage 5 to capture volatile nitrate losses, and fine and 
quasi-ultrafine masses were corrected accordingly. To 
obtain PM2.5 (fine) mass and composition, PM0.2 and 
PM0.2–2.5 were summed for all chemical analyses. 
Similarly, PM10 mass was calculated as the sum of 
PM2.5–10 and PM2.5. For consistency with the literature 
and ease of presentation, PM2.5–10 will subsequently be 
referred to as the coarse size fraction, PM2.5 as the fine 
and PM0.2 as the quasi-ultrafine fraction, respectively.
The concentrations of 48 elements (both total and 
water-soluble) in each size fraction were determined by 
magnetic-sector inductively coupled plasma mass- 
spectroscopy (SF-ICP-MS; Thermo-Fisher Element 2) 
in the Trace Element Cleanroom Facility at the 
Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) 
(Clements et al. 2014; Daher et al. 2013; Hays et al. 
2011; Okuda, Schauer, and Shafer 2014). For the total 
analyses, PM was completely solubilized with a mixture 
of ultra-pure nitric, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric 
acids using an automated microwave-aided digestion 
system (Milestone Ethos Plus). The reported total 
uncertainties in the elemental data incorporate the 
three major sources of uncertainty (SF-ICPMS mea­
surements, method blank subtraction, and digestion 
recovery). Elemental and organic carbon concentra­
tions (EC and OC, respectively) in the quasi-ultrafine 
and fine fraction (not available in coarse) were deter­
mined from quartz filters using the thermal-optical 
transmittance method (TOT NIOSH method 5040). 
Quartz filters were also used to determine water- 
soluble organic carbon (wsOC) concentration in these 
two size fractions using a GE/Sievers 900 TOC 
Analyzer. Insoluble OC (isOC) was then calculated as 
the difference between total OC (from EC/OC mea­
surement) and wsOC. Soluble, major cations (sodium, 
ammonium and potassium) and anions (chloride, 
nitrate, phosphate and sulfate) were analyzed following 
water extraction of Teflon filters by ion chromatogra­
phy (IC) at secondary sites only, defined as schools and 
central sites.
A summary of the data available in each size fraction 
at the individual participant residences, schools and 
central sites is presented in Supplement Table S2. Due 
to cost considerations, only samples from the quasi- 
ultrafine size fraction were analyzed in full, and approxi­
mately half of the filters in the fine and coarse size 
fractions were analyzed (selected evenly across seasons). 
In all analyses, standard QA/QC procedures were fol­
lowed, including lab and method blank corrections, 10% 
duplicate samples and sample spikes.
Geospatial traffic variables
In order to further understand spatial determinants of 
traffic-related PM sources and inform future spatiotem­
poral modeling efforts, the following commonly used 
geospatial metrics of TRAP were utilized. These capture 
spatial variability in different aspects of the traffic mix, 
including volume, speed and density, tailpipe and non- 
tailpipe signals, light and heavy-duty vehicles, and stop- 
and-go versus free-flowing traffic.
The California Line Source Dispersion (CALINE4) 
model was used to estimate nitrogen oxides (NOx) con­
centrations at sampling locations contributed from local 
on-road vehicle emissions on freeways/highways and 
non-freeways/highways (major and minor roads) within 
5 km during the 4-week sampling period, hereafter 
referred to as “fwy/hwy NOx” and “non-fwy/hwy NOx, 
” respectively (Benson 1992, 1989). The advantage of 
CALINE4 is that it incorporates local traffic volumes, 
emissions from light and heavy-duty vehicles and 
meteorology (wind direction and speed) in estimating 
NOx 
concentrations 
at 
receptor 
sites 
using 
a deterministic Gaussian plume dispersion model. 
CALINE4 is well suited for estimating vehicle emissions 
concentrations downwind of roadways on the local scale 
(Benson 1992; Franklin et al. 2012) and on-road freeway 
concentrations (Fruin et al. 2011; Westerdahl et al. 2005; 
Zhu et al. 2002, 2006).
Traffic density was calculated as distance-decayed 
Annual Average Daily Traffic volume in both directions 
from all roads within a 300 m circular buffer using 
a kernel density function with a 300 m search radius 
and 10 m grid resolution. Total road length was calcu­
lated as the sum of the length of all roads within a 300 m 
radius buffer. Truck percent was calculated as the frac­
tion of heavy-duty vehicles on the nearest freeway 
(FCC1 road class).
212
R. HABRE ET AL.
In addition, count of street intersections was calcu­
lated by first spatially intersecting 2014 Census Tiger 
line files for all roads to create intersection points, then 
removing end of road points and points intersecting 
limited access highways and ramps in ArcMap 10.5. 
This resulted in a points layer of intersections along 
roads (Figure 3), which were then summed within 
a 250 m or 500 m buffer around each sampling location.
Data analysis
Enrichment ratios
In addition to descriptive statistics and non-parametric 
correlations, enrichment ratios (ER) (Austin et al. 2013; 
Landsberger et al. 1992; Parviainen et al. 2020) were 
calculated for each element to indicate its contributions 
in the PM0.2 and the PM10 size fractions relative to 
PM2.5, as follows: 
ERij0:2=2:5 ¼ ðXij0:2=PMj0:2Þ= Xij2:5=PMj2:5
 
(1) 
ERij10=2:5 ¼ ðXij10=PMj10Þ= Xij2:5=PMj2:5
 
(2) 
Where Xij is the concentration of species i in sample j. 
Median ER’s were then calculated for all species across 
all samples and plotted. These ratios reveal information 
about predominant emission or formation processes, 
where ratios approaching one indicate elements that 
are equally enriched in PM2.5. We expect elements 
related to primary fresh combustion (potentially also 
secondary formation) to be smaller in size (<1 µm) and 
more enriched in PM0.2 relative to PM2.5 (median 
ER0.2/2.5 > 1); while we expect elements related to crustal 
and mechanical abrasion sources to be larger in size and 
more enriched in PM10 relative to PM2.5 (median 
ER10/2.5 > 1) (Hidy 2019).
Source apportionment using the EPA positive matrix 
factorization model
We used the EPA Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA 
PMF v5.0) (Norris et al. 2014; Paatero and Tapper 1994) 
model to apportion measured PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 
mass concentrations into their major contributing 
“sources” or “source groups” (Norris et al. 2014; 
Paatero and Tapper 1994). Methods are briefly described 
here, and additional details are included in the supple­
ment for reference. The PMF model solves the following 
equation: 
xij ¼
X
p
k¼1
gikfkj þ eij
(3) 
where xij is the concentration of species j in sample i, gik 
is the mass contribution of factor k to sample i, fkj is the 
loading of species j on factor k and eij is the residual 
error for sample i and species j. PMF solves eq. (3) by 
minimizing the following object function (Q) iteratively 
using the Multilinear Engine v2 (ME-2): 
Q ¼

213
where uij is the uncertainty of species j in sample i. 
Therefore, each observation is individually weighted by 
its uncertainty. Furthermore, elements of the G and 
F matrix are restricted to being positive (or non- 
significantly negative).
Two files were prepared to input to EPA PMF v5.0 – 
a concentrations file and a sample-specific uncertainties 
file – for each of the three size fractions. Sample-specific 
analytical uncertainties were provided by WSLH for 
metals, OC, EC, wsOC and ions. Any missing concen­
trations (and in turn uncertainties) were replaced by 
overall species-specific medians in PMF. Uncertainty 
values of zero were replaced by a low value (10−6 ng/m3).
Per PMF guidelines, “Strong” and “Weak” species 
were included in the analysis and “Bad” species were 
excluded, based on their signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) as 
follows: “Strong” S/N ≥ 3, “Weak” 1 ≤ S/N < 3 and 
“Bad” S/N < 1 (Supplement Table S3). Setting species 
as “Weak” increases their uncertainty by a factor of 3. 
However, some exceptions were made to exclude spe­
cies as follows: Lu in PM0.2 (S/N = 1.1); Se in all three 
size fractions (high frequency of missing data); and 
As, W and chloride ion in PM0.2; Cr in both PM0.2 
and PM2.5 for undue influence on the solution result­
ing in factor smearing. Out of all available samples, 
6.5% (30 out of 461), 5.7% (15 out of 250) and 1% (3 
out of 298) were excluded as outliers from the analy­
sis based on species’ concentrations in PM0.2, PM2.5 
and PM2.5–10, respectively.
An additional 10% modeling uncertainty was added 
to all runs to account for sampling and modeling errors 
not captured in the analytical uncertainties. Five to nine 
factors were attempted for all size fractions, and the 
optimal factor number was chosen based on the solution 
with the most physically interpretable results and least 
factor smearing. Solution stability evaluation, rotations, 
and uncertainty evaluations are described in further 
detail in the supplement. Factors were identified based 
on the loading of species in their profiles and knowledge 
of expected spatial and temporal patterns in their 
contributions.
Spatial variation and determinants of traffic-related 
PM sources
Given the complex and often non-linear correlations of 
traffic-related, tailpipe and non-tailpipe PM sources 
across size fractions, we further investigated their spatial 
variation and potential determinants to identify top 
candidate predictors and inform future exposure mod­
eling efforts. Predicted contributions for traffic-related 
sources were first averaged for each sampling location to 
remove the influence of any temporal factors in this 
spatial analysis.
The MapGAM package (Bai et al. 2019) in R (Team RC 
2019) was used to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) 
of traffic-related PM sources. The utility of these nonpara­
metric GAMs is in their ability to capture non-linear 
relationships among covariates (or predictors) and to 
generate smooth prediction surfaces that can reveal 
more complex relationships than standard linear 
approaches. In other words, GAMs allow the effect of 
variables on predicted sources to change or vary at differ­
ent levels of the predicted source, rather than remain 
static or fixed. All variables were standardized (mean = 0, 
standard deviation = 1) to ensure they were on a similar 
scale since the loess smooth uses a spherical (isotropic) 
neighborhood when establishing nearest neighbors, and 
Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated.
Primary models included a bivariate loess smooth 
term with latitude and longitude to examine spatial 
variability in these sources (or whether geographic 
location was a significant predictor of these sources). 
In secondary analyses, geospatial metrics were used in 
the bivariate smooth (instead of geographic coordi­
nates) to examine the combined “mixture” effect of 
two parameters at a time on predicted sources. The 
optimal span for each model was determined by 
searching from 0.10 to 0.90 in 0.05 increments. 
Predictions were generated and mapped across an 
equally spaced grid over the study domain with black 
contour lines indicating regions with significantly 
higher (red) or lower (blue) levels at an alpha = 0.05 
level. In sensitivity analyses, Long Beach was excluded 
to examine its influence on observed patterns since it 
has some of the highest heavy-duty truck activity in the 
region, which might overshadow smaller signals from 
light-duty vehicles.
Finally, a significance threshold of p-value < .0005 for 
the non-parametric loess term (ANOVA F test) was 
used as a conservative approach to protect against 
chance findings due to multiple testing. For brevity, 
only models with a clear pattern of change in the pre­
dicted source along both x and y dimensions (when 
x and y are two geospatial metrics) and a more stringent 
p-value < .0001 for the “mixture” effect are reported in 
the main manuscript; remaining significant models are 
included in the supplement.

of elemental species across size fractions are also provided 
in Supplement Figure S2.
On average, EC constituted 15.8% and 6.3% of ultra­
fine and fine PM mass, respectively, while OC consti­
tuted 46.9% and 19.9% of the ultrafine and fine PM 
mass, respectively. The soil-related elements Y, Sc, Dy, 
Al, and Ho had the highest median enrichment ratios in 
PM10 compared to PM2.5; whereas, B, EC, and OC – 
species related to vehicular traffic tailpipe emissions – 
had the highest median enrichment ratios in the PM0.2

compared to the PM2.5 (Figure 4). The elements As, Pb, 
Tl, V and Cd were also some of the most enriched in 
PM0.2 compared to PM2.5 which reflects the relatively 
high volatility of these elements. The distribution of 
enrichment ratios for all species is presented in 
Supplement Table S4.
Source apportionment
PMF solutions and model performance
A total of six, seven and five factors were selected as the 
optimal, physically interpretable solutions in PMF. 
These factors together explained 63%, 86% and 88% of 
the variability in PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 mass, 
respectively (Table 2).
R2’s for individual species and tests of normality for 
the residuals are presented in Supplement Table S5. In 
general, R2’s were lowest in the quasi-ultrafine size frac­
tion, likely due to the lower concentrations and greater 
challenges in measuring mass concentrations accurately 
in this size fraction, with the exception of a few species 
(V, S, Zn, Rh, La, etc.) with the highest R2 in the quasi- 
ultrafine fraction.
In initial runs, including Cr in the model resulted in 
a single Cr factor with highest contributions in SB and 
LB, both coastal communities, with remaining uninter­
pretable, smeared factors. While the Cr signal could be 
related to chromium plating, Cr was ultimately set to 
“Bad” and excluded from the PM0.2 and PM2.5 model 
solutions to obtain physically interpretable solutions. 
Similarly, keeping As and W in the PM0.2 model resulted 
in them separating into a single factor with zero (negli­
gible) estimated mass.
Predicted source profiles and contributions
PMF-resolved factors were identified based on their 
loading profiles (Figure 5, and Supplement Figure S3 
for individual plots of factor profiles) and spatial and 
temporal patterns in their source contributions 
(Supplement Figures S4.A and S4.B, respectively).
Mean predicted source contributions by size fraction 
overall and by community are shown in Figures 6 and 7, 
respectively.
The study communities (as shown in Figure 1) range 
from coastal areas heavily impacted by primary marine 
vessel, port and traffic emissions with cooler tempera­
tures and predominantly Westerly winds, to commu­
nities further inland with more significant impacts of 
secondary aerosol formation as a result of higher tem­
peratures and conditions favoring photochemical reac­
tions (Daher et al. 2013). In general, some categories of 
sources were identified in all three size fractions – such 
as abrasive vehicular emissions (AVE) and secondary 
inorganic PM (ammonium nitrates and ammonium sul­
fates); whereas, others were only distinguishable in 
a single size fraction (e.g., biomass burning).
Quasi-ultrafine PM sources. The six sources resolved in 
the quasi-ultrafine size fraction consisted of the follow­
ing: “Traffic” constituted 58.2% of the PM0.2 mass and 
had high loadings of EC, wsOC, isOC and B. Boron is 
a known gasoline fuel additive (Shah, Glavatskih, and 
Antzutkin 2013). “Fuel Oil” had the highest loadings of 
Ni and V and contributed 8.3% of the PM0.2 mass, with 
the highest contributions in the port community of LB. 
“Crustal” had high loadings of Al, Ca, Yb and Ho and 
contributed 9.2% of the PM0.2 mass. “Biomass Burning”

was marked with high loading of K, Rb and wsOC and 
contributed 11.1% of the PM0.2 mass with higher con­
tributions in the cool season (Figure 8). “Abrasive 
Vehicular Emissions” (AVE) contributed 7.7% of the 
PM0.2 mass and was marked by high loadings of tire, 
brake and catalyst wear markers Ba, Cu, Mo, Sb, Zn, Pt 
and Pd. It is important to note that this factor is named 
“AVE” given the high loadings of brake and tire abrasion 
markers; however, it also contains the platinum group 
metals Pt, Pd and Rh which are typically released from 
the attrition of catalysts through the tailpipe. This dis­
tinction applies to all subsequent references to “AVE” 
sources. “Ammonium Sulfates” had high loading of 
lanthanum (La), a marker of petroleum refineries emis­
sions (Kulkarni, Chellam, and Fraser 2007), in addition 
to ammonium ion and sulfur (S) and contributed 5.5% 
to the PM0.2 mass. Contributions were higher in the 
warm season (Figure 8).
Fine PM sources. In the PM2.5 size fraction, seven 
source factors were resolved as follows: “Ammonium 
Sulfates” with high loadings of La and S, possibly related 
to secondary formation from petroleum refineries and 
industrial emissions (Kulkarni, Chellam, and Fraser 
Figure 5. Source profiles (in % of species) in the quasi-ultrafine, fine and coarse PM size fractions.
JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION

2007). It contributed 22.8% of the total PM2.5 mass. Two 
tailpipe traffic sources were identified in PM2.5 – “Traffic 
(gasoline)” with loadings of wsOC, isOC and B (15% of 
the mass) and “Traffic (diesel)” with loadings of EC and 
barium (Ba) (5.9% of the mass). “Traffic (gasoline)” was 
elevated in most communities with major freeways (SB, 
ML, SD, UP) while “Traffic (diesel)” was elevated in 
communities with truck activity (LB, AN, SD, GL). 
“Sea Salt” also contributed 15.9% of PM2.5 mass, with 
loadings of Na, Cl and Mg, and highest contributions in 
Figure 6. Percent contribution of A) all PMF-predicted sources to total PM mass and B) tailpipe and non-tailpipe sources to total traffic- 
related PM mass in each size fraction (averaged across all communities).

the coastal community of SB. “Abrasive Vehicular 
Emissions” (AVE) was also resolved, with an 11.4% 
contribution to mass and high loadings of Ag, Mo, Zn, 
Ni, V, Pt and Rh. This factor was highest in communities 
with significant truck and freight activity (LB, ML, AN), 
and the presence of Ni and V here suggests a certain 
degree of collinearity with fuel oil sources originating 
from source areas in close proximity (i.e., the ports) 
(Habre, Coull, and Koutrakis 2011). “Crustal” (19% of 
PM2.5 mass) was also resolved with Al, Dy and Fe – 
elements related to soil – and highest contributions in 
the inland, arid community of ML with agricultural and 
dairy production. Finally, a factor related to secondary 
inorganic PM formation was identified with high load­
ings of ammonium, nitrate and chloride (“Ammonium 
Nitrate/Ammonium Chloride”). It contributed ~10% of 
PM2.5 mass and had highest contributions in the cool 
season in RV (Figure 8). This is a result of ammonia 
(NH3) reactions with nitric and hydrochloric acid, 
which is shown to favor formation of ammonium nitrate 
and ammonium chloride especially in cold conditions 
(Kelly et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2015).
Coarse PM sources. Finally, in the PM2.5–10 size frac­
tion, the following five sources were resolved: “Crustal 
(fertilized soil)” with Al, Ca, Dy, K, Rb and P loadings 
contributing 15.6% of the mass with highest concentra­
tions inland in ML. “Ammonium Nitrate” (17.6% of 
mass) had highest contributions inland as well, down­
wind of the dairy farms producing ammonia in ML and 
RV and was somewhat higher in the cool season (Figure 
8). “Abrasive Vehicular Emissions” (AVE) with Cu, Ba, 
Mo, Sb, Rh, and Pt contributed 18% of the PM2.5–10 mass 
and was highest in LB, AN and ML. The presence of 
some crustal elements (Al, Ca) here also suggests some 
mixing with road dust. “Sea Salt” with Na, chloride and 
S (22.7% of mass) was highest in SB and LB. Finally, 
“Ammonium Sulfate” contributing 26.1% of the mass 
was higher in the warm season, with ammonium, nitrate 
and S (Figure 8).
Detailed results examining the variability in the PMF 
solution by bootstrapping, displacement analyses or 
Fpeak rotation are presented in Supplement Table S6. 
Briefly, PM0.2 sources were minimally displaced in these 
evaluations; whereas, diesel traffic exhibited some swap­
ping (13%) with AVE, and secondary ammonium nitrate/ 
chloride with crustal (10%) in PM2.5 Fpeak bootstraps. 
Finally, the crustal source mapped to AVE in 18% of 
Fpeak bootstraps in PM2.5–10 implying greater difficulty 
in distinguishing these two sources in the coarse fraction.
Overall, tailpipe and non-tailpipe traffic-related 
sources together contributed around 66%, 32% and 
18% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 mass, respectively; 
with non-tailpipe AVE sources contributing around 8%, 
11% and 18% of PM mass, respectively. Tailpipe traffic 
sources were resolved in PM0.2 and PM2.5 only, as one

source in PM0.2 and as two gasoline and diesel sources 
with differentiated source profiles in PM2.5. Non-tailpipe 
traffic sources were resolved in all three size fractions 
with similar chemical signatures, although with some 
collinearity with diesel traffic (in PM2.5) and crustal (in 
PM2.5–10).
Spearman correlation coefficients between the 
resolved PM sources are presented in Supplement 
Table S7. Fuel oil (PM0.2) was correlated with sea 
salt (PM2.5) likely due to the proximity of their 
sources (ports and ocean). Sea salt in PM2.5 and 
PM2.5–10 had a 0.67 correlation. Tailpipe combus­
tion-related traffic sources in PM0.2 and PM2.5 were 
not highly correlated suggesting they are potentially 
capturing 
different 
components 
of 
the 
traffic 
mixture. Whereas, non-tailpipe AVE sources exhib­
ited high correlations with each other across all 
three size fractions (>0.79).
Location as a predictor of tailpipe and non-tailpipe 
traffic sources
Predicted surfaces from GAM models using geographic 
location as a bivariate smooth to predict standardized levels 
of traffic-related sources are shown in Figure 9A (all com­
munities) and Figure 9B (excluding Long Beach).
Tailpipe traffic in PM0.2 was generally elevated across 
the basin, while gasoline traffic in PM2.5 showed elevated 
levels in areas close to SB, GL, SD and UP – all commu­
nities with important freeway and highway traffic

activity. In contrast, diesel traffic in PM2.5 was elevated 
around LB and further inland toward ML along the 
truck and freight transport corridor. Non-tailpipe AVE 
sources exhibited generally similar patterns in space 
across all size fractions and were highest in the core, 
coastal area of the basin with the most primary emis­
sions. However, when LB was excluded from the analy­
sis, spatial patterns for tailpipe TRAP sources generally 
remained similar but increased in range (greater pre­
dicted levels) in an expected direction (greater where 
freeways/highways are located, and greater around LB 
for diesel traffic in PM2.5). Spatial patterns of non- 
tailpipe AVE sources changed dramatically with higher 
predicted levels further inland in PM0.2, in the urban 
core for PM2.5 and across the entire modeling domain 
for PM2.5–10. The maximum predicted range of AVE 
also decreased in PM2.5 and PM2.5–10.
Geospatial metrics as potential predictors of 
traffic-related PM sources
The distribution of geospatial metrics is presented in 
Supplement Table S7. Spearman correlations between 
the traffic-related sources (averaged in space and stan­
dardized) and geospatial metrics are shown in 
Supplement Tables S8.A (all communities) and S8.B 
(excluding Long Beach).

Tailpipe traffic in PM0.2 was most correlated with 
intersections within 500 m and 250 m (r = 0.31 and 
r = 0.29, respectively) followed by total road length 
(300 m) (r = 0.22). These correlations became stron­
ger once LB was excluded (r up to 0.42 with intersec­
tions (500 m)). It was also moderately inversely 
correlated with gasoline traffic in PM2.5 (r = −0.18 
overall, r = −0.34 excluding LB), but positively corre­
lated with diesel traffic in PM2.5 (r = 0.12 overall, 
r = 0.27 excluding LB). In general, geospatial metrics 
had low negative correlations with the gasoline traffic 
source but were positively correlated with the diesel 
traffic source in PM2.5, with fwy/hwy NOx (r = 0.55), 
non-fwy/hwy NOx (r = 0.46) and traffic density 
(300 m) (r = 0.43) showing the highest correlations 
(even when LB was excluded).
In addition, non-tailpipe AVE in PM2.5–10 and PM0.2 
were most correlated with fwy/hwy NOx (r = 0.67 and 
r = 0.50, respectively, similarly once LB was excluded). 
Whereas, AVE in PM2.5 was most strongly correlated 
with truck percent on nearest FCC1 (freeway) even once 
LB was excluded. Non-fwy/hwy NOx was also more 
highly correlated with AVE in PM2.5–10 (r = 0.62) and 
PM2.5 (r = 0.32) compared to PM0.2 (r = 0.26).
Bivariate relationships between geospatial metrics 
and traffic-related PM sources
Supplement Figure 10 shows predicted standardized 
values of select tailpipe (Supplement Figure 10A) and 
non-tailpipe (Supplement Figure 10B), traffic-related 
PM sources as a function of two geospatial metrics 
(mixtures) where p-value < .0001. All remaining GAM 
models with p-value < .0005 for the bivariate loess 
smooth term are presented in Supplement Figures S5. 
A (all communities) and S5.B (excluding Long Beach) 
and Supplement Table S10.
Simultaneous 
increases 
in 
fwy/hwy 
NOx 
and 
truck percent, or in intersections (250 m) and 
truck percent, were associated with higher predicted levels 
of tailpipe diesel traffic in PM2.5. A similar pattern was 
observed with non-fwy/hwy NOx and truck percent. The 
prediction range for models including truck percent 
dropped once LB was excluded, and patterns remained 
similar except the relationship between truck percent and 
non-fwy/hwy NOx on diesel traffic (PM2.5) became less 
apparent.
As for tailpipe traffic in PM0.2, the effect of 
a simultaneous increase in non-fwy/hwy NOx and inter­
sections (250 m) became apparent only once LB was 
excluded (Supplement Figure S5.B).
Similarly, for non-tailpipe AVE sources (Supplement 
Figure 10B), simultaneous increases in fwy/hwy NOx 
and truck percent, or in non-fwy/hwy NOx and inter­
sections (500 m) were associated with higher AVE in 
PM2.5–10 
and 
PM2.5. 
The 
interaction 
between 
truck percent and non-fwy/hwy NOx was most apparent 
in PM0.2. Excluding LB resulted in attenuated but still 
significant influence of truck percent in general, and 
greater influence of non-fwy/hwy NOx in all size frac­
tions, especially as intersections (250 m and 500 m) 
increased in PM0.2.
Discussion
In this analysis, we were able to distinguish and quantify 
the contribution of tailpipe and non-tailpipe traffic-related 
sources among other major primary and secondary sources 
of PM in southern CA, in the quasi-ultrafine (PM0.2), fine 
(PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5–10) size fractions. We found that 
overall traffic-related sources contributed ~66%, 32% and 
18% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 mass, respectively, with 
the PM2.5–10 traffic contribution consisting entirely of non- 
tailpipe AVE. We resolved distinct gasoline versus diesel 
tailpipe traffic profiles in PM2.5, while non-tailpipe AVE 
sources had similar chemical signatures in all three size 
fractions and exhibited some collinearity with diesel traffic 
in PM2.5 and crustal in PM2.5–10.
We also found that the spatial distribution of 
tailpipe traffic sources in PM0.2 and PM2.5 was simi­
lar. Higher predicted gasoline traffic emissions 
(PM2.5) were observed in areas with major freeways 
and highways, and higher predicted diesel traffic 
emissions (PM2.5) were more localized around the 
ports and cargo movement activities in LB and 
further inland. Long Beach, with its extensive heavy- 
duty truck traffic activity, had a strong influence on 
observed spatial patterns of non-tailpipe AVE in all 
size fractions, pulling the highest predicted AVE 
levels toward the port area and urban core. Once 
excluded, the impact of inland freeways and high­
ways and light-duty vehicular traffic areas became 
more apparent on AVE in PM0.2 and PM2.5, while 
predicted AVE in PM2.5–10 was elevated across the 
entire 
basin 
(although 
the 
prediction 
range 
decreased).
Similarly, using bivariate GAMs to model non-linear 
relationships between commonly used geospatial metrics 
and traffic-related sources, several mixture effects were 
revealed that would not have otherwise been apparent 
using standard linear correlations or approaches. Below 
we discuss our findings in more detail, starting with our 
general source apportionment modeling results followed 
by a more focused discussion of tailpipe and non-tailpipe 
traffic sources and their determinants.
222
R. HABRE ET AL.
Overall source apportionment findings
Our PMF modeling results are in agreement with pre­
viously published literature from southern CA (Arhami 
et al. 2009; Cheung et al. 2011a, 2011b; Christoforou 
et al. 2000; Daher et al. 2013; Hasheminassab et al. 
2014a, 2014b, 2013). We found traffic to be the largest 
contributor to PM0.2 mass (Hasheminassab et al. 2013), 
while secondary aerosol (ammonium nitrates and 
ammonium sulfates) contributed the most to PM2.5 
mass (Hasheminassab et al. 2014a, 2014b), followed by 
primary gasoline and diesel vehicular emissions 
(Hasheminassab et al. 2014a). However, while other 
studies found mineral and crustal material contributed 
the most to PM2.5–10 followed by abrasive vehicular 
wear, in our work, secondary aerosol (~44%) contribu­
ted slightly more than the crustal (fertilized soil) and 
AVE sources combined (~33%) (Cheung et al. 2011a, 
2011b; Pakbin et al. 2011). We also resolved fuel oil in 
PM0.2 (which has been extensively documented as 
a result of heavy fuel oil use in marine vessels and port 
operations in Long Beach (Arhami et al. 2009; 
Minguillon et al. 2008), biomass burning (PM0.2) 
(Hasheminassab et al. 2014b; Minguillon et al. 2008), 
crustal (in all size fractions, distinguished by an addi­
tional fertilizer signal in PM2.5–10 likely due to agricul­
tural 
activity 
in 
Mira 
Loma) 
and 
sea 
salt 
(Hasheminassab et al. 2014b; Sowlat, Hasheminassab, 
and Sioutas 2016).
As for secondary inorganic aerosols, ammonium sul­
fate was resolved in all size fractions with high loadings 
of La in PM0.2 and PM2.5, suggesting emissions from 
petroleum refineries are contributing to secondary PM 
(Du and Turner 2015; Kulkarni, Chellam, and Fraser 
2007). Ammonium sulfate is formed as a result of 
a series of reactions between sulfur dioxide and ammo­
nia (ammonium) under warmer temperature condi­
tions, which also favor photochemical ozone formation 
(Christoforou et al. 2000; Hasheminassab et al. 2014b; 
Schiferl, Heald, and Nowak et al. 2014). Ammonium 
nitrates were resolved in PM2.5 (with ammonium chlor­
ide) and PM2.5–10. Ammonium nitrate forms as a result 
of ammonia and nitric acid reactions under cool tem­
peratures which shift the equilibrium into the particle 
phase. Ammonia is emitted from upwind agricultural 
and dairy production in Mira Loma, while nitric acid is 
formed as a result of the oxidation of nitric oxides 
emitted from primary fuel combustion sources (Wang 
et al. 2015; Ying and Kleeman 2006; Ying, Lu, and 
Kleeman 2009). Coarse nonvolatile sodium nitrate is 
also formed by heterogeneous replacement of chloride 
by nitrate in coarse sea-salt particles (Gard, Kleeman, 
and Gross et al. 1998) which may explain the large 
percentage 
of 
secondary 
aerosol 
in 
PM2.5–10. 
Ammonium chloride can also form under similar con­
ditions as a result of hydrochloric acid reactions with 
ammonia (Hayes, Ortega, and Cubison et al. 2013; Kelly 
et al. 2013; Schiferl, Heald, and Nowak et al. 2014; Wang 
et al. 2015).
Tailpipe traffic sources
Gasoline and diesel tailpipe traffic was resolved as 
one combined source in PM0.2 and as two distinct 
sources in PM2.5. Boron, a gasoline fuel additive 
(Shah, Glavatskih, and Antzutkin 2013, 2012), loaded 
on both PM0.2 traffic and PM2.5 gasoline traffic 
sources; while EC, a marker of diesel combustion, 
loaded on both PM0.2 traffic and PM2.5 diesel traffic 
sources (Christoforou et al. 2000; Lough and Schauer 
2007). Overall, despite referring to these sources as 
tailpipe traffic (from on-road vehicles), it is possible 
for them to have captured some of the contributions 
of gasoline or diesel-operated off-road mobile vehi­
cular sources impacting these receptor locations if 
they share similar chemical signatures.
Of these sources, PM2.5 diesel traffic displayed the 
highest 
correlations 
with 
examined 
geospatial 
metrics, followed by PM0.2 traffic which correlated 
weakly with intersections suggesting it could be cap­
turing tailpipe emissions from acceleration in stop- 
and-go traffic. However, a significant relationship 
between 
non-fwy/hwy 
NOx 
and 
intersections 
(250 m) on PM0.2 traffic was revealed once LB 
excluded (Supplement Figure S5.B). This smaller 
spatial scale of influence was masked using standard 
linear correlations. Similarly, for PM2.5 diesel traffic, 
bivariate GAMs revealed a joint effect of fwy/hwy 
NOx with truck percent, and fwy/hwy NOx with 
intersections (250 m) at a smaller spatial scale. This 
is consistent with (Karner, Eisinger, and Niemeier 
2010) findings showing EC (marker of PM2.5 diesel 
traffic) decays from the edge of the road to back­
ground within very short spatial scales (~130 m).
Non-tailpipe traffic sources
To our knowledge, this is one of very few studies 
finding non-negligible contributions of AVE across 
the entire quasi-ultrafine to coarse PM size distribu­
tion (minimum of ~8% in PM0.2 and up to 18% in 
PM2.5–10 on average), with important differences 
across communities. In Long Beach, the average pre­
dicted contribution of AVE reached up to 30%, 45% 
and 59% of PM0.2, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 mass,

respectively, likely due to its concentrated heavy-duty 
vehicle (truck) activity. Earlier work has mainly 
focused on AVE signals in PM10 or PM2.5, with 
much fewer studies reporting brake, tire and catalyst 
wear signals in PM0.2 or smaller. Kuwayama, Ruehl, 
and Kleeman (2013) found brake wear and road dust 
source in PM0.1 marked by Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb in 
Sacramento, CA. Hays et al. (2011) found elevated 
catalyst (Pt, Rh, Pd) in the 1–2 µm aerodynamic 
diameter range and brake and tire wear (Cu and Sb) 
markers in the ≥1–4 µm range in a near-highway 
study with predominantly light-duty gasoline vehicles. 
Several studies have documented the presence of pla­
tinum group metals from catalyst attrition in airborne 
and settled traffic-related PM and road dust (Ely et al. 
2001; Wiseman and Zereini 2009; Zereini, Alsenz, and 
Wiseman et al. 2012; Zereini, Wiseman, and Püttmann 
2007). Laboratory dynamometer testing of a variety of 
modern brake materials showed that the PM10 mass 
from brake wear consisted of 27%, 35% and 38% 
coarse (PM10–2.5), fine (PM2.5–0.1) and ultrafine parti­
cles, respectively (Garg et al. 2000). Increasingly, stu­
dies are showing non-negligible contributions of 
ultrafine brake wear particles to total PM10 (Nosko 
and Olofsson 2017; Thorpe and Harrison 2008), with 
higher temperature increasing emissions in the ultra­
fine range (Grigoratos and Martini 2015; Shin et al. 
2019). These findings underscore potentially important 
implications for near-roadway exposures as tailpipe 
emissions decrease because of clean technologies 
while non-tailpipe emissions increase in relative 
importance, especially in the smallest PM0.2 size 
fraction.
In terms of potential geospatial predictors, AVE in 
PM0.2 and PM2.5–10 were most correlated with fwy/hwy 
NOx, while AVE in PM2.5 was most correlated with 
truck percent. Non-fwy/hwy NOx was also highly corre­
lated with AVE in PM2.5–10 and to a lesser extent AVE in 
PM2.5. However, in bivariate GAMs, truck percent was 
significantly related to AVE in all size fractions as NOx 
increased. These relationships were heavily driven by 
Long Beach data. This suggests that the impact of light- 
duty vehicles on AVE was masked when LB data were 
included with its predominantly heavy-duty vehicle 
impact. Similarly, the impact of smaller roads with light- 
duty vehicles (non-fwy/hwy NOx) and stop-and-go traf­
fic (intersections (500 m)) on AVE in PM0.2 was revealed 
once LB was excluded.
Overall, LB was much more influential in non- 
tailpipe traffic analyses compared to tailpipe, and 
CALINE4 line source dispersion estimates, trucks on 
nearest freeways and intersections strongly influenced 
predicted AVE levels in interrelated ways, and within 
small spatial scales. These results are in line with recent 
work in Boston that found strong spatial gradients away 
from major roadways for markers of AVE (e.g., Ba, Zn, 
Cu, Fe) in PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 size fractions (Koutrakis 
et al. 2018). Oakes et al. (2016) also showed brake wear 
metals Ba and Cu were most enriched in PM2.5 and 
PM10 within 100 m of a major interstate in Detroit, 
Michigan.
Trends in traffic emissions as a result of mobile 
source regulations
Our results show important contributions of AVE to 
traffic emissions in all three size fractions, and especially 
in areas with significant heavy-duty truck activity and 
ports. Our data were collected in 2008–9 as part of the 
CHS with the goal of modeling traffic-related PM expo­
sures of participants and retrospectively assessing their 
impacts on health. However, since 2009, several federal 
and state mobile source control regulations have come 
into play in southern California for both on-road and 
off-road vehicles, engines and equipment (Lurmann, 
Avol, and Gilliland 2015).
Among those affecting tailpipe emissions, the 
California Air Resources Board (CARB) Truck and Bus 
Rule requires all heavy-duty diesel vehicles to reduce 
engine emissions of PM, NOx and air toxics (Board 
2018). The federal U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s (EPA) Tier 3 Motor Vehicle Emission and 
Fuel Standards program required reductions in tailpipe 
and evaporative emissions from most light- and med­
ium-duty and some heavy-duty vehicles and lowered the 
sulfur content of gasoline fuel starting in 2017 (Agency 
2014). Overall, these regulations have led to reductions 
in on-road, tailpipe PM emissions from light, medium 
and heavy-duty vehicles over time. For example, Bishop 
(2019) measured on-road tailpipe emissions in 
Lynwood, CA in 1989, 1999 and 2018 and reported 
reductions of up to a factor of 20 for carbon monoxide 
and up to a factor of 25 for hydrocarbons in tailpipe 
emissions in 2018 compared to the early 1990s.
As for non-tailpipe emissions, some of the major 
regulations include the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety 
Standard (FMVSS 121) which required a reduction in 
stopping distance for heavy-duty trucks starting in 2011 
(Caltrans Division or Research Innovation and System 
Information DoEA 2017). As a result, new materials 
with better stopping power such as semi-metallic brake 
linings are increasingly being used, and these release 
more airborne PM than traditional ceramic or metallic 
brakes (Caltrans Division or Research Innovation and 
System Information DoEA 2017). California legislation 
SB 346 also regulated hazardous material content in 
224
R. HABRE ET AL.
brake pads starting in 2014, with the goal of reducing 
copper weight content to 5% by 2021 and 0.5% by 2025. 
This is expected to influence the chemical composition 
and potentially size distribution (PM10 to PM2.5 ratios) 
of brake wear PM emissions (Caltrans Division or 
Research Innovation and System Information DoEA 
2017). Finally, regenerative braking systems in electric 
and hybrid light- and heavy-duty vehicles are expected 
to significantly lower brake wear emissions especially at 
low speeds (<30 mph) (Caltrans Division or Research 
Innovation and System Information DoEA 2017).
In terms of tire wear emissions, with the push for 
more fuel economy (for example, Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards), lower rolling resis­
tance tires are increasingly used, and these are thought 
to have higher tire wear emission rates (Caltrans 
Division 
or 
Research 
Innovation 
and 
System 
Information DoEA 2017). Other trends include 
increased use of larger brake pads and larger tire sizes 
with potentially unclear implications. Taken together, it 
is difficult to quantify the net impact of these regulations 
and trends on overall non-tailpipe AVE emissions. 
However, tailpipe emission reductions are likely result­
ing in a higher relative contribution of non-tailpipe 
sources to total traffic-related PM emissions over time 
(Thorpe and Harrison 2008).
Implications for exposure modeling and health 
analyses
Our work demonstrates the challenges involved in iso­
lating and modeling the independent impacts of tailpipe 
and non-tailpipe traffic on observed PM concentrations. 
It also illustrates the extent to which mixture modeling 
approaches (e.g., bivariate GAMs) can uncover more 
complex and non-linear relationships among geospatial 
metrics in terms of how they might jointly influence 
concentrations of traffic-related PM.
Despite our robust PMF modeling results, collinea­
rities in source profiles (e.g., similar physiochemical 
fingerprints) or contributions (e.g., similar source 
areas, or emissions, dispersion and removal patterns) 
(Habre, Coull, and Koutrakis 2011; Tian et al. 2014) 
can still complicate source apportionment. For example, 
like in other studies (Thorpe and Harrison 2008), we had 
difficulty discerning AVE from resuspended road dust in 
the PM2.5–10. We also had difficulty disentangling fuel oil 
burning (marked by Ni and V) from the non-tailpipe 
AVE factor in PM2.5, likely due to their highly collinear 
source contributions as a result of overlapping port 
source areas in LB.
In addition, even when sources are properly sepa­
rated and quantified, their source contributions can 
still exhibit moderate to high degrees of correlation 
reflecting true variation. Examples include AVE and 
diesel traffic in PM2.5 (r = 0.4), sea salt in PM2.5 and 
fuel oil in PM0.2 (r = 0.68), and AVE sources across all 
size fractions (r > 0.8) (Supplement Table S7). In parti­
cular, AVE in PM0.2 and PM2.5 are slightly more corre­
lated (0.9) than with AVE in PM2.5–10 (~0.8). This could 
be due to the combined road dust signal in PM2.5–10 and 
the quicker settling rate and sharper spatial gradients for 
larger particles. Thorpe and Harrison (2008) similarly 
report difficulties in isolating contributions of AVE. 
These correlations have important implications for 
future spatiotemporal modeling efforts attempting to 
predict non-tailpipe AVE population exposures in dif­
ferent size fractions.
Furthermore, these correlations should be carefully 
considered when adjusting for potential confounders in 
health analyses, given humans are exposed to air pollu­
tion mixtures and not single pollutants or sources in 
isolation. Several alternate source apportionment mod­
eling approaches allow analysts to impose orthogonal 
rotations on the factor solution in order to derive statis­
tically independent sources. However, imposing strict 
orthogonality conditions – while desirable for statistical 
modeling – may fail to fully capture real-life physical 
variation in these sources and ultimately in exposures.
Finally, we noted the strong influence of the ports of 
Los Angeles and Long Beach on our geospatial predictor 
screening efforts for most traffic-related PM sources. 
Other areas and cities around the world may also have 
similarly complex zones of concentrated heavy-duty 
vehicular and marine vessel activity which may mask 
the contributions of light-duty vehicles, smaller roads 
and intersections. These characteristics along with 
microclimatic processes, heavy industrial activity and 
other major urban sources can create challenges for 
spatiotemporal exposure modeling. In our own NOx 
machine-learning-based spatiotemporal model (Li, 
Girguis, and Lurmann et al. 2019), we demonstrated 
greater shared multiplicative exposure measurement 
error for the community of Long Beach compared to 
the rest of southern CA (Girguis et al. 2020, 2019). This 
error was partially explained by heavy-duty vehicle 
activity on the nearest freeway, major airports and vehi­
cular activity on smaller roads (Girguis et al. 2019). Our 
earlier models included CALINE4 line source dispersion 
NOx estimates, which was also one of the top geospatial 
metrics for capturing both diesel tailpipe and non- 
tailpipe traffic contributions in this analysis. This is 
expected given CALINE4 NOx estimates from tailpipe 
emissions strongly reflect local vehicle miles traveled, 
which is a surrogate for tire wear, resuspended road 
dust, and, to a lesser extent, brake wear.

Limitations and strengths
We note several limitations to our analysis, including the 
smaller sample size in the fine and coarse PM size frac­
tions compared to quasi-ultrafine and limited temporal 
variability at the residential locations (month-long sam­
ples in cool and warm seasons), but supplemental mon­
itoring at central sites ensured more complete temporal 
coverage. In addition, our results are influenced by the 
representativeness of our sampling data across commu­
nities, seasons and in time, since the data were collected in 
2008–9. Estimated source contributions and their relative 
importance might not fully represent average impacts 
across the entire modeling region of southern California 
at the time of sampling, and they do not reflect the 
impacts of regulations that entered into force after 2009 
as explained earlier. However, the sampling strategy 
ensured adequate representation of low and high traffic 
communities from within southern California.
As noted in Fruin et al. (2014) we expect our sam­
pling data to suffer from some degree of volatile losses 
especially for organic carbon in the warm season. 
Nitrate backup filters were consistently used but 
backup quartz filters were not. As reported in the 
2010 CalNex studies (Hayes, Ortega, and Cubison 
et al. 2013), the organic fraction of PM2.5 mass is 
expected to be much larger and closer to 50%. These 
sampling artifacts likely limited our ability to detect 
secondary organic aerosol sources and contributed to 
the difficulty in fully reconstructing PM0.2 mass (since 
PMF was only able to explain ~63% of its variability). 
In addition, there is some degree of subjective decision- 
making involved in PMF modeling, as is common with 
all source apportionment models, in terms of requiring 
the analyst to set criteria, make decisions, label factors 
or interpret solutions in light of apriori knowledge and 
scientific literature.
Strengths of our analysis include low detection limits 
of the analytical methods and measurements in three size 
fractions capturing enhanced neighborhood to commu­
nity scale spatial variability. In addition, we were able to 
identify and resolve abrasive vehicular emissions in all 
size fractions and distinguish gasoline from diesel tailpipe 
traffic signals in PM2.5. Finally, our extensive suite of 
geospatial metrics and non-linear modeling approaches 
enabled us to detect joint effects of these metrics on 
predicted traffic-related PM at small spatial scales.

Effective density of inhaled environmental 
and engineered nanoparticles and its impact 
on the lung deposition and dosimetry
Denisa Lizonova1, Amogh Nagarkar2, Philip Demokritou1 and Georgios A. Kelesidis1,2* 
Abstract 
Background  Airborne environmental and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are inhaled and deposited in the res-
piratory system. The inhaled dose of such NPs and their deposition location in the lung determines their impact 
on health. When calculating NP deposition using particle inhalation models, a common approach is to use the bulk 
material density, ρb, rather than the effective density, ρeff. This neglects though the porous agglomerate structure 
of NPs and may result in a significant error of their lung-deposited dose and location.
Results  Here, the deposition of various environmental NPs (aircraft and diesel black carbon, wood smoke) and engi-
neered NPs (silica, zirconia) in the respiratory system of humans and mice is calculated using the Multiple-Path Particle 
Dosimetry model accounting for their realistic structure and effective density. This is done by measuring the NP 
ρeff which was found to be up to one order of magnitude smaller than ρb. Accounting for the realistic ρeff of NPs 
reduces their deposited mass in the pulmonary region of the respiratory system up to a factor of two in both human 
and mouse models. Neglecting the ρeff of NPs does not alter significantly the distribution of the deposited mass frac-
tions in the human or mouse respiratory tract that are obtained by normalizing the mass deposited at the head, tra-
cheobronchial and pulmonary regions by the total deposited mass. Finally, the total deposited mass fraction derived 
this way is in excellent agreement with those measured in human studies for diesel black carbon.
Conclusions  The doses of inhaled NPs are overestimated by inhalation particle deposition models when the ρb 
is used instead of the real-world effective density which can vary significantly due to the porous agglomerate struc-
ture of NPs. So the use of realistic ρeff, which can be measured as described here, is essential to determine the lung 
deposition and dosimetry of inhaled NPs and their impact on public health.

Background
Over the  past century, the  exposure of  humans to air-
borne environmental and engineered nanoparticles (NPs) 
has increased dramatically due to air pollution, techno-
logical advancements and use in nano-enabled products 
across the value chain and various industries [1–6]. Such 
nanoscale particles share unique physicochemical prop-
erties that stem from their small size and large surface 
area, chemistry and reactivity  and render them rather 
toxic to human health [7].
In particular, environmental and engineered NPs have 
been linked with a variety of pulmonary [8–11], cardio-
vascular [12–15] and other effects [16–19], even though 
the  underlying mechanisms are still not well under-
stood. It is worth noting that given the continuous rise 
of air pollution due to climate change [20, 21], as well as 
the emerging markets for engineered nanomaterials [22], 
it is essential to get a better understanding of the impact 
of these NPs on public health.
Most of the (primary) airborne environmental pollut-
ants, such as black carbon (BC) or wood smoke, are emit-
ted from combustion sources, including engines, coal or 
biomass combustors and wildfires [23–25]. In addition 
to environmental pollutants, combustion contributes 
decisively to the formation of nanostructured commodi-
ties, including carbon black, silica  and titania  that are 
produced in flame reactors [22]. The environmental and 
engineered NPs formed during these processes coagulate 
into porous, fractal-like clusters (i.e. agglomerates) [26, 
27]. The  size of  these agglomerates is commonly quan-
tified by their mobility and aerodynamic diameters [28] 
that vary significantly between materials and combus-
tion sources and processes, as summarized in Table  1. 
The agglomerate porosity is determined by the effective 
density, ρeff, that is defined here as the ratio of the particle 
mass and equivalent mobility volume and is just a frac-
tion of the material bulk density, ρb [28, 29]. The small 
agglomerate ρeff affects the gravitational settling, inertial 
impaction and diffusion of NPs [30] and thus affects their 
lung deposition and dosimetry.
In nanotoxicology research, both in vivo animal stud-
ies as well as in vitro cellular approaches are employed to 
assess potential toxicological endpoints [31, 32]. Particle 
lung deposition models such as the Multiple-Path Parti-
cle Dosimetry (MPPD) [33, 34] and International Com-
mission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) [35] models, 
are often used to determine the lung deposited dose using 
the airborne exposure levels of inhaled NPs. For example, 
MPPD has been recently used by the authors and others 
to derive the  inhaled dose of  ambient particulate mat-
ter [36–38], BC [39, 40], wood smoke [41], titania [42], 
ceria [31, 43], micro- and nanoplastics [44], nano-ena-
bled products [45], printer emitted particles [46, 47] and 
e-cigarette [48] emissions using ρb rather than ρeff. From 
the  calculated in  vivo lung-deposited dose, the in  vitro 
administered dose can also be back-calculated using 
in vitro particle-kinetic dosimetry models, as described 
in detail by the authors in previous publications [3, 31, 
45, 49, 50]. It should be noted that the effective density 
for in vitro particle dosimetry is defined as the density of

For simplicity, MPPD is commonly employed using ρb 
which can differ significantly from the  ρeff. [31, 38, 39]. 
This oversimplification may limit though the  accuracy 
of  MPPD calculations for various environmental and 
engineered NPs that form agglomerates with small ρeff 
[26]. For example, the total deposited mass of ceria NPs 
measured in mice was overestimated by MPPD using 
the  ceria  ρb by up to a  factor of  two [43]. Similarly, 
the mass of diesel BC deposited in the human respiratory 
system obtained using ρb (1 g/cm3) was a factor of two 
larger than that derived using the measured ρeff [51].
In this regard, the development and commercialization 
of  aerosol particle mass (APM) analyzers have enabled 
the accurate measurement of the NP ρeff [52–55]. During 
APM measurements, NPs pass through an electric field 
between two rotating cylindrical electrodes. By adjust-
ing the electric field potential and the rotating electrode 
angular velocity, the particle mass [52], volume fraction 
[56] and consequently ρeff [57] can be measured. It should 
be noted that APM is well suited for characterization of 
NP agglomerates, but its accuracy is not well established 
for elongated particles (e.g. fibers or tubes). For example, 
the alignment of such particles in an external electric 
field [58] can result in measurement errors up to 7% [59]. 
In addition to the APM analyzers, ρeff can be also meas-
ured using electrical low pressure [60] or hypersonic 
impactors [61] and time-of-flight mass spectrometers 
[62]. The agglomerate ρeff can be obtained also in vivo by 
fitting the MPPD simulations to the measured lung bur-
den [63].
So, APM analyzers have been used to obtain the  ρeff 
of  environmental NPs, including wood smoke [64], BC 
emissions from diesel [57, 65], gasoline [66, 67] and 
marine [68] engines, as well as that of engineered nano-
materials (e.g. carbon black [69], silica [70], zirconia 
[71]). The ρeff measured that way has facilitated the deri-
vation and validation of advanced computational models 
[72] for the  particle morphology [26], light absorption 
[73, 74], scattering [75, 76] and even climate impact [77].
Here, APM is used to demonstrate how to measure 
the ρeff of model environmental NPs, namely, aircraft-like 
BC from enclosed jet fuel combustion [78]. The aircraft 
BC ρeff obtained here, as well as those of other model 
NPs obtained from the literature for diesel BC [65], wood 
smoke [64], silica [70] and zirconia [71] (summarized in 
Table 1) are used in MPPD to determine the error from 
dose calculations derived using the commonly used pris-
tine material bulk density. The deposited mass distribu-
tions derived using ρeff are validated with experimental 
data  of  human  exposure diesel BC emissions [65] and 
compared to those obtained commonly in the literature 
using ρb.
Results and discussion
Effective density of environmental and engineered NPs
Figure 1 shows the ρeff measured for various model NPs 
such as aircraft (squares, this work) or diesel BC (cir-
cles [65]), wood smoke (diamonds [64]), silica (triangles 
[70]) and zirconia  (inverse triangles [71]) as a  function 
of  their  mobility diameter, dm. The  raw ρeff data pre-
sented in Fig.  1 have been obtained for NP agglom-
erates with distinct dm. The  NP ρeff decreases up to 
a  factor of  about four with increasing dm due to their

fractal-like, agglomerate morphology, which is consist-
ent with theoretical [26] and empirical [79] power laws 
derived for agglomerates. The ρeff of zirconia NPs is up 
to factor of  two larger than  those of  BC, wood smoke 
and silica due to their larger ρb (see Table 1). Similarly, 
the ρeff measured here for aircraft BC is up to a factor of 
1.4 smaller than that of diesel BC and wood smoke NP 
agglomerates having the  same dm. The  bulk density, ρb, 
is practically the same for aircraft, diesel BC and wood 
smoke primary particles (Table 1). So, this ρeff difference 
can be attributed to the diameter of about 28 nm of die-
sel BC [65] and wood smoke [64] primary particles that 
is 50% larger than the diameter of aircraft BC primary 
particles (12 nm [78]). This is consistent with theoretical 
power laws showing that ρeff increases with the primary 
particle diameter [26]. It is worth noting that the ρeff pre-
sented here for environmental and engineered NPs is up 
to an order of magnitude smaller than the respective ρb.
Using the  measured ρeff along with the  entire mobil-
ity size distribution, one can obtain the overall NP mass 
median mobility diameter (MMMD), as well as the mass 
median  aerodynamic diameter (MMAD; see Methods). 
The latter is essential for the estimation of the NP lung 
deposition and dose. Even though zirconia NPs have 
larger ρeff compared to silica (Fig.  1), their dm obtained 
from the  entire size distribution is about 30% smaller. 
This explains the MMMD of silica NPs that is 27% larger 
than that of zirconia ones. Table 1 summarizes the count 
median  diameter (CMD), MMMD, MMAD, ρb and ρeff 
of agglomerates having MMAD and MMMD for all NPs 
used in this study. For example, diesel BC agglomerates 
with MMAD = 152.8  nm and MMMD = 349.5  nm have 
ρeff = 0.28  g/cm3, which is within the ρeff = 0.96–0.26  g/
cm3 measured for agglomerates with dm = 50–368  nm 
(Fig. 1: circles [65]).
Lung deposition calculations and validation of MPPD 
dosimetric calculations with human experimental 
data using ρeff
Lung deposition of  inhaled NPs was simulated using 
MPPD with realistic ρeff (Fig.  2) and validated with 
measurements for the case of diesel BC [65]. The depos-
ited mass fractions derived here by MPPD accounting 
for the  realistic ρeff of  diesel BC are in excellent agree-
ment with the  measured ones, validating the  MPPD 
simulations presented in this work. In particular, Fig. 2 
compares the  mass fraction of  deposited diesel BC as 
a  function of  its dm derived by MPPD using ρeff (line) 
to those measured from 9 human  subjects exposed to 
the exhaust of a real diesel engine (symbols [65]). These 
data  were obtained using the  dm distributions meas-
ured in the  inhaled and exhaled air. The  ρeff used in 
MPPD is varied with dm using Eq. 2 (see Methods) with 
mass-mobility exponent and prefactor derived by fitting 
Eq. 2 to the ρeff measured for diesel BC (see Additional 
file 1: Table S1). At this size range, the deposition of die-
sel BC particles by diffusion, inertial impaction and gravi-
tational settling decreases with increasing dm [80, 81], 
reducing the total deposited mass fraction.
Impact of ρb and ρeff on lung deposition dose calculations
The  deposited mass of  environmental and engineered 
NPs in the respiratory tract of humans (Fig. 3) and mice 
(Fig.  4) was calculated using the  MPPD model with 
the measured ρeff (filled bars) or ρb (open bars) under the 
same input parameters. It is worth noting that MPPD, 
like any other model, has its own limitations and more 
studies are needed to validate the model for the various 
conditions and animal models. In humans (Fig. 3), using 
ρb rather than ρeff results in an overestimation of the total 
deposited mass by a factor of about two for all environ-
mental and engineered NPs investigated here. Neglect-
ing the realistic agglomerate ρeff affects also the regional 
distribution of the  deposited mass. For example, using 
ρb in MPPD overestimates the deposited mass of aircraft 
BC in the head human airways by just 17.1%. However, 
the  deposited aircraft BC mass in the  tracheobronchial 
and pulmonary regions is overestimated using ρb by 74.4 
and 80.2%, respectively. 
The overestimation of the deposited mass of NPs can 
be attributed to the  enhancement of  the  particle iner-
tial impaction in the  TB and pulmonary regions when 
large ρb is used instead of the realistic ρeff [30]. It should 
be noted that gravitational settling hardly contributes to 
the density effects observed here (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S1). So, the  ρb is commonly assumed in literature esti-
mations of  inhaled NP deposition and dosimetry when 
Fig. 2  Mass fraction of deposited diesel BC NPs measured (symbols 
[65]) or estimated by MPPD (line) as a function of dm

the realistic ρeff is either not known, or for the purpose 
of simplifying the calculations [38, 39, 43]. This can how-
ever lead to significant error in the NP deposition calcu-
lation, as is shown here.
Figure  3 shows that most of the  particles are depos-
ited in the  tracheobronchial (TB) and pulmonary (P) 
regions of the human respiratory system, where the dep-
osition is governed by diffusion, inertial impaction and

gravitational settling [80–82]. Therefore, the  largest 
deposited mass was obtained for zirconia NPs. These 
NPs are described by small MMAD compared to those 
of diesel BC and wood smoke which enhances their dep-
osition by diffusion [80, 82]. Moreover, zirconia NPs are 
described by high ρb and ρeff compared to those of air-
craft BC and silica, which further enhance their inertial 
impaction [30]. In the head airways of the human respira-
tory system, only few particles are deposited in all cases, 
where this is done by an impaction mechanism [80, 81, 
83].
The impact of ρeff on the estimation of the NP depos-
ited dose is similar for both human and mouse models, as 
shown in Fig. 4. So, neglecting the realistic ρeff and calcu-
lating with ρb instead results in an overestimation of the 
total NP deposited mass in mouse lungs by up to a factor 
of about two. The largest mass deposited in the TB and 
pulmonary regions is obtained here for zirconia, consist-
ent with the masses derived for zirconia NPs inhaled by 
humans (Fig. 3).
In summary, Table 2 shows the total mass of deposited 
NPs in the human and mouse respiratory tracts derived 
by MPPD using ρb or ρeff. The overestimation of the total 
deposited mass by a  factor of  1.5–2 obtained here 
using MPPD with ρb is consistent with those reported 
in literature for engineered [43] and environmental 
[51] NPs. Clearly, the  dose of  inhaled engineered and 
environmental NPs can be overestimated substantially by 
MPPD using ρb, limiting the assessment of their impact 
on pulmonary [8, 9] and cardiovascular diseases [12–15].
Furthermore, Fig.  5 shows the  distribution across 
the  respiratory system of  the  deposited mass fraction 
of inhaled aircraft BC NPs by humans (a) and mice (b) 
derived here by MPPD using ρb (open bars) or ρeff (filled 
bars). The  deposited mass fraction is obtained by nor-
malizing the  mass deposited in the  head, TB or pul-
monary region of  the  tract with respect to the  total 
deposited mass. Accounting for the  realistic ρeff of  air-
craft BC reduces its inertial impaction in all regions 
of  the  human  or mouse respiratory tract and does not 
alter significantly the distribution of the deposited mass 
fractions. The  distributions of  the  deposited mass frac-
tions derived here for diesel BC, wood smoke, silica and 
zirconia are similar to those obtained for aircraft BC and 
presented in Additional file 1: Fig. S2.
Conclusions
In sum, the  error in NP lung deposition dose calcula-
tions which is derived using the ρb rather than the actual 
ρeff of NPs was assessed here using a variety of model 
environmental and engineered NPs. As shown, the  ρeff 
measured here for aircraft black carbon (BC) NPs using 
an APM is one order of magnitude smaller than ρb and 
follows closely those measured in literature for diesel BC

[65], wood smoke [64], silica [70] and zirconia [71]. It was 
shown that the MPPD-derived mass fraction of diesel BC 
NPs deposited in the human lungs is in excellent agree-
ment with experimental data [65], validating the impor-
tance of using the realistic ρeff rather than the commonly 
used ρb.
More importantly, it was shown that using ρb and 
neglecting the  realistic porous structure of  environ-
mental and engineered NPs results in an  overestima-
tion of  their deposited mass by a  factor of  about two. 
This can be attributed to the NP inertial impaction that 
is overestimated by MPPD using ρb instead of ρeff. This 
may explain similar discrepancies reported in litera-
ture for ceria [43] and diesel BC [51] NPs and highlights 
the role of ρeff in the modeling of lung deposition of NPs. 
So, the use of realistic ρeff in lung deposition models is 
essential to determine the dose of inhaled NPs, enabling 
the accurate assessment of their impact on human health.
Methods
Synthesis of aircraft‑like BC NPs and measurement of their 
size and effective density
Aircraft-like BC NPs were generated here by enclosed 
spray combustion of jet A fuel at an effective equivalence 
ratio of 1.77 [78]. The morphology, composition, nano-
structure and primary particle size distribution of the BC 
NPs emitted by the present reactor (Additional file 1: Fig. 
S3) are in excellent agreement with those measured from 
real aircraft engines [84, 85]. So, the aircraft-like BC pro-
duced here was sampled using a straight tube and rapidly 
diluted by a factor of about 65 [71]. The diluted aerosol 
was directed to a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) 
made of  a  differential mobility analyzer (Model 3081, 
TSI Inc.) coupled with a  condensation particle coun-
ter (Model 3775, TSI Inc.) [71]. The CMD and MMMD 
of  the  dm distribution obtained by SMPS are given in 
Table  1. The  mass, m, of  the  sampled aerosol was also 
measured by interfacing an aerosol particle mass (APM, 
Model APM-3600, Kanomax) analyzer with the  SMPS 
[86]. That way, the ρeff can be derived from first principles 
[28]:
The NP agglomerate ρeff measured this way decreases 
with dm based on a power law [87]:
where k and Dfm are the  mass-mobility prefactor and 
exponent, respectively. The NP agglomerate k and Dfm

were derived by fitting Eq. 2 to the data shown in Fig. 1 
(Additional file 1: Table S1). So, ρeff can be estimated for 
any dm using Eq. 2 and the fitted k and Dfm. MMAD was 
derived based on the measured MMMD and ρeff [87, 88]:
where ρo = 1  g/cm3 is the  unitary density and CC is 
the Cunningham slip correction factor [80]:
where d = MMMD or MMAD and λ = 66 nm is the gas 
mean free path at room temperature [80]. The MMAD 
was obtained for aircraft BC NPs generated here, as well 
as for the diesel BC [65], wood smoke [64], silica [70] and 
zirconia [71] NPs using ρeff and dm distribution data avail-
able in the literature (Table 1).
Simulation of NP deposition in the respiratory system 
using MPPD model
The  MPPD model (V3.04) was used here to simulate 
the  deposition of  inhaled engineered and environmen-
tal NPs in the lung airway from the head to the alveolar 
region [33, 34, 89, 90]. MPPD  calculations for humans 
were done using the  Yeh/Schum symmetric model [91] 
with a functional residual capacity of 3300 mL and head 
volume of  50  mL [92]. The  nasal respiratory rate (RR) 
was set to 12 breaths/minute, the tidal volume (TV) to 
625 mL and the inspiratory fraction to 0.5 [92]. MPPD 
calculations were also done for mice using the  mouse 
BALB/c model [33] with body weight of 30 g [93]. The RR 
of 224 breaths/min and TV of 0.22 mL derived for mice 
using the  allometric scaling equations of Guyton et  al. 
[94] and Piccione et al. [95], respectively, were used for 
input into MPPD. The functional residual capacity (FRC) 
of 0.3 mL was used to be consistent with the measured 
range of 0.20–0.43 mL [96]. The upper respiratory tract 
(URT) volume of 0.0322  mL used here is the  default 
MPPD value, which is based on experimental measure-
ments [93] and is commonly utilized in MPPD simula-
tions [97, 98]. Both humans and mice were assumed to 
be exposed to a particle concentration of 0.01 mg/m3 at 
“upright” and “on stomach” body orientations, respec-
tively. The latter is consistent with in vivo conscious ani-
mal studies [99]. The mass concentration of 0.01 mg/m3 is 
the proposed ­PM2.5 limit by United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) [100]. It should be noted that 
­PM2.5 contains larger particles than those investigated 
here that are largely contained in the ­PM0.1 aerodynamic

size fraction. In this regard, the  mass concentration of 
­PM0.1 emissions from the  combustion sources investi-
gated here are often much larger than the  EPA ­PM2.5 
limit used here. For example, mass concentrations of 
3.3–26, 0.6–0.8 and 0.004–0.5  mg/m3 have been meas-
ured from pinewood [24], diesel [101], and jet fuel [102] 
combustion, respectively. The  MPPD parameters are 
summarized in Additional file  1: Table  S2. The  inhaled 
NPs were assumed to be monodisperse having the meas-
ured MMAD and ρeff (Table 1) or the constant bulk den-
sities, ρb = 1.8, 1.7, 2.2 and 5.7 g/cm3 for BC, wood smoke, 
silica and zirconia, respectively. The wood smoke ρb is 
obtained based on the measured organic carbon con-
tent and empirical ρb relations [74]. The deposited mass 
is calculated from the MPPD-derived regional deposited 
mass rate per minute (µg/min) by integrating over 40 h 
of exposure (equivalent to 8 h per day, 5 days per week), 
as previously described by Bitounis et al. [10]. It is worth 
noting that MPPD, despite its wide use in the nanotoxi-
cology domain, has its own limitations (like any other 
available inhalation dosimetry model) and further valida-
tion studies related to its proposed conditions and animal 
models will be useful in advancing the dosimetry field.
The impact of the ρeff variation with dm on the MPPD 
calculations was also investigated here. To this end, 
the lung deposition of aircraft BC was simulated assum-
ing monodisperse particles with MMAD, as well as 
accounting for their polydispersity by discretizing their 
dm distribution into 10 bins (Additional file 1: Table S3) 
using Eq. 2 with k, Dfm derived by fitting Eq. 2 to the ρeff 
measured for aircraft BC (Additional file  1: Table  S1). 
Accounting for the  geometric standard deviation of 
the mobility size distribution, as well as for the ρeff vari-
ation with dm decreased the total deposited mass just by 
6% (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). Therefore, the lung depo-
sition of inhaled NPs can be estimated rather accurately 
neglecting their polydispersity.

Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health
challenge globally. The burden of COPD is high in never-smokers but little is known about
its causes. We aimed to ﬁnd the prevalence and correlates of COPD in never-smokers,
with a special focus on solid fuel exposure.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Western China. COPD was deﬁned
by FEV1/FVC < lower limits of normal (LLN). Descriptive statistics and multivariable
logistic regression were used for analyses.
Results: Six thousand two hundred and seventy one patients were enrolled between
June 2015 and August 2016. The prevalence of COPD in never-smokers was 15.0%
(95% conﬁdence interval 14.1–15.9). The common independent predictors of COPD in
never-smokers included age ≥60 years, exposure to solid fuel, living in a rural area and a
history of tuberculosis. Participants with solid fuel exposure were 69% more likely to have
COPD (adjusted odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.41–2.04) than those without such exposure.
In addition, we found a positive association between small airway dysfunction and solid
fuel exposure (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.18–1.53).
Conclusions:
This study conﬁrmed the substantial burden of COPD among never-
smokers and also deﬁned the risk factors for COPD in never-smokers. Furthermore,
we found a positive association between solid fuel exposure and COPD or small
airway dysfunction.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a public health challenge globally, with high
prevalence, morbidity and mortality (1, 2). Cigarette smoking is regarded as a major risk factor
for COPD (3–5), but never-smokers comprise a substantial proportion of patients suﬀering from
COPD (6). Indeed, it has been estimated that 25–45% of COPD patients are never-smokers (6, 7).
The burden of COPD in never-smokers is thus substantial in developed and developing countries
(7, 8).
Long et al.
Solid Fuel and COPD in Never-Smokers
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
about half of the global population depends on solid fuel for
domestic cooking or heating (9). Burning of solid fuel produces
large amounts of health-damaging chemicals (10, 11). Exposure
to solid fuel has been linked to a range of adverse health
outcomes including lung cancer, COPD and pneumonia in
adults, especially among women (12–14).
Numerous studies have been carried out to evaluate the
prevalence and risk factors of COPD, while fewer studies have
focused solely on never-smokers. In a recent nationwide cross-
sectional study in China, more than half of the COPD patients
were never-smokers (15). In Tibet Autonomous Region (Tibet)
and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), solid fuel
were generally used, with more than half of households relying
on solid fuel for cooking or heating (16). We aimed to assess
the prevalence and correlates of COPD among never-smokers in
Tibet and Xinjiang, with a particular focus on solid fuel exposure.
METHODS
Study Setting
We performed a cross-sectional study on the prevalence and
determinants of COPD among people living in Xinjiang and
Tibet, China. Xinjiang and Tibet are the largest and second largest
provincial-level autonomous regions in China, located along the
western border of China. The Institutional Review Board and
ethics committee of Beijing Hospital (2013BJYYEC-042C-01)
approved the protocol of this study.
Participants
Detailed methods of the study have been described previously
(17). Between June 2015 and August 2016, a multistage stratiﬁed
sampling procedure was conducted to select a representative
sample of subjects living in Xinjiang and Tibet. First, 13
districts or counties were selected in both urban (2 districts)
and rural areas (11 counties) using the probability proportional
to size method. Second, a simple random sampling method
was adopted; two streets or townships were selected from each
district or county, and three communities or village communities
were selected from each street or township. Third, we randomly
selected individuals aged 15 years or older from the selected
communities or villages. The proportion of samples from each
gender and age group was based on the 2010 census of Chinese
population. We chose only one participant from each household.
We included permanent residents (who had lived at their
current residence for 1 year or longer) aged ≥15 years for
this analysis. Exclusion criteria were as follows: pregnancy;
myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident experienced
during the previous 3 months; heart rate >120 beats/min or
blood pressure >180/120 mmHg; and being physically incapable

of undergoing a spirometry test, such as due to recently

about the study and study methods, and provided written
informed consent before data collection.
Operational Deﬁnition
Trained and certiﬁed technicians performed pulmonary function
tests for all participants. We performed daily calibration
with a 3 L syringe and also recorded ambient temperature,
humidity and altitude daily. Forced expiratory volumes were
measured using the MasterScreenTM Pneumo PC spirometer
(CareFusion, Yorba Linda, CA) before and 20 min after the
administration of 400 µg of salbutamol through a 500 ml
spacer. Each spirogram was centrally reviewed and scored based
on the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory

Solid Fuel and COPD in Never-Smokers
Society (ATS/ERS) acceptability and reproducibility criteria (18).
We deﬁned: (1) COPD as a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC
below the lower limit of normal (LLN) of the Global Lung
Function Initiative (GLI) 2012 multiethnic equations (19); and
(2) small airway dysfunction on the basis of at least two of the
following three indicators of lung function being <65% of the
predicted level: maximal mid-expiratory ﬂow (MMEF), forced
expiratory ﬂow (FEF) 50% and FEF 75% (20). We calculated
the ratios of observed to predicted FEV1 based on GLI 2012
multiethnic equations and used them to stage the degree of
obstruction (GOLD stage I, ≥80% predicted; GOLD stage II,
≥50–<80% predicted; GOLD stage III, ≥30–<50% predicted;
and GOLD stage IV, <30% predicted) (19). Moreover, we used
a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC < 0.70, according to 2021
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
guidelines (1), deﬁne COPD in a sensitivity analysis.
Never-smokers were deﬁned as a participant who has
never smoked, or who has smoked <100 cigarettes in his or

her lifetime (21). Passive smoking was deﬁned as inhalation
of smoke by never-smokers who lived with smokers. Solid
fuel was deﬁned based on whether the participant had
used an open ﬁre with charcoal, coal, coke, wood, crop
residues or dung as the primary means of cooking or
heating for more than 6 months in their lifetime. History
of tuberculosis was deﬁned as a positive answer to the
question “Has a doctor or other health care provider ever told
you that you had tuberculosis?” Peripheral oxygen saturation
was measured by pulse-oximetry (PHILIPS DB12) before
performing spirometry.
Participants were considered to have: (1) chronic cough if they
have a cough for most of the day for as much as 3 consecutive
months during a year; (2) chronic phlegm if they bring up phlegm
for most of the day for as much as 3 consecutive months during
a year; (3) recurrent wheezing if their chest (lungs) ever sounded
wheezy (whistling sound); (4) dyspnea in daily life if they were
troubled by shortness of breath when hurrying on level ground,

chronic cough, chronic phlegm, recurrent wheezing or dyspnea
in daily life.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics such as count and percentage for categorical
variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous
variables were determined separately for men and women.
We conducted independent Student’s t-test and χ2 test for
continuous and categorical variables, respectively. We performed
univariable logistic regression to determine the distribution of
the study subjects by the independent variable of interest and
to see crude association. Meanwhile, we used multivariable
logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, body mass index
(BMI), education, education, residence, history of tuberculosis,
exposure to solid fuel, exposure to passive smoking, and exposure
to dust or chemicals in the workplace with adjusted odds
ratio. In the sensitivity analyses, we applied a ﬁxed cut-oﬀto
determine COPD.
All statistical analyses were performed using R with ggplot2,
forestplot and ordinal packages (www.r-project.org). For all tests,
the p-value was set to <0.05 to determine signiﬁcance.
RESULTS
Population Characteristics
Between June 2015 and August 2016, a total of 12,991 individuals
were randomly selected and invited to participate in the survey, of
whom 6,271 never-smokers consented and completed the study
(Supplementary Figure 1).
The characteristics of the 6,271 participants are presented in
Table 1. The average age (SD) among the participants was 39.7
(15.6) years, and the mean BMI was 24.2 (4.1) Kg/m2, with 68.1%
of the subjects being women. Overall, 83.8% of participants were
lived in rural areas, 70.8% were exposed to solid fuel, 21.1% were
exposed to passive smoking, 3.9% had a history of tuberculosis.
Epidemiology of COPD
The overall prevalence of LLN-deﬁned COPD was 15.0% (95%
CI 14.1–15.9) in the never-smoking population aged 15 years or
older (Table 2). There was no diﬀerence in COPD prevalence (P
= 0.94) between men and women. The age-speciﬁc prevalence
of COPD rose signiﬁcantly with increasing age (P < 0.05 for
both men and women; Supplementary Figure 2). It reached
17.0% (95% CI 15.6–18.3) among those aged ≥40 years. COPD
prevalence was higher in rural residents (15.9%, 95% CI 14.9–
16.9) than in urban residents (10.5%, 8.7–12.5; P < 0.001;
Table 2). The prevalence of COPD was 15.7% (95% CI 14.4–17.1)
in primary school or less, 15.7% (95% CI 14.3–17.2) in middle
school or high school, and 11.2% (95% CI 9.3–13.3) in college and
higher. Participants with history of tuberculosis exposure had a
higher prevalence of COPD than those without it (20.7%, 95% CI
15.7–26.3) vs. 14.8%, 95% CI 13.9–15.7); P < 0.02; Table 2).
We also performed a sensitivity analysis using an age-
speciﬁc ﬁxed cut-oﬀto deﬁne COPD. The overall prevalence of
spirometry-deﬁned COPD was 10.6% (95% CI 9.9–11.4). Men
had a higher prevalence (11.8%, 95% CI 10.4–13.3) than women
(10.1%, 95% CI 9.2–11.0; P < 0.05). Supplementary Table 1
presents the severity of COPD by GOLD grades. Approximately
34.5% COPD patients self-reported typical symptoms, such as
frequent cough, sputum, recurrent wheezing, or dyspnea in daily
life (Supplementary Table 2).

Predictors of COPD
Figure 1 displays the adjusted OR and 95% CI from the
multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine the COPD-
associated risk factors. For never-smokers with COPD, the
common independent association was age ≥60 years, exposure
to solid fuel, living in a rural area and a history of tuberculosis.
Characteristics of Participants by Solid
Fuel Exposure
Participants with solid fuel exposure had a higher prevalence of
COPD than those without it (17.1% (95% CI 16.0–18.2) vs. 10.0%
(95% CI 8.7–11.5); P < 0.0001) (Table 2). The age-stratiﬁed
prevalence of COPD was signiﬁcantly higher in participants with
solid fuel exposure than in those without it, and the ﬁxed cut-oﬀ
used did not change this result (Figure 2).
Participants with solid fuel exposure tended to be older,
women, less educated and living in rural areas compared with
those without such exposure (Table 3). On average, participants
with solid fuel exposure had lower pre- and post-bronchodilator
FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC than those without such exposure.
Participants with solid fuel exposure had higher frequencies of
chronic cough, dyspnea in daily life and at least one symptom
when compared with those without such exposure (Figure 3).
Participants with solid fuel exposure were more likely to
have COPD than those without such exposure. The adjusted
OR and 95% CI for the association between solid fuel exposure
and COPD was stronger in women (adjusted OR 1.74, 95% CI
1.39–2.21) than in men (1.64, 1.21–2.24) (Table 4).
Participants with solid fuel exposure were more likely to have
chronic cough, dyspnea in daily life and at least one symptom
than those without such exposure (Table 4). Participants with
solid fuel exposure were 72% more likely to have at least one
symptom (cough, sputum, wheeze, dyspnea) than participants
without such exposure (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.47–2.01).
Solid Fuel and Small Airway Dysfunction
The prevalence of small airway dysfunction was higher in
participants with solid fuel exposure than in those without
such exposure (55.7% vs. 47.9%; P < 0.001) (Figure 4). The
sex-stratiﬁed prevalence of COPD was signiﬁcantly higher in
participants with solid fuel exposure than in those without it.
Participants with solid fuel exposure were also more likely to have
small airway dysfunction than those without such exposure (OR
1.35, 95% CI 1.18–1.53) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of COPD and its
risk factors among never-smokers in Xinjiang and Tibet, with a
special focus on solid fuel exposure. Both COPD prevalence and
solid fuel exposure were signiﬁcantly high among never-smokers.
The factors independently associated with COPD were age ≥60
years, exposure to solid fuel, living in a rural area and a history
of tuberculosis. In addition, we found a positive association
between solid fuel exposure and respiratory symptoms or small
airway dysfunction. Our results highlight the substantial burden
of COPD among never-smokers and conﬁrm the increasingly
acknowledged impact of solid fuel on respiratory health.
Based on BOLD and other large scale epidemiological studies,
it is estimated that the global prevalence of COPD is about
11.7%, which increased 68.9% between 1990 and 2010 (22).
Although smoking is the leading cause of COPD in the world,
an estimated 25–45% of patients with COPD have never smoked
(7). Never-smokers with COPD are an important population
that is increasing but remains understudied. The China Kadoorie
Biobank (CKB) study (8) showed that the prevalence of COPD
was 5.9% for women and 5.2% for men, but the prevalence
varies widely by region. The prevalence of COPD in our study
was 15.0% in western China, which is consistent with the CKB
study of COPD prevalence in Sichuan province, which is a
high COPD prevalence that they cannot explain” (8). Sichuan
province borders Tibet to the west, and they both belong to
western China. Our study provides further insight into the
prevalence of COPD in never-smokers populations in western
China. The prevalence of COPD in never-smokers was in line

with the BOLD study (18.2%) (23). Although this rate was higher
than in studies from developed countries, such as the OLIN study
(6.9%) and the CanCOLD study (6.4%), the rates of solid fuel use
and tuberculosis are considerably lower than previously reported
in developing countries (24, 25).
About 3 billion people worldwide use solid fuel for cooking
or heating (7). Despite the decrease in the percentage of people
using solid fuels, the absolute population exposed to solid fuel
is more than three times greater than those smoking daily (12).
Solid fuel causes an estimated 3.5–4 million deaths every year and
more than 90% of solid fuel-related deaths occur in developing
countries, mainly in Asia and Africa (11). International studies
showed that participants with solid fuel exposure were 41% more
likely to have COPD than those without such exposure (26).
In addition, a cohort study revealed that long-term exposure to
solid fuel for cooking was associated with about 10% excess risk
of hospitalization or death due to COPD (27). The relationship
between solid fuel exposure and COPD reported in our study
was positive and the association was stronger than the results of
previous analyses probably because our analysis was conducted
in never-smokers (26) and the proportion of subjects exposed
to solid fuel in our study was higher (70.8%) than that reported
in these previous surveys. Solid fuel use has the potential to
adversely aﬀect the entire population, but the eﬀects of solid fuel

may be more apparent in never-smokers, in whom exposure to
tobacco is not a competing risk factor (28).
The small airways are the major and earliest site of airﬂow
limitation. Pathological studies suggest that loss of small airways
prior to the development of abnormal spirometry or emphysema
in COPD patients (29, 30). Recently, a cross-sectional study
highlights that small airway disease is a pathological feature
in mild and moderate COPD. Previous studies suggested that
biomass smoke exposed patients demonstrated a distinct proﬁle
of small airways disease when compared to tobacco smoke
exposed patients (31, 32). Our study showed that the prevalence
of small airway dysfunction is higher in participants with solid
fuel exposure than in those without it. We also found that
participants with soldi fuel exposure had lower levels of pre- and
post-bronchodilator FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio, reﬂecting
worse lung function among never-smokers. Previous studies
found exposure-response relationships between solid fuel and
lung function (33, 34). Individuals exposed to solid fuel had a
higher prevalence of small airway dysfunction and lower lung
function, suggesting that chronic inﬂammation from solid fuel

exposure is associated with the development of chronic airway
disease. Although the pathogenic mechanisms behind the harm
caused by solid fuel are not yet fully understood, solid fuel
is considered to enhance lung inﬂammation, alter the innate
immune response and promote an oxidative stress state (35).
Our study emphasizes the importance of solid fuel reduction
strategies, as public health intervention, which can reduce the
burden of COPD. Previous studies showed that the adoption
of clean fuel may be beneﬁcial for preventing COPD (36).
Meanwhile, the elevated risks associated with historical solid fuel
use may still be attenuated by switching to clean fuels later in
life (27, 36). A retrospective cohort study reported signiﬁcantly
lower risks of COPD in lifelong coal users who adopted a
ventilated stove for cooking than in those who did not (37). This
should encourage greater eﬀorts to facilitate universal access to
clean energy, as promoted by the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goal (38).
Previous
pulmonary
tuberculosis
was
reported
to
be
associated with airway ﬁbrosis, and may lead to lung scarring
and airway damage (7, 39). The BOLD and PLATINO studies
revealed stronger associations between self-reported history
of tuberculosis and COPD in people who had never smoked
(6, 39). Similarly, in our study, the history of tuberculosis
was closely related to the diagnosis of COPD among never-
smokers.
Therefore,
eﬀective
measures
for
preventing
tuberculosis are important in the prevention of COPD in
this population.
Living in a rural area and increasing age were associated
with a higher rate of COPD in our study, which is consistent
with previous ﬁndings. For example, rural residence was
previously reported to be an independent risk factor for COPD
among never-smokers (28). The association between COPD
and older age among never-smokers could be attributable to
the accumulative eﬀects of risk factors over time and the
age-related weakening of respiratory muscles that leads to
decreased FEV1/FVC, as determined by standardized spirometry
tests (40).
There are some limitations to our study. First, these data
were cross-sectional and we are unable to draw ﬁrm conclusions
in terms of causation and measure other potential risk factors.
Second, some analyses were limited by the design of the
questionnaire, which was intended to be comprehensive and easy
to administer, but in some cases prevented optimal detailed data
collection. We were unable to quantify direct exposure to solid
fuel beyond self-reported questionnaires. Third, with a male-
to-female ratio of 1 to 2 in our study sample, one may argue
that the results could not be generalizable to men. However,
in the gender-speciﬁc analysis (with 2,000 men), we found no
evidence of heterogeneity. Fourth, the diagnosis of small airway
dysfunction in this study was entirely based on spirometry, which
could be less accurate than pathological examination and imaging
techniques. Finally, those with asthma were not excluded from
the study population, which might cause an over-estimate of
COPD prevalence in younger age groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this study conﬁrmed the substantial burden of
COPD among never-smokers. Our data suggested that, apart
from exposure to solid fuel, history of tuberculosis, living in a
rural area and older age are associated with an increased risk of
COPD among never-smokers. Furthermore, we found a positive
association between solid fuel exposure and COPD or small
airway dysfunction.

Inﬂammatory responses have an important role in the onset of many lung diseases associated with urban air-
borne particulate matter (PM). Here we investigate eﬀects and mechanisms linked to PM-induced expression and
release of two main interleukins, IL-6 and IL-8, in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. The cells were
exposed to well characterized Milan city PM, winter PM2.5 (wPM2.5) and summer PM10 (sPM10), representing
combustion and non-combustion sources, respectively. Both wPM2.5 and sPM10 increased mRNA-synthesis and
intracellular protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8. Exposure to sPM10 also resulted in continuous and time-dependent
increases in release of IL-6 and IL-8 for up to 48 h. By comparison, in wPM2.5-exposed cells IL-8 release was not
signiﬁcantly augmented, while extracellular IL-6 levels were increased but remained constant beyond 24 h ex-
posure. Moreover, wPM2.5 also reduced the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-increased release of IL-8. No cytotoxicity
or signiﬁcant adsorption of cytokines to wPM2.5 were observed. Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy revealed an
accumulation of IL-8 in intracellular vesicles and alterations in actin ﬁlament organization in wPM2.5 exposed
cells, suggesting that the traﬃcking of vesicles carrying interleukins to the plasma membrane might be inhibited.
Thus, wPM2.5 appeared to impair cytokine release in BEAS-2B cells, in particular of IL-8, possibly by damaging
cytoskeletal function involved in protein secretion.
1. Introduction
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is among the most important en-
vironmental factors linked to adverse health eﬀects world-wide (WHO,
2013). An increased incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary
diseases has been related to PM exposure (Pope III et al., 2002). These
particle-induced eﬀects are considered the result of combined action of
various PM properties, giving rise to diﬀerent cellular damage and type
of responses (Kelly and Fussell, 2012). The ability of PM to directly or
indirectly increase the cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and to give rise to inﬂammatory responses is considered to be central
for the onset of many diseases (Nemmar et al., 2013).
The pro-inﬂammatory eﬀects of PM have been highlighted by sev-
eral experimental and epidemiological studies, revealing a positive as-
sociation between PM exposure and increased levels of inﬂammatory
markers in the airways (Upadhyay et al., 2014). PM has been shown to
promote the expression and release of a number of inﬂammatory
mediators (including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) both in in vivo (Farina
et al., 2013; Martin et al., 2007; Wegesser and Last, 2008) and in vitro
models (Camatini et al., 2012; Hetland et al., 2005; Veranth et al.,
2006). Coarse PM/PM10 are considered to be more potent than ﬁne
(PM2.5) and ultraﬁne PM. In fact a higher pro-inﬂammatory potential
of coarse PM has been shown in vitro in lung cell models (Becker et al.,
2005; Gualtieri et al., 2010), in vivo in animal models (Cho et al., 2009;
Gilmour et al., 2007; Schins et al., 2004) and in humans (Iskandar et al.,
2012; Samet et al., 2007). Experimental studies have revealed that the
release of coarse PM-induced cytokines is determined by both the
composition and size (Hetland et al., 2005; Veranth et al., 2006).
However, the organic fraction of diesel PM, a central component of
PM2.5, seems to have a higher pro-inﬂammatory potential than the
washed PM (Totlandsdal et al., 2012).
Interestingly,
Alfaro-Moreno
and
collaborators
(Alfaro-Moreno
et al., 2009) reported an increased release of interleukin-6 (IL-6)
combined with a decreased release of IL-8 in Calu-3 cells following

exposure to city PM2.5. Similar ﬁndings have been seen in another
human lung epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B cells, following exposure to
diesel PM and diesel PM extracts (Totlandsdal et al., 2015; Totlandsdal
et al., 2012) and PM2.5 extracts (Fuentes-Mattei et al., 2010), sug-
gesting that some components in ﬁne PMs may diﬀerentially aﬀect IL-6
and IL-8.
The interest in PM-induced cytokines and chemokine release resides
in the fundamental role these molecules play in orchestrating innate
and adaptive immunity. Interleukin-6 is a cytokine not only involved in
inﬂammation and infection responses, but also in the regulation of
metabolic, regenerative, and neural processes (Scheller et al., 2011). IL-
8 or CXCL8 is the most potent neutrophil-recruiting chemokine (Fox
et al., 2005), and is associated with several patho-physiological states in
the airways, including broncho-constriction, edema, and neutrophilia
(Gangur et al., 2002). The correct balance between pro- and anti-in-
ﬂammatory responses is necessary for the maintenance of tissues and
organs homeostasis, while the suppression of inﬂammatory responses
could impair protective responses against external threats, including
bacterial infections.
Using well characterized Milan city PM (Mantecca et al., 2012), we
here further explore the eﬀects and mechanisms related to IL-8 and IL-6
release in BEAS-2B cells. Accordingly to other studies, we have pre-
viously reported signiﬁcant diﬀerences in pro-inﬂammatory potency
and responses of the various PM size fractions sampled in Milan during
diﬀerent seasons (Gualtieri et al., 2010). In particular, summer PM10
(sPM10) was most eﬀective in inducing interleukins release in all the
cell lines investigated (Longhin et al., 2013b). On the contrary, winter
PM2.5 (wPM2.5) had minimal eﬀects on this endpoint in various cell
lines. In a more recent study on human bronchial BEAS-2B cells, we
found that while wPM2.5 slightly but signiﬁcantly increased the release
of IL-6, the level of IL-8 was unaﬀected. Most interestingly, genome
wide analyses suggested that both IL-6 and IL-8 mRNAs were increased
(Longhin et al., 2016).
Thus, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the diﬀerential
eﬀects of Milan city PM on IL-6 and IL-8 release. To explore further the
role of source and particles chemical composition, both wPM2.5 and
sPM10 were used. The study veriﬁes that wPM2.5 and sPM10 induced
IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression and protein synthesis. However, fol-
lowing wPM2.5 a corresponding enhanced IL-8 release was not ob-
served. More speciﬁcally, wPM2.5 reduced the increased release of IL-8
triggered by the potent interleukins inducer lipopolysaccharides (LPS),
living IL-6 secretion unaﬀected. This reduction was not an artefact due
to a speciﬁc adsorption of IL-8 to PM carbon core, but seemed to be due
to impaired IL-8 release. Fluorescence microscopy revealed an accu-
mulation of IL-8 protein in intracellular vesicles and disruption of actin
ﬁlaments occurring at non-cytotoxic concentrations, suggesting a pri-
mary role for cytoskeleton alterations.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and kits
LHC-9 medium was purchased from Gibco, Life Technologies (NY,
USA) and PureCol™collagen from Inamed Biomaterials (Fremont, CA,
USA). Cell culture ﬂasks were obtained from Nunc A/S, Roskilde,
Denmark and 6-well plates and 10 cm culture discs from Corning,
Lowell, MA, USA. Rhodamine phalloidin for actin was purchased from
Cytoskeleton Inc. β-tubulin for microtubules staining was purchased
from Cell Signaling. Alexaﬂuor secondary antibodies and ELISA
CytoSets for IL-6 and CXCL8/IL-8 were purchased from Invitrogen Life
Technologies Ltd., UK. IL-8 and IL-6 primary antibodies for microscopy
were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich and Life Technologies, respec-
tively.
The Absolutely RNA™reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) Miniprep kit was from Stratagene California (La Jolla,
CA, USA). The predesigned TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays, TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix, and the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit
were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. All other chemicals
were purchased from commercial sources at the highest purity avail-
able.
2.2. PM sampling and preparation for biological experiments
PM samples were collected during winter and summer 2012 at Torre
Sarca, a site of urban background for atmospheric pollution in Milan.
Samplings were performed by a low volume gravimetric sampler (FAI
Instruments, Rome, Italy) on Teﬂon ﬁlters, which were replaced every
24 h and then stored at −20 °C until extraction. Samples from one
season were pooled and particles were extracted as previously de-
scribed (Longhin et al., 2013a). Brieﬂy, ﬁlters were put in a glass vial
with 2 mL of sterile water and underwent 20 min sonication in an ul-
trasound bath (SONICA, Soltec). Four sonication cycles were performed
and the extraction water was collected and replaced every time. The
volumes obtained from the four cycles were put together to obtain a
homogeneous sample. Particle suspensions were dried in a desiccator,
weighed and stored at −20 °C, and the resulting pellets were re-sus-
pended in sterile water (2 μg/μL) just prior to use.
Data on the PMs chemical composition and physical properties have
been previously published (Mantecca et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, chemical
characterization was performed on Teﬂon ﬁlter sampled PM, according
to standard chemical procedure for airborne PM characterization
(Perrone et al., 2010). The results showed that sPM10 had higher me-
tals and endotoxins content, while wPM2.5 was enriched in organic
compounds including PAHs.
2.3. Cells culture and exposure
BEAS-2B cells, a SV40-transformed human bronchial epithelial cell
line, were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures
(ECACC, Salisbury, UK). Cells were maintained in LHC-9 medium at
37 °C with 5% of CO2, with refreshment of medium every other day.
Cells for experiments were seeded at a concentration of 300,000 cells/
well into collagen-coated 6-well plates and treated the day after with
10 μg/cm2 (100 μg/mL) of PM, which is within an in vitro dosing range
estimated to be relevant for high-dose exposure levels in urban en-
vironments (Li et al., 2003). Winter PM2.5 (wPM2.5) and summer
PM10 (sPM10) were used to assess the role of PM chemical composition
in the IL-8 decreased release. The exposure dose and PMs fractions were
selected according to previous results, in order to further investigate the
highlighted aspects with regard to interleukins gene expression and
release (Longhin et al., 2016). Previous data on PM-cytotoxicity on
BEAS-2B cells show no eﬀects on viability at the selected dose (Gualtieri
et al., 2010). Lipopolysaccharides standard (LPS; 5.5 EU/well) was
added to the medium as a positive control to induce a non-PM triggered
inﬂammatory response in cells. Besides, we also used LPS in combina-
tion with particles to investigate the eﬀect of PM on the mechanisms
related to interleukins release. After 6 or 24 h (plus 30 and 48 h for
some experiments) of exposure to PM and/or LPS the cellular responses
were examined.
2.4. Cell viability
Cell viability was assessed by Alamar-Blue assay. Alamar-Blue was
directly added to fresh cells culture medium (1:10) and cells were in-
cubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance of each sample was measured
at 570 and 630 nm, and compared to control values (Supplementary
data 1). The measured absorbance is proportional to the number of
living cells and corresponds to the cells metabolic activity.
2.5. Gene expression
IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8 mRNA levels were determined by real-time

PCR. Total mRNA was isolated from cells according to the supplier's
recommendations using the Absolutely RNA™RT-PCR Miniprep kit, and
reverse transcribed to cDNA on a PCR System 2400 (PerkinElmer) using
a High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc). Real-time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems

Gene
Expression Assays (18S rRNA, Hs99999901_s1, IL-6 Hs00174131_m1,
and CXCL8, Hs00174103_m1) and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix.
For these analyses, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to com-
plementary (c)DNA using a High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit. The
cDNAs were diluted 1:20 in a solution of nuclease-free water, TaqMan
Universal Master Mix, primers, and probe before performing the real-
time PCR. The expression of each gene of interest (GOI) in each sample
was normalized against housekeeping genes (18S rRNA), and expressed
as the fold change compared to the control (untreated cells), as calcu-
lated by the ΔΔCt-method: (ΔCt = Ct[Gene of Interest] −Ct[18S];
ΔΔCt = ΔCt[Treated] −ΔCt[Control]; Fold change = 2[−ΔΔCt]).
2.6. ELISA
IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8 intracellular and released protein levels were
measured by ELISA. After exposure, the cells supernatants were col-
lected. The well plates with cells were put overnight at −20 °C. The day
after the cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buﬀer (150 mM NaCl, 1%
TritonX-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0
and 0.1% of protease inhibitors, added just before use). Both super-
natants and lysates were centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) and
stored at −20 °C. The test was performed according to the manufac-
turer's guidelines. The absorbance of each sample was measured by
Multiplate Reader Ascent (Thermo) at 450 nm and 630 nm, and the
amount of proteins in pg/mL calculated on the basis of a standard
curve.
Since previous works reported ILs binding on carbonaceous particles
(Kocbach et al., 2008), we also carried out experiments to measure this
phenomenon in our samples. IL-6 and IL-8 standards at know con-
centrations have been added to wells containing cell culture media
only, and incubated with or without wPM2.5 at the exposure dose
(100 μg/mL). wPM2.5 was chosen since it likely has higher adsorption
potential, presenting higher content of elemental carbon and smaller
particles, i.e. higher adsorption surface, with respect to sPM10. After
24 h ELISA was carried out (Supplementary data 2).
2.7. Microscopy
For the detection of IL-8, IL-6, actin and β-tubulin, samples were
prepared following
common ﬂuorescence microscopy
techniques.
Brieﬂy, cells grown on cover slips and exposed to wPM2.5 were washed
in PBS and ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice.
Permeabilization and blocking were performed in PBS with 0.5% BSA
and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then
labelled with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (IL-8 and IL-6, 10 μg/
mL) or with rhodamine phalloidin for actin (100 nM, Cytoskeleton
Inc.), β-tubulin (1:100 dilution; Cell Signaling) in PBS at room tem-
perature for 30 min. For detection of ILs, appropriate Alexaﬂuor sec-
ondary antibodies (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen) were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature. Cells' DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Slides
were observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope (AxioObserver, Zeiss
Germany) and digital images were taken.
2.8. Statistical analyses
Mean and standard error of mean (SEM) of at least three in-
dependent experiments (independent biological replicates) are re-
ported. Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Stat 3.1 soft-
ware, using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni or Dunn's as a post hoc
test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
In order to investigate the inﬂammatory mechanisms activated by
urban PM, the gene expression and protein secretion of two key med-
iators, IL-6 and IL-8, were measured in bronchial BEAS-2B cells exposed
to particles for 6 and 24 h. At these time points there are no sign of
cytotoxicity as determined by the Alamar-Blue assay (Supplementary
data 1).
The expression (mRNA) and release of IL-6 were increased at the
investigated time-points, from cells exposed to both wPM2.5 and
sPM10 (Fig. 1a and c). Both PM also increased the expression of IL-8
after 24 h of exposure, with sPM10 apparently somewhat more potent
than wPM2.5 (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, statistically signiﬁcant increases
in levels of IL-8 protein were only seen in the supernatants of cells
treated with sPM10, and not after wPM2.5 (Fig. 1d).
Protein secretion was further measured at 30 and 48 h of exposure,

to explore the possibility of a delayed IL-8 release following wPM2.5
exposure (Fig. 2). wPM2.5-induced IL-6 release was constant at the
later time points, however, an increase in IL-8 secretion was still not
observed. In contrast, sPM10 further increased the secretion of both IL-
6 and IL-8 also at the later time points.
To further explore the mismatch between IL-8 gene expression and
IL-8 protein release, intracellular protein levels were next analysed
(Fig. 3a). The results show that wPM2.5 increased the synthesis of both
IL-6 (3.3 fold) and IL-8 proteins (2.5 fold), as judged by their increased
intracellular levels compared to untreated control cells. However, only
IL-6 was secreted, conﬁrming the previous data. The intracellular ac-
cumulation of IL-8 was also validated by microscopy investigations
(Fig. 3b), showing an augmented signal of immunostained protein,
organized in spots that suggest compartmentalization in vesicles. In
particular, exposure to wPM2.5 seemed to increase the number and size
of the spots. In contrast, no clear compartmentalization of IL-6 fol-
lowing wPM2.5 could be seen.
IL-6 and IL-8 adsorption on particles was measured to check its
possible contribution to the apparent lack of IL-8 secretion. A slight IL-8
adsorption was observed. Reduction of measured standard in presence
of PM was 20 ± 8% with 400 pg/mL of IL-8 standard and 13 ± 0.1%
with 100 pg/mL of IL-8 standard (Supplementary data 2). Considering
the intracellular amount of IL-8 (151 pg/mL, FI 2.5 over control), ad-
sorption on particles cannot explain the complete lack of extracellular
protein. No IL-6 adsorption was observed.
Thus, our data suggest that wPM2.5 speciﬁcally impaired the se-
cretion of the synthetized IL-8, while IL-6 secretion seems to be un-
aﬀected. To test this hypothesis, BEAS-2B cells were exposed to LPS
with or without wPM2.5 (Fig. 4). Statistically signiﬁcant induction in
IL-8 release induced by LPS was lost after co-treatment with wPM2.5. In
contrast, no eﬀects of wPM were observed on the intracellular and se-
creted levels of IL-6 in LPS-exposed cells.
Next, we investigated if particle exposure could aﬀect the cytoske-
leton organization, as this is an essential element for vesicular transport
within the cells. Fig. 5a shows alterations in actin organization in cells
exposed to particles after 24 h (Fig. 5a-iv), but not after 6 h (Fig. 5a-iii).
Untreated cells (Fig. 5a-i,ii) and cells exposed for 6 h (Fig. 5a-iii) pre-
sent actin ﬁlaments in the cytoplasm and near the cell periphery, while
samples exposed to wPM2.5 for 24 h (Fig. 5a-iv) almost completely lack
these structures. Fine and short actin projections could also be observed
in these cells, along with a slightly alteration of morphology, appearing
as cellular shrinkage. Interestingly, these alterations were not obviously
present after 6 h of exposure, nor in samples exposed to sPM10 up to
24 h (Fig. 5a-v, vi) or in LPS exposed samples (Supplementary data 3).
Staining of microtubules' β-tubulin did not highlight major alterations
of these structures, as long ﬁlaments can be observed in both control
and exposed cells, and the total intensity of ﬂuorescence signal, as
measured by AxioVision Microscope Software, was similar in control
cells and exposed samples (data not shown). However, a slight diﬀer-
ence can be observed in the morphological organization of the micro-
tubules that in control cells present a perinuclear grouping, likely de-
parting from the area of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC,
Fig. 5b, arrow heads). This area is more diﬃcult to detect in wPM2.5
exposed cells (Fig. 5b).
4. Discussion
The correct functioning of the inﬂammatory responses is important
for the maintenance of tissues and organs homeostasis. Here we in-
vestigated the inﬂammatory processes induced by well- characterized
ambient Milan wPM2.5 and sPM10 (Mantecca et al., 2012) in bronchial
epithelial BEAS-2B cells, by analyzing two main interleukins, IL-6 and
IL-8. Interestingly, both urban PMs increased mRNA expression and
intracellular protein levels of IL-6 and IL-8 at non-cytotoxic con-
centrations. While wPM2.5 induced only the release of IL-6, sPM10
increased the release of both proteins. Similarly, exposure to wPM2.5
speciﬁcally reduced the release of LPS-induced IL-8 synthesis. ELISA
and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy analysis revealed that wPM2.5
resulted in an accumulation of IL-8 in intracellular vesicles. This eﬀect
was accompanied by alterations in the actin ﬁlament organization,
suggesting that wPM2.5 reduced the transport of IL-8 vesicles to the
plasma membrane.
sPM10 presents mostly mineral particles with high content of metals
and endotoxins, while wPM2.5 originating from combustion of organic
material including diesel are agglomerates of smaller carbon particles
with organic chemicals including PAHs attached (Mantecca et al.,
2012). It is well-known that various mineral PM as such induces cyto-
kines (Øvrevik et al., 2009). Accordingly, we here ﬁnd increased ex-
pression and excretion of IL-6 and IL-8 following exposure to Milan
sPM10. We have previously reported that these inﬂammatory reactions
partly are depending on the endotoxin content (Camatini et al., 2012).
In contrast, we have found that diesel PM-induced IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8
responses in BEAS-2B cells are caused by methanol extractable con-
stituents, in particular found in the non-polar fraction (Bach et al.,
2015; Totlandsdal et al., 2012; Totlandsdal et al., 2010). In contrast, the
residual diesel PM gave almost no inﬂammatory responses (Totlandsdal
et al., 2012). Furthermore, the increased expression of cytokines were
found to be at least partly depending on CYP-activity and formation of
reactive molecules/ROS, suggesting a role for compounds such as PAHs
(Bach et al., 2015). It is, however, important to note that the in-
ﬂammatory potency of various combustion PMs are highly variable and
obviously much depending on the speciﬁc composition of chemicals
adsorbed (Becker et al., 2005; Schins et al., 2004; Totlandsdal et al.,
2015; Totlandsdal et al., 2014). This also seems to be the case for IL-8/
CXCL8 responses in BEAS-2B cells, as both increased (Rodríguez-Cotto
et al., 2013; Yan et al., 2016) and decreased IL-8 release after exposure
to PM2.5 have been reported (Gioda et al., 2011; Rodríguez-Cotto et al.,
2014). Thus, the diﬀerent chemical composition of the various urban
air PM2.5 used is likely to explain most of the diverse results reported.
In fact, particles composition is not only depending on the source, but

also on the sampling and extraction procedures.
Also a mismatch between IL-8 induced gene expression and lack of
increased release has previously been reported following exposure to
urban PM2.5 (Alfaro-Moreno et al., 2009; Kocbach et al., 2008). Similar
eﬀects have more speciﬁcally also been seen after exposure to diesel PM
(Totlandsdal et al., 2012). A suggested explanation for this observation
has been a speciﬁc adsorption of the IL-8 protein to carbonaceous
particles (Kocbach et al., 2008) or to other dust particles (Bauer et al.,
2012). However, incubating puriﬁed recombinant IL-8 with wPM2.5
only resulted in a slight adsorption of IL-8 to wPM2.5. This reduction
was certainly not suﬃcient to explain the near complete lack of en-
hanced IL-8 release following exposure to Milan wPM2.5, and supports
previous ﬁndings by Alfaro-Moreno et al. (2009).
In the present study, we have further elucidated possible mechan-
isms linked to the lacking of increased IL-8-release following exposure
to PM2.5 by speciﬁcally analyzing the eﬀects on gene expression and
intracellular content of IL-8. Here we ﬁnd that wPM2.5 not only up-
regulated IL-8 gene expression comparable to its eﬀect on IL-6, but also
stimulated IL-8 protein synthesis, as evident from the increased in-
tracellular levels identiﬁed by both ELISA and immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy. Furthermore, wPM2.5 speciﬁcally reduced the LPS-in-
creased release of IL-8, leaving IL-8 synthesis and IL-6 synthesis and
release unaﬀected. This supports the hypothesis of an inhibitory eﬀect
of wPM2.5 speciﬁcally aﬀecting IL-8 release. Of the 2 PM samples used
in this study, sPM10 has the highest content of crustal elements while
wPM2.5 has a higher content of organic matter (Mantecca et al., 2012).
It is therefore tempting to speculate that the inhibition of IL-8 release
could be due to PAHs or other organic chemicals of the wPM2.5 frac-
tion. In support of this, previous studies have shown that soluble ex-
tracts of PM (Fuentes-Mattei et al., 2010) and diesel exhaust PM
(Totlandsdal et al., 2014) also suppress IL-8 release. Also in accordance
with this, Rodríguez-Cotto and colleagues report a decrease of both IL-6
and IL-8 release in BEAS-2B cells exposed to industrial PM2.5, and
demonstrate that heavy metals are not responsible for this eﬀect since it
is not reverted by treatment with the metal chelator deferoxamine
mesylate (Rodríguez-Cotto et al., 2014).
The diﬀerential eﬀects of wPM2.5 on IL-6 and IL-8 release, suggest
that diﬀerent mechanisms may regulate the secretion of these two cy-
tokines in BEAS-2B cells. This hypothesis is supported by recent lit-
erature reporting that cellular secretion of various cytokines occurs
through diﬀerent pathways (Stanley and Lacy, 2010). Indeed, diﬀerent
pathways have previously been described for IL-6 and IL-8 secretion in
diﬀerent cell types. IL-6 has been related to constitutive exocytosis in
macrophages (Manderson et al., 2007; Murray and Stow, 2014) and
mast cells (Lacy and Stow, 2011), where it has been shown to be di-
rectly secreted after synthesis by a mechanism that is independent from

Ca2+ inﬂux and degranulation (Kandere-Grzybowska et al., 2003). In
endothelial cells IL-8 was found to be pre-stored in speciﬁc storage
granules, Weibel-Palade bodies, and released after stimulation as cAMP
and Ca2+ increase (Rondaij et al., 2006). The cytoskeleton remodeling
has an important role in proteins exocytosis. Actin ﬁbers were reported
to participate in the motility of secretory granules, while it has been
suggested that microtubules, but not actin ﬁlaments, are responsible for
transport and fusion dynamics of constitutive post-Golgi secretory ve-
sicles (Schmoranzer and Simon, 2003). Signiﬁcantly, IL-8 secretion
from epithelial cells has been associated to Rho GTPases Rac1, Rac2,
and Cdc42, which modulate the actin cytoskeleton (Hobert et al.,
2002). Furthermore, it has recently been reported that the disruption of
centrosome, which organizes microtubules, leads to defects in IL-6 se-
cretion, while it does not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on IL-6 synthesis
(Vertii et al., 2016).
We have previously reported a modulation of genes involved in
cytoskeleton
organization
and
actin/tubulin
polymerization
(CDC42EP2, RAB7L1, and ARHGAP26) in Milan wPM2.5 exposed BEAS-
2B cells, accompanied by increased levels of the active phosphorylated
form of the actin-binding protein HSP27 (regulating cytoskeleton or-
ganization, Longhin et al., 2016), and centrosome ampliﬁcation
(Longhin et al., 2013a). Here we observe alterations of actin cytoske-
leton, consisting of ﬁbre loss and formation of membrane projections
after 24 h of wPM2.5 exposure. Cellular morphology is also aﬀected
with apparent shrinkage, suggesting that cell adhesion to the substrate
might be partly compromised, likely in relation to actin alteration
(Iwamoto and Calderwood, 2015). As the correct functioning of the
cytoskeleton is fundamental for numerous cell functions, here actin
alteration might be involved in lack of IL-8 secretion due to impaired
granules traﬃcking. Long microtubules ﬁlaments can be observed in
both control and exposed cells, supporting the idea that microtubules-
dependent IL-6 release is unaﬀected. However, the images seem to
present a weaker staining for β-tubulin in the area of the microtubule
organizing center (MTOC) in wPM2.5 exposed cells, suggesting a pos-
sible eﬀect on centrosomes similar to the one reported by Vertii et al.
(2016). Notably, wPM2.5-induced IL-6 secretion seemed to be triggered
prior to IL-8 release, and did not increase beyond 24 h (in contrast to
sPM10-induced IL-6 release) when the cytoskeletal eﬀects were ob-
served. Thus, the contrasting impact on IL-6 and IL-8 could also be
related to the diﬀerence in timing of synthesis and release of these two
cytokines, upon wPM2.5 exposure. The possibility that cytoskeletal
modulation could have a more broad impact on secretory mechanism in
general, should therefore not be completely omitted. Additionally, up-
regulation of some genes and pathways, as well as mucin proteins in the
mucosal airway surfaces, has been suggested to reduce PM-induced IL-8
secretion following in vivo exposure (Fuentes-Mattei et al., 2010).
A possible important implication of these PM2.5-eﬀects could be
reduced and/or unbalanced immune responses following pulmonary
infections, as underscored by the suppression of LPS-increased IL-8
release. This may have further implications for the recruitment of im-
mune cells and thus potentially increase susceptibility to lung diseases.
Despite the fact that IL-6 could be measured in the cells supernatants,
further investigations are required to verify possible eﬀects on the re-
lease of this and other inﬂammatory mediators. It would also be im-
portant to clarify whether sustained exposure to lower PM concentra-
tions, more realistic of real-life exposure conditions, could suppress the
release of inﬂammatory mediators and impair secretory functions in a
similar manner.
In conclusion, here we demonstrate that Milan wPM2.5 exposure,
despite being able to initiate pro-inﬂammatory responses in BEAS-2B
cells, impairs the expected enhanced release of IL-8. This eﬀect seems to
be due to alterations of the cells cytoskeleton leading to impaired
traﬃcking of secretory vesicles.

Fly ash from municipal waste incineration contains large amounts of hazardous trace elements. In this study, the 
total contents and chemical forms of 13 hazardous trace elements (Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba, Co 
and Sb) in MSWI fly ash during one week were analyzed in order to reveal their environmental leaching risk and 
migration capacity. The contents of the different trace elements varied greatly, with the lowest amount, only 
3.75 μg/g, recorded for Se and the highest amount of up to 2009.43 μg/g for Zn. The effective fractions of all 
elements exceeded 20%, and the effective fraction of Cd was as high as 97.16%. The risk of each trace element in 
MSWI fly ash was evaluated using the RAC method and Nemerow Pollution Index method. The RAC evaluation 
showed that all trace elements pose at least a low risk to the environment. The Nemerow Pollution Index analysis 
indicated that the risk of Cd and Sb is extremely high and results in a “Seriously polluted” risk level for the 
combined fly ash contamination. Therefore, suitable measures should be taken to avoid harm to the surrounding 
environment before MSWI fly ash is discharged.   
1. Introduction 
As China’s urbanization process accelerates, cities continue to 
expand, the urban population grows and the consumption level of urban 
residents rises, generating a large amount of municipal solid waste 
(MSW), which also continues to grow rapidly. According to the statis­
tical data of the National Statistical Yearbook, the volume of domestic 
waste collection in China from 2009 to 2019 has increased from 157.34 
million tons in 2009 to 242.06 million tons in 2019 [1]. The randomly 
deposited urban household waste occupies a large amount of land re­
sources, and also poses a serious threat to the surrounding environment 
and the health of residents [2,3]. Waste that has not been treated in a 
sound manner can damage the soil aggregate structure, leading to 
increased levels of trace elements and disease-causing bacteria in the soil 
and impeding the normal growth of crops [4]. The presence of dust and 
harmful gases generated by decomposition in municipal solid waste will 
aggravate air pollution, and the seepage of trace elements and organic 
pollutants will contaminate groundwater, bringing serious environ­
mental pollution problems and endangering human health at the same 
time [5]. How to dispose of the huge and fast-growing stock of MSW has 
become an important issue that needs to be solved [6]. China attaches 
great importance to the development of municipal solid waste disposal 
technology, has introduced relevant laws and regulations, and has 
strongly promoted the safe utilization of resources from municipal solid 
waste [7]. 
At this stage, there are three main methods of safe waste disposal in 
China: landfill, composting and incineration [8]. Incineration treatment 
utilizes a high temperature environment during the combustion process 
to achieve the treatment effect of waste reduction and volume reduction, 
and at the same time, it can use the energy generated by the waste 
incineration process to realize the resource utilization of waste [9]. 
Waste incineration technology has become the main disposal method of 
municipal waste in China by virtue of its reduction, safety and use of 
resources [10], and in 2020 the national domestic waste removal and 
transportation volume reached 235.117 million tons, of which 146.076 
million tons were incinerated, accounting for 62.29% of the safe 
disposal volume of domestic waste in that year [1]. The final products of 
MSW treatment by incineration are flue gas and solid residues, of which

the solid residues are mainly divided into bottom ash and fly ash, ac­
counting for about one-third of the total waste [11]. Bottom ash is 
generally considered a safe and stable product, and can be used for road 
base construction or as an additive raw material for cement preparation, 
or be sent directly to landfill because of the low content of trace element 
pollutants and organic pollutants contained in bottom ash, which is a 
general solid waste [12,13]. In addition, the incineration of MSW will 
produce waste incineration fly ash (referred to as fly ash), which ac­
counts for 2%–12% of the total primary waste [10]. Compared with 
bottom ash, fly ash has smaller particles, with a rougher surface and 
higher porosity [14]. Fly ash will polymerize very easily and form 
irregular agglomerates, which can easily adsorb trace element pollutants 
and organic pollutants in the flue gas, and is classified as hazardous 
waste in the National List of Hazardous Waste [15]. It belongs to the 
HW18 category of hazardous waste, which poses a serious threat to the 
ecological environment and human health if disposed of improperly 
[16]. 
Fly ash is the residue collected by the flue gas purification system of 
waste incineration power plants [17]. Fly ash contains large amounts of 
hazardous trace elements (e.g., Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni, etc.) and organic pol­
lutants (e.g., dioxins, furans, etc.) that are absorbed by living organisms 
mainly from contamination of the natural environment [18]. Trace el­
ements in waste are mainly present in the form of oxides and salts and 
are concentrated in fly ash by evaporation, condensation, particle 
entrapment and precipitation during incineration [19]. Li, et al. [20] 
studied the distribution of trace elements in the flue gas purification 
system of a waste incineration plant in Zhejiang province and found that 
Hg, Cd, As, Pb and Zn mainly entered the fly ash by evaporation, 
condensation and adsorption, while Se and Cr entered in the fly ash by 
particle entrainment. The reducing atmosphere of the combustion 
environment and the high concentration of chlorine favoured the vola­
tilization of Cu, Zn and Pb. Zhou, et al. [21] found that the change in 
particle size of fly ash influenced the distribution of trace element 
content and types, and in the particle size range of 1–10 μm, the main 
phases of fly ash included calcite, NaCl, KCl and calcium silicate, etc. 
These phases gradually decreased with decreasing particle size, 
accompanied by the evolution of crystalline phases, about 87% Zn, 76% 
Cu, 62% Pb and 75% Cd entered in the fly ash in this particle size range. 
Moreover, the leaching concentration of trace elements increases with 
decreasing particle size and indicates that the leachability of trace ele­
ments is influenced by a combination of chloride and sulphate dissolu­
tion, weak surface adsorption and Al/Fe oxide surface complexation 
[22]. Trace elements in fly ash will be leached or permeated out during 
the treatment and disposal process and enter into the surrounding 
environment and geology. The heavy metals contained in fly ash are 
subject to leaching during resourceful use [23]. Zhao, et al. [24] indi­
cated that most heavy metals, such as Pb, Cr, Zn, and Cd in MSW fly ash 
are 10–100 times higher than those in the soil. Cetin, et al. [25] found 
that increasing the amount of fly ash in roadbeds increased the leaching 
concentration of heavy metals such as Ba and Cu. The ingestion of trace 
amounts of trace elements by humans can lead to acute poisoning. The 
uptake of trace elements by crops can lead to malnutrition and low 
harvests. Trace elements can also migrate and transform in the envi­
ronment, causing trace element contamination of soil and groundwater 
[26]. Therefore, a comprehensive study of trace element leaching 
characteristics and environmental risk assessment is necessary. In pre­
vious studies, 26 trace elements were considered to have an impact on 
the environment, and were classified into three categories: Class I, Class 
II and Class III according to their different degrees of hazard, as detailed 
in Table S1 [27]. Most of the existing studies in the literature focus on 
certain Class I and a small number of Class II elements in the municipal 
solid waste incineration fly ash. In addition, because of the uneven types 
of waste deposited every day, resulting in different batches of waste 
incineration fly ash with different compositions, it is also important to 
collate and study the trace element properties of fly ash at different 
times. 
In this study, one-week of fly ash samples from a typical waste 
incineration plant were analyzed for the chemical species of 13 trace 
elements from Class I, Class II and Class III using the BCR method. Based 
on the content and distribution of trace elements in waste incineration 
fly ash, the environmental stability and biological activity of these ele­
ments can be understood in more detail. Further, it is hoped that the 
migration capacity of trace element in waste fly ash can be revealed to 
provide appropriate guidance and assistance for further treatment and 
utilization of waste incineration fly ash. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Experimental materials 
The fly ash collected from the bag filter of a typical grate furnace 
waste incineration power plant in China was selected as the object of 
study in this research. There is randomness in studying the environ­
mental hazards of MSWI fly ash on only one day, so sampling starts on a 
randomly selected day and is collected for one week in succession to 
draw generalised conclusions. In this study, 13 trace elements (Hg, As, 
Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba, Co and Sb) were selected from the 
above 26 hazardous trace elements for focused studies, based on the 
Chinese and the United States definitions of ecological soil contami­
nants, and the toxicity characteristics and content distribution in fly ash. 
All six trace elements in Class I, and four and three trace elements in 
Class II and Class III were selected as the focus of the investigation, 
depending on the degree of hazard (The specific classification of the 26 
hazardous trace elements is shown in Table S1). 
Hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO3), hydrofluoric acid (HF), 
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH), hydroxyl­
amine 
hydrochloride 
(HONH2HCl) 
and 
ammonium 
acetate 
(CH3COONH4) used in this study were all of guaranteed reagent grade. 
Unless otherwise stated, no further purification is required for use. 
Liquid standard samples of trace elements were purchased from the 
General Research Institute of Nonferrous Metals (GRINM). The deion­
ized water used in this study was produced by the TTL-10A ultrapure 
water system (Beijing TongTaiLian Technology Development Co., Ltd.). 
2.2. Experimental protocol 
The samples of waste incineration fly ash taken over seven days in 
one week were subjected to full digestion and the content of the major 
elements in the samples was determined using inductively coupled 
plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Leeman Labs, USA). 
The total concentrations of the 13 trace elements selected for the study 
were measured using the appropriate Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) test methods with the correct laboratory equipment. To better 
investigate the compound morphology and leaching toxicity of trace 
elements, typical anion concentrations in the fully digested solution 
were measured using an ion chromatograph (ICS-1100, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). 
The European Community Bureau of Reference (ECBR) has proposed 
a multi-stage sequential extraction method (BCR sequential extraction 
method). The trace elements are divided into four different forms ac­
cording to the ease of leaching: mild acido-soluble fraction, reducible 
fraction, oxidizable fraction and residual fraction [28]. Among the four 
forms, the trace elements in the mild acido-soluble fraction can be 
released to the surrounding environment in acidic aqueous solution, 
which is the most harmful to human beings and the environment; the 
reducible and oxidizable fractions are more stable, but can be released 
under suitable redox conditions; the residue fraction is usually called the 
invalid state, and the trace elements in the residue state can only be 
released to the environment under strong acid decomposition condi­
tions, which is the most stable form of trace elements and basically 
harmless to the environment. In this study, the Chinese method GB/T 
25282-2010 was used as a reference. According to the laboratory 
Y. Lou et al.

conditions and experimental requirements, the BCR sequential extrac­
tion method was slightly improved by adding an extraction experiment 
with deionized water as the extracting agent before the mild acid 
extraction. The fly in the ointment is that the traditional BCR method 
causes a decrease in the recovery rate of mercury [27,29,30]. Due to the 
volatility of Hg, during the experiment, some unavoidable operations, 
such as adding aqueous solution, heating the solution, or even simply 
exposing the sample to the air, may cause the loss of Hg, thereby 
reducing the mass balance [31].To address this problem, this study 
deliberately adopted the improved BCR method proposed by Bian, et al. 
[32] for the sequential extraction of Hg, thus making it possible to 
analyze the occurrence form of Hg in fly ash. The detailed steps for both 
BCR methods are shown in Table S2 and Table S3. 
2.3. Characterizations 
One-week’s fly ash samples were scanned using an X-ray diffrac­
tometer (XRD) in the range of 5-90◦at a scan rate of 10◦/min. The 
specific surface area (S), total pore volume (V) and average pore radius 
(R) of the samples were tested by a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller phys­
isorption device (Autosorb-iQ-MP, Quantachrome). 
2.4. Risk assessments 
The migration, transformation and final presence of trace element 
pollutants in the environment is one of the key research areas in envi­
ronmental science. However, the migration and transformation of trace 
elements in the natural environment does not depend entirely on their 
total concentration, but also in large part on the characteristics of their 
chemical morphology [33]. The BCR method provides availability in­
dicators including the percentage of water-soluble and acid-soluble 
fractions, which can be used to analyze the distribution of different 
chemical forms of trace elements. The water-soluble and acid-soluble 
fractions (F1 + F2) are considered to be the weaker bound states of 
the trace element compound forms due to their solubility in the aqueous 
phase, and may participate more rapidly in the ecological cycle [34]. In 
view of this, the Risk Assessment Code (RAC) can be used to evaluate the 
adverse impacts of trace elements on the ecology of the environment, the 
quality of the environment and human health [35]. The RAC method 
focuses on the percentage content and provides the best visual repre­
sentation of the proportion of heavy metals involved in the biological 
cycle, thus evaluating the individual environmental risk of each heavy 
metal. According to the proportion of water-soluble and acid-soluble 
fractions (F1 + F2), with 1%, 10%, 30% and 50% as the dividing line, 
the risk of each trace element is divided into five levels, namely: no risk, 
low risk, medium risk, high risk and very high risk [36]. 
Risk Assessment Code (RAC) can only evaluate the environmental 
pollution risk of a single trace element, but the composition of pollutants 
is always intricate and complex, and RAC does not provide a compre­
hensive evaluation of the environmental hazards of trace elements in 
waste fly ash. For this reason, this study calculates the Nemerow 
Pollution Index (NPI) for waste incineration fly ash over a one-week 
period. The Nemerow Pollution Index is one of the most commonly 
used methods to calculate the comprehensive pollution index of pol­
lutants [37]. The single pollution index (Pi), similar to the RAC, mea­
sures the main trace element pollutants and their hazards, and is 
calculated as a comparison of actual measured trace element levels with 
evaluation criteria. 
Pi = Ci
SI
(1)  
where Ci is the sum of the F1 and F2 contents of the i-th trace element in 
the BCR experiment (mg/kg) and SI is the Soil Environmental Quality 
Standard for trace elements (based on GB15618-1995 and EPA Eco-SSLs, 
detailed data shown in Table S4). 
In order to give a full picture of the overall contamination of the soil 
by waste fly ash, its comprehensive contamination index (PZ) was also 
calculated. The method first finds out the sub-index (exceedance 
multiplier) of each factor, then calculates the average of each sub-index, 
and then takes the maximum sub-index and the average value for further 
calculation. It highlights the influence and role of the pollutant with the 
largest pollution index on the environmental quality, and overcomes the 
shortcomings of the averaging method of sharing individual pollutant. 
The comprehensive contamination index is calculated as follows.

Different indicator values correspond to different pollution levels, as 
detailed in Table 1. where P is the weighted average of the single 
pollution index (Pi) for trace elements, calculated according to Eq. (3), 
where wi is the weighting factor for trace element i (detailed data shown 
in Table S5) and Pimax is the maximum value of Pi. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Contents of trace elements and macro elements in MSWI fly ash 
In this study, the concentrations of trace elements and macro ele­
ments in the waste incineration fly ash collected over a one-week period 
were tested, as shown in Fig. 1, and the detailed data are shown in 
Table S6 and Table S7. The content of different trace elements in waste 
incineration fly ash varies considerably. Overall, the 13 heavy metals 
were ranked as Se < Hg < Co < Ni < Cd < As < Sb < Cr < Mn < Cu < Pb 
< Ba < Zn, with concentrations ranging from 2.72 μg/g (Se) to 2308.48 
μg/g (Zn). Specifically, Se (2.72–4.43 μg/g), Hg (7.36–15.13 μg/g), Co 
(12.89–38.95 μg/g) and Ni (18.29–25.77 μg/g) are relatively low, with 
average levels below 50 μg/g, with Se in particular averaging less than 
10 μg/g. Slightly higher levels of trace elements Cd (23.69–66.76 μg/g), 
As (28.87–131.73 μg/g) and Sb (91.21–123.94 μg/g) are found, with 
average levels ranging from 51.91 to 109.18 μg/g. Cr (295.25–411.06 
μg/g), Mn (2.72–4.43 μg/g), Cu (386.70–677.26 μg/g) and Pb 
(321.48–685.97 μg/g) have somewhat higher concentrations in waste 
incineration fly ash, with average concentrations exceeding 300 μg/g, 
reaching 366.26–567.89 μg/g. The highest concentrations of trace ele­
ments in waste incineration fly ash were Ba (1002.24–1259.44 μg/g) 
and Zn (1670.32–2308.48 μg/g), with average concentrations of 
1076.21 μg/g and 2009.43 μg/g respectively. The reason for this phe­
nomenon is, on the one hand, the different contents of various trace 
elements in MSW, such as Se, Co, As and Sb, which are inherently low, 
and the high content of trace elements such as Zn, Ba and Pb [38,39]. On 
the other hand, the volatility of different trace elements varies, resulting 
in different percentages of different trace elements in the flue gas, fly ash 
and bottom ash. Wang, et al. [40] demonstrated that during MSW 
incineration, the majority of Hg is discharged as vapour in the flue gas; 
while Ni and Cr are mostly present in the bottom ash due to their high 
boiling points. The combination of these factors results in a large vari­
ation in the content of various trace elements in waste incineration fly 
ash. Nevertheless, the trace element content of waste incineration fly ash

is generally higher than that of fly ash from coal-fired power plants 
[30,41]. 
The main components of waste incineration fly ash are calcium 
silica-aluminium salts and chloride salts, and there are various systems 
such as CaO-SiO2-A12O3 ternary system, CaO-SO3-SiO2-Al2O3-Cl system 
and SiO2-Al2O3-metal oxide system [42]. The concentrations of typical 
anions in waste incineration fly ash were also tested by ion chroma­
tography in this study and are detailed in Table S8. However, the levels 
of Ca, Si and Al in waste incineration fly ash were high for all of the 
above systems. In order to reduce acidic gas emissions from MSW 
incineration, such as HCl and SO2, calcium-containing sorbents such as 
limestone are used, which leads to high levels of calcium salts, such as 
CaCl2 and CaSO4, being produced during flue gas treatment [10]. In 
contrast, high levels of Na and K are mainly due to the high proportion of 
kitchen and plastic waste in municipal solid waste [43]. If some quartz 
sand and pulverized coal are added during the incineration process, this 
can lead to an increase in the Fe content of the fly ash and further in­
crease the Si and Al content [10]. 
3.2. Speciation distribution of trace elements in MSWI fly ash 
In order to study the morphological distribution of 13 hazardous 
trace elements in municipal waste incineration fly ash more accurately, 
this study was conducted using the BCR sequential extraction method 
and the modified BCR method for one-week’s waste incineration fly ash 
samples. The results of the experiment are shown in Fig. 2 and the 
specific data are shown in Tables S9–S15. The mass recoveries of the 
experiments were accepted in the range of 70–130% [44], as shown in 
Fig. 2(a), and all results of this experiment were within the mass balance 
range and detailed data are shown in Table S16. Mass balances for most 
elements were below 100% due to errors in the experiments and mul­
tiple losses during the step-by-step extraction experiments. 
When trace elements enter the soil, they form different chemical 
forms and exhibit different activities through various actions such as 
dissolution, precipitation, coalescence and complexation and adsorp­
tion. Sequential extraction simulates various possible variations in nat­
ural and anthropogenic environmental conditions by the rational use of 
a series of selective reagents that successively dissolve different mineral 
phases that absorb trace element according to a weak to strong principle. 
With the exception of the residue fraction (F5), which is present in the 
lattice of minerals such as silicates and cannot be extracted, the other 
fractions are referred to as the “effective fraction”, i.e. F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 
[30,45]. F1 refers to metals adsorbed on soil, humus and other constit­
uents, sensitive to environmental changes, easily transformed by 
migration and able to be taken up by plants. F2 mostly refers to the co- 
precipitated bound state formed by heavy metal elements in the sample 
on carbonate minerals and is most sensitive to environmental condi­
tions, especially pH. When the pH drops, they are easily re-released into 
the environment. F3 and F4 are generally in the Fe-manganese oxide 
bound state, and when the pH and redox potential change, the release of 
heavy metals in the F3 and F4 forms is facilitated, which is mainly in 
response to the release of heavy metals due to environmental pollution 
from human activities. F5 is generally present in the lattice of soils as 
silicates, primary and secondary minerals, and is the result of natural 
geological weathering, and is not easily released under natural condi­
tions. In previous literature, F1 + F2 is generally referred to as “leach­
able part”, while F3 + F4 is “potentially leachable part” [45]. The 
effective fractions of 13 trace elements in the MSWI fly ash within the 
one week selected in this study are shown in Fig. 3. There was consid­
erable variation between the different trace elements, but the average 
effective fraction for all elements was above 20% (22.25–97.16%). This 
suggests that all elements discussed in this study will have a large impact 
on the environment and thus on organisms and even humans. 
Elemental activity, migration pathways, biological effectiveness and 
toxicity depend not only on the total amount but also, more often than 
not, on the form. Therefore, morphological analysis is the key to the 
study and prevention of pollution. As shown in Fig. 2(b–h), each element 
exhibits different release capacities under different environmental con­
ditions. The BCR sequential extraction experiment has improved the 
quality of evaluation by turning the original evaluation indicator of a 
single analysis of the full amount of an element into an analysis of the 
amount of each form of the element. In the following section, the 13 
trace elements studied will be divided into three groups according to the 
proportional relationship between the effective and residual fractions 
and taking into account the degree of hazard of the trace elements 
themselves, i.e. their attribution within the three classes of elements, 
and analyzed separately for their environmental hazards and potential 
causes. 
3.3. Forms of Class I elements 
Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd and Cr are classified as Class I elements due to their

high toxicity, but the ability of these trace elements to be released from 
MSWI fly ash under different environmental conditions varies consid­
erably, as shown in Fig. 3. 
As for Hg, as shown in Fig. 3, its effective fraction was in the ma­
jority, reaching about 90% (85.87–93.17%). Referring to Fig. 2, it can be 
seen that, except for the residue state, the other four forms of Hg 
accounted for a relatively uniform fraction. The acid soluble fraction 
(F2) has the lowest average percentage of about 9.63% and the oxidiz­
able fraction (F4) has the largest percentage of 37.95%. Some experi­
mental test results show that the main forms of Hg present in MSWI fly 
ash are Hg0, Hg-OM, HgCl2, HgO and HgSO4 [19]. HgSO4 and HgO are 
insoluble in water, HgCl2 can be dissolved in water, and HgCl2 can react 
with alkali metal chlorides (such as NaCl and KCl) to form [HgCl4]2−, 
which to some extent increases the solubility of HgCl2 in water. The 
acid-soluble fraction leaches and absorbs the lesser amount of HgO. 
Most of the mercury in the reducible fraction is present as the unstable 
Hg2Cl2, which is readily reduced to zero-valent mercury during the third 
extraction [46]. The large amount of acidic HCl gas produced during 
waste incineration also results in a high content of HgCl2 and Hg2Cl2 
itself, which leads to a larger proportion of elemental Hg in the water- 
soluble and reducible state (approximately 16.51% and 25.05%, 
respectively). The oxidizable extract contains a variety of complex 
mercury compounds, including Hg-OM compounds and mercury in 
various valence states [47]. HgSO4 is also absorbed under oxidizing 
agents and acidic conditions. In turn, due to the presence of water bath 
heating, a portion of Hg0 also escapes at this stage and is incorporated 
into F4. It is generally accepted that the predominant form of Hg in the 
residue is HgS, but studies have shown that HgS may also dissolve in a 
strongly oxidizing environment, as shown in Eq. (4) [48]. This partly 
explains why the fraction F4 is so high and F5 is particularly low (only 
1.24% on average). 
HgS(s) + 2O2(aq) + 2H2O ⇌Hg(OH)2(aq) + SO2−

For the As, as shown in Fig. 3, the effective fraction varies consid­
erably (23.06–71.10%). However, the average effective fraction is still 
close to 50% (45.93%), indicating that there is still a high chance that it 
will enter the biological cycle through water or soil and thus endanger 
human health. Arsenic in MSWI fly ash is mainly present as arsenate 
(AsO3 -
4
), ferromanganese compounds, arsenite (AsO3 -
3
), and arsenic 
oxides and sulphides. It has been pointed out that under high 
temperature oxidation conditions, As(III) exists mainly as gaseous ox­
ides with low boiling points (e.g. As2O3 or As4O6), which are easily 
emitted to the atmosphere with the flue gas, while As(V) exists mainly as 
arsenates with higher melting and boiling points, which eventually 
remain mostly in the fly ash [19,49]. As shown in Fig. 2, with the 
exception of F5, the largest proportion is arsenic in the reducible fraction 
(F3, averaging about 30.95%), with a relatively small proportion in 
other forms. The very small amount of soluble arsenate with arsenic 
oxide will be absorbed in the first two extraction steps. Whereas the 
main component of arsenic in F3 is an iron-manganese compound, Fu, 
et al. [50] found that iron oxide during incineration can trap large 
amounts of arsenic onto the fly ash surface to form Fe(III)-As(V) com­
pounds. Comparing Fig. 1, it can be seen that the higher Fe and Mn 
content in the fly ash leads to a higher percentage of its F3 form of 
arsenic, thus being the main reason for its higher effective fraction. 
Arsenic sulphides are mainly present in the oxidizable fraction (F4) [51]. 
Variation in the proportion of the arsenic residue state also contributes 
to the variation in its effective fraction. The main component of F5 is 
arsenate dominated by Ca3(AsO4)2, and some possible interactions of As 
with calcium-containing compounds were identified in studies by Shah, 
et al. [52] and Bartoˇnov´a, et al. [53], as shown in Eqs. (5) and (6). By 
comparison with Fig. 1, F5 also largely matches the positive correlation 
pattern with Ca content. 
As2O3 + 3CaO + O2 →Ca3(AsO4)2
(5)  
2As4O6 + 6CaO + 2O2 →2Ca3(AsO4)2
(6) 
As shown in Fig. 3, the average effective fraction of Se is the median 
of the 13 elements at 52.01%. Se is mainly present in fly ash as tetra­
valent selenium Se(IV), accompanied by small amounts of Se0 and 
hexavalent selenium (VI) [54]. This is mainly due to the stable nature of 
Se(IV), which is difficult to be oxidized to a higher valence state by re­
action with oxygen during waste incineration. Even if Se(VI) is gener­
ated during incineration, it is not stable for a long period of time and is 
easily reduced to a lower valence state by reacting with other substances 
in the fly ash capture and deposition process, therefore most of the se­
lenium in fly ash exists in the form of tetravalent selenium Se(IV) [55]. 
As shown in Fig. 2, a significant proportion of Se is absorbed by the first 
two leaching agents (F1 + F2 about 11.97%). This is because SeO2(s) 
and CaSeO3 can be soluble in water or acid. More Se is present in the

redox fractions, about 40.04% in F3 + F4 and up to 30.27% in the 
reducible fraction F3. Both Se fractions are predominantly in the Fe/Al 
combined state, with F3 being much larger than F4 indicating that the 
amorphous Fe/Al combined state has a higher Se content than the stable 
Fe/Al combined state. The reducing agent hydroxylamine hydrochloride 
can react with the insoluble CaSeO4 to convert it to soluble selenite, 
which further increases the proportion of F3, and the reaction equation 
is shown in Eq. (7). A significant proportion of selenium is also present in 
the residual state (43.52% to 52.77%), which is stably immobilized in 
the silicoaluminate.

As can be seen from Fig. 3, Pb accounts for the majority of the 
effective fraction, approximately 69.74%, ranking third among all 13 
trace elements. The possible forms of Pb in fly ash are diverse, mainly in 
the form of lead oxides (e.g. PbO, Pb2O3) or lead-containing salts (e.g. Pb 
(OH)2, PbCl2, PbCO3, PbSO4 and Pb(NO3)2) and in the combined form of 
Pb and Si [3]. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the water-soluble state of Pb (F1) 
accounts for a large proportion, approximately 26.02%. This part of Pb 
is extremely easy to release and will pose a great threat to the envi­
ronment. This part of Pb is mainly composed of part of the lead oxide 
dissolved in water and Pb(NO3)2. MSWI fly ash is generally alkaline in its 
aqueous solution due to the high content of Ca2+, Na+, K+ and OH−ions 
[4]. Given that Pb is an amphoteric metal, Pb(OH)2 and PbSO4 will 
gradually dissolve into Pb(OH) -
3 , Pb(OH)2 -
4 
and Pb(OH)2SO2 -
4
, 
increasing the solubility of Pb in water [56]. During the second 
extraction step, the pH of the solution will be altered so that the portion 
of Pb bound to the carbonate bond is absorbed. The Pb in the reducible 
fraction (F3) is a moderate component, accounting for approximately 
11.79%. Most of the Pb in this fraction is in the form of PbO2. The 
oxidizable Pb accounted for a large proportion (up to 30.46%) of the 
samples in this experiment and PbS is generally considered to be the 
dominant species [57]. The most stable form of Pb in the residual 
fraction is probably in the form of lead silicate glass (PbO•nSiO2) or 
silicoaluminate (PbO•Al2O3•2SiO2), obtained by the reaction of PbCl2 at 
high temperature in the form of Eq. (8) [58]. 
PbCl2 + Al2O3 ⋅2SiO2 + H2O →PbO ⋅Al2O3 ⋅2SiO2 + 2HCl
(8) 
Cd has the highest effective fraction of the 13 trace elements, at 
97.16%, and in combination with its high total content, it poses an 
extremely serious hazard to the surrounding environment. Cd is 
commonly found in MSWI fly ash in the chemical forms CdO or Cd(OH)2, 
CdCl2, CdCO3, CdSiO3 and CdSO4. It is evident that the acid-soluble 
fraction (F2) has the majority of Cd, approximately 77.64%. Most of 
the Cd is dissolved and absorbed in weak acids, particularly CdCl2, and 
the presence of Cl may enhance the activity of Cd [59]. However, CdCl2 
itself is readily soluble in water and the water-soluble fraction (F1) 
contains very little Cd (approximately 0.65%). This may also be due to 
the alkaline nature of the aqueous solution of MSWI fly ash, resulting in 
reduced solubility. In an alkaline environment, Cd3(PO4)2 and CdCO3 in 
fly ash tend to play an important role in the dissolution of Cd [60]. Cd in 
the redox fractions is mainly in the form of Fe–Mn oxides, accounting for 
approximately 11.56% of the total [10,61]. Unlike Cl, Si and Al inhibit 
the volatility of Cd. The oxides of Cd combine with the lattices of SiO2 
and Al2O3 to form a variety of stable compounds that may be the pre­
dominant form of residual Cd [59]. 
Cr has the lowest effective fraction of all Class I elements, and even of 
the 13 trace elements discussed throughout the study, at 22.25%. Cr in 
MSWI fly ash is mainly in the form of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). During waste 
incineration, Cr first escapes as Cr2O3(g), but subsequently CaO can be 
converted to CaCrO4 by reaction with Cr2O3(g). As shown in Eq. (9), 
resulting in a low percentage of Cr(III) in the fly ash [62]. CrO2 -
4 
is more 
readily leached than Cr(III) in the pH range of 6–11 and this fraction will 
be absorbed in the first two stages of the BCR sequential extraction 
method (approximately 5.81% of F1 + F2) [63]. During heat treatment, 
insoluble Cr(III) may be oxidized to soluble Cr(VI) at elevated temper­
atures, which may lead to elevated leaching concentrations in the redox 
state [64]. The residual fraction of Cr is overwhelming, reaching 
77.75%. This fraction of Cr is likely to be dissolved in glassy materials or 
to associate with easily evaporated organic or sulphide compounds to 
form stable compounds [65]. 
2Cr2O3(s) + 4CaO(s) + 3O2 →4CaCrO4(s)
(9)  
3.4. Forms of Class II elements 
Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn belong to the typical Class II elements, they are 
common in nature but can still pose a threat to human health. As shown 
in Fig. 3, except for Ni (37.22%), the effective fractions of the other three 
trace elements exceeded 50% (53.60%-68.88%). 
As shown in Fig. 3, the effective fraction of Mn exceeds 50%, 
reaching 53.60%. However, as observed in Fig. 2, it is known that most 
of the Mn in MSWI fly ash is present in the redox fraction (F3 + F4 up to 
49.10%), while the Mn content in F1 + F2 is very small. Specifically, 
most of the manganese in the water-soluble fraction and acid-soluble 
fraction was soluble manganese salt, i.e., divalent manganese Mn(II). 
The phenomenon that Mn was only soluble in acetate buffer and almost 
no soluble fraction was detected in deionized water also coincided with 
the study of Li, et al. [66]. This part of Mn(II) may exist in the form of 
MnCl2, MnSO4, etc., and is obtained from the reaction of MnO2 with 
acidic gas during the incineration process, with possible chemical 
equations expressed in the following Eqs. (10)–(11). In addition to 
divalent manganese, the common valences of manganese include Mn 
(IV) and Mn(VII), which exist in the form of oxides, permanganate 
(MnO4−) and Fe–Mn compounds. The variability of Fe and Mn valences 
results in a higher content of Mn in the redox state. Tetravalent man­
ganese Mn(IV) can also be used as the central ion of the complex to form 
a stable complex, which is one of the reasons for the high Mn content in 
the residue fraction. 
MnO2 + 4HCl →MnCl2 + Cl2 + 2H2O
(10)  
2MnO2 + 2SO3 + 2H2O →2MnSO4 + O2 + 2H2O
(11) 
As shown in Fig. 3, the effective fraction of Ni is the lowest of all Class 
II elements, at around 37.22%. However, referring to Fig. 2, it can be 
seen that a large proportion of Ni is still present in the acid soluble 
fraction (about 16.59% of F2), which can easily be released into the 
environment to cause harm. Xin, et al. [13] pointed out that the leaching 
behaviour of Ni in fly ash has received little attention because the 
leaching rate of Ni from fly ash in conventional coal-fired power plants is 
not high. However, the enrichment of Cl-, SO2 -
4 
and NO3– during waste 
incineration elevates the content of NI(II)-containing Ni salts thereby 
leading to an elevated Ni content in the water-soluble and acid-soluble 
fractions. Except for NI(II), the stable valence state of nickel is only NI 
(III), which is mostly found in Ni2O3 and Ni(OH)3. However, during 
waste incineration, NI(III) is prone to react with HCl as shown in Eqs. 
(12)–(13), leading to a reduction in NI(III) content and consequently in 
the redox fraction of Ni. Because Ni is ferromagnetic, it is easily 
immobilized by combining with Fe–Mn oxides to form more complex 
compounds. Most of the Ni in the residue fraction is in the form of Fe–Mn 
oxides and sulphides or silicates [10].

(12)  
2Ni(OH)3 + 6HCl →2NiCl2 + Cl2 + 6H2O
(13) 
Cu was the element with the highest effective fraction of Class II 
elements, reaching 68.88%. As shown in Fig. 2, the effective fractions of 
Cu are evenly distributed among F2, F3 and F4, accounting for 
approximately 22.78%, 19.04% and 26.59% respectively. The main 
valence states of Cu are Cu(I) and Cu(II), and the complex environment

Fuel 346 (2023) 128374

during waste incineration forms various oxides and chlorides of Cu, as 
shown in Eqs. (13)–(14), the solubility of the latter being the main 
reason for the high percentage of F2. The other part may consist of acid- 
soluble carbonate species. CaClOH and Ca(OH)2 in the fly ash react with 
CO2 and combine with copper ions to convert to trace element carbon­
ates such as CuCO3 and Cu2(OH)2CO3 [67]. The abundance of various 
elemental valencies in copper sulphides, oxides and compounds formed 
in combination with iron and manganese oxides allows for a variety of 
reactions to occur under redox conditions to produce soluble copper 
salts that can be leached. In addition, the high affinity of Cu for organic 
complexation further increases the fraction of oxidizable fractions [22]. 
Cu in the residual fraction is mainly present as Cu3(PO4)2, sulphides and 
immobilized in silicate groups [68]. 
2Cu + O2 →2CuO ; 2Cu + O2 + 4HCl →2CuCl2 + 2H2O
(14)  
4Cu + O2 →2Cu2O ; 4Cu + O2 + 4HCl →4CuCl + 2H2O
(15) 
As shown in Fig. 3, the effective fraction of Zn also exceeds 60%, 
reaching 62.26%. In Fig. 3, it can be seen that Zn is very similar to Cu 
with a more even distribution of F2, F3 and F4. However, the acid sol­
uble fraction of Zn is higher at 25.71%; the other two fractions also reach 
17.74% and 18.03% respectively. Zn in MSWI fly ash is mainly 
composed of oxides, chlorides, sulphides and some salts. Similar to 
copper, Zn can undergo reactions such as Eq. (14) to form the corre­
sponding oxides and chlorides, which become the main components of 
F2. The only common valence state of Zn is Zn(II), but the redox state 
still accounts for a large proportion of the Zn content. This is mainly due 
to the combination of Zn with Fe–Mn oxides [10,61], as shown in Eq. 
(16). The variable nature of the Fe and Mn chemical valences resulted in 
some of the Zn being leached in a redox environment. The residual 
fraction (F5) had a Zn fraction of approximately 37.74%. This can be 
explained by the fact that under the high temperature oxidizing atmo­
sphere of the incineration process, Zn readily combines with Al2O3 and 
SiO2 in the ash to form zinc orthosilicate (Zn2SiO4) and zinc spinel 
(ZnAl2O4), which are immobilized in the silicoaluminate lattice. 
ZnCl2 + FeO + H2O →Fe[ZnCl2(OH) ]2
(16)  
3.5. Forms of Class III elements 
Ba, Co and Sb are Class III elements, which are less toxic than the 
previous two classes. As can be seen from Fig. 3, the effective fractions of 
these three trace elements are all relatively low, less than 50%. The 
effective fraction of Ba is the highest, about 40.98%, while the effective 
fractions of Co and Sb are 35.49% and 27.84% respectively. 
Ba is the most reactive of the alkaline earth metals and its effective 
fraction is even higher than that of some Class I and Class II elements. As 
observed in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the oxidizable fraction (F4) and the 
water-soluble fraction (F1) of Ba account for a relatively large propor­
tion of the effective fraction, 29.62% and 6.61% respectively. Similar to 
the same main group element Ca, Ba may be present in fly ash as oxides, 
hydroxides, chlorides, carbonates and in combination with other metal 
oxides. Barium chloride is readily soluble in water and constitutes the 
vast majority of F1. Chemically stable BaSO4 with Ba fixed in silica- 
aluminates is the main component of the residue fraction (approxi­
mately 59.02% of F5). As shown in Fig. 2, Co and Sb behaved similarly in 
the BCR sequential extraction experiment, with F2, F3 and F4 occupying 
the majority of the fraction other than the residual fraction. Co is similar 
to Fe and Ni in terms of chemical behaviour, with two common valence 
states, Co(II) and Co(III). As for Sb, it is in the same main group as As and 
has similar chemical properties, with two common valence states, Sb(III) 
and Sb(V). Soluble chlorides of Co and Sb (CoCl2, SbCl3) are the main 
components of the acid-soluble fraction, while complex compounds 
formed in combination with Fe–Mn oxides are the main components of 
the redox fractions. For the residual fractions of Co and Sb (approxi­
mately 64.06% and 72.16%, respectively), which may be immobilized in 
silicoaluminates or in the form of Ca3(SbO4)2 and sulphides [69], they 
have good stability and low biological activity in the environment. 
3.6. Characterization of MSWI fly ash 
The surface mineral crystal phase composition of the MSWI fly ash 
over the seven days was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 
the results are shown in Fig. 4. The results indicate that calcium and 
chloride salts are the main components of the waste incineration fly ash, 
with a portion present in the form of silica oxides, and the characteristic 
peak of SiO2 can be clearly seen in Fig. 4. This result is the same as the 
previous major element and typical anion measurements. Specifically, 
calcium salts are mainly present in the crystalline phase as Ca(OH)2, 
CaCO3, CaClOH and CaSO4. Municipal waste incineration produces 
large amounts of acidic gases, which are typically neutralized using 
limestone (CaCO3). CaCO3 decomposes to CaO and CO2 at high tem­
peratures, and CaO then reacts with water vapour and acidic gases to 
form various calcium salts, as shown in Eqs. (17)–(20). Chlorine salts are 
mainly present as NaCl, CaClOH and SiCl4 and the vast majority of them 
are soluble in water. Large amounts of chloride salts are generally 
attributed to the large amount of organic and kitchen waste in municipal

The typical BET test results for the sample fly ash are shown in detail 
in Fig. S1 of the supporting material. Based on the BET test results, the 
average surface area of MSWI fly ash is 24.947 m2/g, the total pore 
volume is approximately 0.0266 m3/g and the average pore size is 5.88 
nm. The particle size distribution of the MSWI fly ash at each date of this 
test was generally consistent, ranging from approximately 0.1um to 
100um, with an average particle size (median particle size) of approx­
imately 10 µm.The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the MSWI fly 
ash samples were all Type IV according to the BET test results, indicating 
that the fly ash is predominantly mesoporous in structure which is more 
conducive to the transport of reactants or solvents. A large specific 
surface area can exhibit a greater abundance of reaction sites, providing 
storage sites for contaminants. And the well-developed pore structure

will further facilitate the diffuse transport of contaminants on MSWI fly 
ash particles [71].The smaller particle size distribution and mesoporous 
structure makes it easier for MSWI fly ash to participate in the soil 
ecological cycle or water cycle when discharged into the environment, 
and to have an impact on the surrounding environment [72].

3.7. Risk assessment 
3.7.1. RAC analysis for environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment based on the Risk Assessment 
Code (RAC) made for the MSWI fly ash samples in this study is shown in 
Fig. 5 below. As can be seen from Fig. 5(a), in general, these 13 trace 
elements in MSWI fly ash are more or less hazardous to the surrounding 
environment. The As, Cr, Mn and Ba pairs constitute a low risk level, 
with As having the lowest average risk level and As in FA-6 not even 
posing a risk to the environment. The effective fractions for Mn and Ba 
are quite high, but the reason they are still low risk is that they have a 
greater proportion of redox fractions. And the risk levels for Mn and Ba 
fluctuate considerably, with Mn being in the no, low and medium risk 
classes. This suggests that studying only one day of MSWI fly ash does 
not give a general overview of all situations. The elements with the 
average risk level reaching the medium risk are the most numerous, they 
are Hg, Se, Pb, Ni, Cu, Zn, Co and Sb. However, as can be seen from Fig. 5 
(b-h), Hg and Pb have several days with risk levels even reaching high 
risk levels. This part of the data will complement the average data and 
serve as a good reference when it comes to waste treatment. A relatively 
objective scientific evaluation of the hazards of MSWI fly ash can only be 
made by considering the risk rating of consecutive week samples in an 
integrated manner. The trace element with the highest risk level is Cd, 
with a RAC value of over 50% for each day, reaching very high risk. The 
average risk ranking of the 13 elements obtained by the RAC method is: 
As < Mn < Cr < Ba < Se < Co < Sb < Ni < Cu < Hg < Zn < Pb < Cd. 
Although the RAC method does not consider the total content as an 
important factor in the analysis process, the total amount of fly ash 
produced by municipal waste incineration plants is so large that a large 
proportion of leachable trace elements will enter the biological cycle 
through the soil or water cycle, putting the health of nearby residents at 
risk. 
3.7.2. Nemerow pollution index method for environmental risk assessment 
In order to evaluate the risk of MSWI fly ash from multiple per­
spectives and more comprehensively, this study also evaluated the risk 
level of each trace element contaminant in the fly ash and the fly ash as a 
whole using the Nemerow Pollution Index method. The single pollution 
index (Pi) of each trace element in MSWI fly ash and its comprehensive 
contamination index (PZ) are shown in Fig. 6. Compared to the RAC 
method, the Nemerow Pollution Index focuses more on the mass content 
of pollutants rather than the percentage share. Therefore, there is a 
significant portion of trace element with a risk level of “Safety” within 
seven days, including Class I elements As, Pb and Cr, Class II elements 
Mn and Ni, Class III elements Ba and Co. Se also showed no risk except 
for two days with a “Precaution” risk rating. Some of these elements 
have low risk levels due to their low concentrations, such as As, Se, Cr, 
Ni and Co. For other trace elements, it is due to a relatively high envi­
ronmental tolerance, i.e. a higher Soil Environmental Quality Standard 
(SI) value, making them a relatively low environmental risk despite their 
high concentrations. The trace elements with a higher risk level are Cu 
and Zn, with Zn even reaching “Slightly polluted” in every daily sample. 
This is mainly due to the high total content of Cu and Zn and the large 
proportion of F1 + F2 in the effective fraction, but the risk level is not as 
high due to the equally large SI values. The risk levels for Hg varied 
considerably over the seven-day period, from “Slightly polluted” to 
“Seriously polluted”, and were inextricably linked to changes in the total 
elemental Hg content. The most serious pollutants are Cd and Sb, all of 
which have a single pollution index (Pi) that significantly exceeds the 
minimum standard of “Seriously polluted”. The reason why the total Cd 
content is not too high but the risk is so high is the exaggerated per­
centage of F1 + F2 in its effective fraction. The highest risk for Sb is 
mainly due to the fact that its SI value is the lowest of the 13 trace el­
ements, at 0.27 mg/kg. 
The comprehensive contamination index (PZ) takes full account of 
the weighted average and maximum values of the individual pollution 
indices and considers all pollution indicators together. As the results in 
Fig. 6 show, all MSWI fly ash samples within seven days had a risk level 
of “Seriously polluted”. This indicates that, taken together, MSWI fly ash 
poses a considerable risk to the surrounding environment and ecological 
safety if it is disposed of in landfill directly without proper disposal. 
In summary, the unique source and generation of MSWI fly ash re­
sults in a higher trace element content and environmental leaching risk 
than typical solid waste. However, the current treatment methods for 
them are quite limited, and it is recommended to borrow methods from 
the solid waste solidification/stabilization of trace elements in coal-fired 
power plants to provide targeted treatment of MSWI fly ash prior to its 
discharge. For example, the use of curing agents to solidify the trace 
elements in them, or the use of methods such as accelerated carbonation 
to stabilize the trace elements within the fly ash and control their 
leaching concentration. 
4. Conclusions 
This paper firstly focused on the total contents and chemical forms of 
13 trace elements (Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ba, Co and Sb) 
in MSWI fly ash samples from a typical waste incineration power plant in 
China within one week. The average concentrations of Se and Hg were 
the lowest at 2.75 μg/g and 12.59 μg/g respectively; the highest trace 
elements were Ba and Zn with average concentrations of 1076.21 μg/g 
and 2009.43 μg/g respectively. The enrichment of elemental Cl led to an 
increase in the proportion of leachable fraction of each trace element. 
The element with the highest effective fraction share was Cd, up to 
97.16%; the element with the lowest effective fraction was Cr, but also 
with a 22.25% share. This indicated that all hazardous trace elements in 
MSWI fly ash exhibit a high environmental migration capacity. The 
redox fraction (F3 + F4) accounts for the majority of the elements except 
for the residual fraction (F5). The water-soluble fraction (F1) is more 
pronounced in Pb, Hg and Ba, while the proportion of acid-soluble 
fractions (F2) in the other ten trace elements is more prominent, espe­
cially in Cd, which reaches an alarming 77.64%. 
It is clear that the leaching of trace elements from MSWI fly ash will 
pose a risk to the surrounding environment. In order to visualize and 
make this risk more explicit, this study evaluated the risk of each trace 
element in MSWI fly ash against the combined risk using the RAC 
method and the Nemerow Pollution Index method. The average risk 
ranking of the 13 elements obtained by the RAC method is: As < Mn <
Cr < Ba < Se < Co < Sb < Ni < Cu < Hg < Zn < Pb < Cd, and all trace 
elements pose a risk to the environment. According to the Nemerow 
Pollution Index analysis, although seven trace elements such as As, Pb,

Cr, Mn, Ni, Ba and Co do not pose any risk to the environment, the 
combined pollution risk of MSWI fly ash per day is “Seriously polluted” 
due to the high risk level of the other trace elements. Therefore, it is 
recommended to reduce the risk of leaching of hazardous trace elements 
from MSWI fly ash to the environment by methods such as stabilization 
with solidifying agents or accelerated carbonation prior to discharge.

Abstract: Southeast Asia (SEA) is a hotspot region for atmospheric pollution and haze conditions, due
to extensive forest, agricultural and peat ﬁres. This study aims to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations
across Malaysia using machine-learning (ML) models like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector
Regression (SVR), based on satellite AOD (aerosol optical depth) observations, ground measured air
pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, O3) and meteorological parameters (air temperature, relative humidity,
wind speed and direction). The estimated PM2.5 concentrations for a two-year period (2018–2019)
are evaluated against measurements performed at 65 air-quality monitoring stations located at
urban, industrial, suburban and rural sites. PM2.5 concentrations varied widely between the stations,
with higher values (mean of 24.2 ± 21.6 µg m−3) at urban/industrial stations and lower (mean
of 21.3 ± 18.4 µg m−3) at suburban/rural sites. Furthermore, pronounced seasonal variability
in PM2.5 is recorded across Malaysia, with highest concentrations during the dry season (June–
September). Seven models were developed for PM2.5 predictions, i.e., separately for urban/industrial
and suburban/rural sites, for the four dominant seasons (dry, wet and two inter-monsoon), and an
overall model, which displayed accuracies in the order of R2 = 0.46–0.76. The validation analysis
reveals that the RF model (R2 = 0.53–0.76) exhibits slightly better performance than SVR, except for
the overall model. This is the ﬁrst study conducted in Malaysia for PM2.5 estimations at a national
scale combining satellite aerosol retrievals with ground-based pollutants, meteorological factors
and ML techniques. The satisfactory prediction of PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia allows a
continuous monitoring of the pollution levels at remote areas with absence of measurement networks.

1. Introduction
Air pollution has become an acute environmental and health issue in developing coun-
tries during the last decades due to intense industrialization and urbanization processes [1–3].
It is estimated that about 7 million people die every year worldwide because of exposure to
fine particulate pollution < 2.5 µm (PM2.5), while about 91% of the world’s population live
in areas with PM2.5 concentrations above the allowable limits of 10–20 µg m−3 [4]. South-
east Asia (SEA) is not an exception to high pollution levels and experiences persistent haze
conditions, especially during the dry season (June to September) due to extensive forest,
agricultural and peat fires [5–9]. Malaysia is located in the main pathway of the SEA pollution

outflow [10] that escalates the pollution levels due to trans-boundary aerosol transport. Air
quality in Malaysia is considered rather degraded, as the annual mean PM2.5 concentration is
about 20 µg m−3 in 2019 [11], thus exceeding the limit set by WHO. Local sources such as
traffic and industrial emissions, as well as biomass burning significantly contribute to the local
pollution and aerosol loading [12–14]. According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia [15],
chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD) is the fifth leading cause of death in Malaysia that
was increased from 2.0% to 2.6% between the years 2017 and 2018. In fact, chronic exposure
to PM2.5 has significant impacts on human health by causing asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, cardiovascular and neurotoxic effects [16,17]. Therefore,
continuous monitoring of the levels and mapping of spatial distribution of PM2.5 is especially
important for taking appropriate actions to maintain a good air quality over Malaysia [18,19].
Nowadays, many satellites provide reliable AOD (aerosol optical depth) products
that can be used through various techniques for PM estimations from space, such as the
Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) [20,21], Multiangle Imaging Spectro-
radiometer (MISR) [22], Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) [23], Spinning
Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) [24] and Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) [25–28]. Among the satellite data products, AOD provided
by MODIS sensor on board Terra and Aqua satellites has been widely used for many
applications due to its high retrieval accuracy over land and near daily global coverage at
10 km and 3 km spatial resolution [26,27,29]. However, its usability in SEA is still limited
due to large missing data series as a result of heavy and extended cloudiness [18,30–32].
On the other hand, geostationary satellites provide high temporal resolution (~15 min)
data, thus limiting the problem of cloudiness. In the past few years, geostationary satellites
such as Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) [33], Geostationary
Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) [34], Fengyun-4 [35] and Himawari-8 [36–38] are available
and provide continuous data over the SEA region.
Signiﬁcant progress has been made in developing and establishing various techniques
for estimating PM concentrations from space at local, regional and global scales. The
progress in usage of linear and multi-linear statistics, regression-based, machine learn-
ing and hybrid models for estimations of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during the last
decades is reviewed in recent works [1,39,40]. In the early 2000s, most researchers pre-
dicted PM using only AOD, by means of simple linear regression techniques [41,42]. Later
on, more advanced techniques were developed to incorporate AOD and other important
parameters that may inﬂuence PM distribution spatially and temporarily, starting from mul-
tiple linear regressions [18,43–46], chemical transport models (CTM) [47–50], mixed effect
models (MEM) [51–54], artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) [18,55–58], geographic weighted
regression (GWR) [59–62] and generalized additive models (GAM) [63–66]. These tech-
niques were used to capture the non-linear relationships that exist between the variables.
Consequently, complex techniques have been developed by combining two or more sta-
tistical techniques; for instance, merging MEM and GWR [67] or incorporating MEM into
GAM [68]. Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as deep neural network
(DNN), support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) enable to capture the
complex relationships between parameters, exhibiting greater performance in estimating
PM2.5 [69,70] and are increasingly used in air quality studies [71–74]. Furthermore, some
studies have incorporated meteorological factors with land use variables to predict the
spatial and temporal variation of aeolian erosion and PM [75–79]. However, only few
studies have incorporated air pollutant concentrations for PM2.5 estimations [65,80,81].
Song et al. [65] explored the use of generalized additive model to estimate PM2.5 concentra-
tions in the Xi’an City, China (3581 square kilometres) using a combination of air pollutants
(SO2, CO, NO2, and O3), AOD and meteorological variables. The model was found to
explain ~70% of the variance in PM2.5 concentrations, with CO concentration and AOD
represented most of the variation. The inﬂuence of air pollutants on the seasonal variability
of PM2.5 in an urban-industrial environment in Malaysia was investigated by [81] for one
year. This study concluded that only gases (CO, NO2, NO and SO2) signiﬁcantly affected

the PM2.5 mass, but not the meteorological factors (rainfall, wind speed and wind direction).
Based on the prediction model of [80], temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI), humidity and residential area were found to be important parameters affect-
ing the spatial variation of PM2.5 in Jakarta, Indonesia. The same study [80], also showed
that several parameters (PM10, NO2, SO2, UV, rainfall, land use and NDVI) inﬂuenced the
distribution of PM2.5 in Taipei, Taiwan. More studies are therefore needed to ﬁnd out the
role of gases and meteorology in affecting the spatial and seasonal patterns of PM2.5, even
using meteorological normalization techniques in order to exclude the effect of changing
meteorology on PM concentrations trends [82]. Recently, ML approaches (random forest
regression models) were implemented to predict the large reductions in air pollutants, i.e.,
PM10, NO2, O3, during the COVID-19 lockdown period [83]. Furthermore, PM10, NO2 and
carbonaceous aerosols (organic carbon, elemental carbon) were also used in ML techniques
(Lasso, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine and Partials Least squares)
for analysing air pollutants at street canyons [84]. Studies dealing with PM estimations in
Malaysia are rather limited [18,30]. Shaziayani et al. [85] has reviewed PM10 modelling
studies in Malaysia, and only four studies used ML techniques in predicting PM10. On
the other hand, PM2.5 studies are even fewer and most of them in Malaysia have been
performed at small spatial scales [86,87].
The current study is the ﬁrst in Malaysia and one of the very few works conducted
worldwide aiming to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations at a large (national) scale using
pollution gases, AOD and meteorological factors based on machine-learning techniques.
In order to extend the spatial coverage to the whole country (both Peninsular and Island
Malaysia) and aiming to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 estimates, this study integrates
hourly AOD products from Himawari-8 satellite sensor, along with meteorological pa-
rameters and gaseous pollutants using machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest
(RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The models were developed separately for
urban/industrial, suburban/rural sites and for the four dominant seasons in order to
better represent the spatial (between sites) and temporal (between seasons) variation of the
PM2.5 concentrations. Variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the primary
parameters that affect the PM2.5 concentrations in Malaysia in a way to develop regression
models for estimations of PM2.5. The performance of RF and SVR was evaluated at different
seasons and locations against measured PM2.5 concentrations. The results will assist in
representing the spatial and temporal evolution of PM2.5 in Malaysia and for establishing
measures in a way to improve air quality across the country.
Section 2 brieﬂy describes the study area; Section 3 refers to the dataset that was used
as variables in the prediction models; Section 4 refers to the PM2.5 measurements across
Malaysia. The results and model evaluation are included in Section 5, while Section 6
summarises the conclusions.
2. Study Area
Malaysia is one of the developed countries in SEA region with a rapid urbanization
rate since 1970 [88]. Consequently, air pollution has become one of the serious envi-
ronmental and human health concerns across the country [5,89], particularly in urban,
industrialised and congested trafﬁc areas such as Klang Valley (in the west coast of Penin-
sular Malaysia), Johor Bahru (southern tip of the Peninsula) and Georgetown, Penang
(north of Peninsula) [90,91]. Air quality deteriorates at several parts of Peninsular Malaysia
and in Borneo Island during the dry season mainly due to trans-boundary haze from
neighbouring countries and regional/local forest ﬁres. The concentrations of aerosols and
air pollutants display a distinct seasonality, inﬂuenced by local meteorological conditions,
i.e., rainfall, wind speed, relative humidity (RH) and temperature [86], being lower during
the monsoon rainy season (November–March). In this study, 65 air quality monitoring
stations (Figure 1) distributed across the Peninsular and Island Malaysia (Labuan, Sabah
and Sarawak) were used to analyse the air pollution levels (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and O3
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326
4 of 24
concentrations). The stations are representative of industrial (7 stations), urban (10 stations),
suburban (36 stations) and rural (12 stations) areas.
Figure 1. Locations of the 65 air quality monitoring stations across Malaysia.
3. Dataset
The dataset used in this study consist of PM2.5 and air pollutant concentrations,
along with meteorological parameters from ground stations, as well as AOD data from
Himawari-8 satellite.
3.1. Ground Measurements
PM2.5 concentrations in Malaysia have been measured since April 2017. The Depart-
ment of Environment, Malaysia (DOE) increased the number of air quality monitoring
stations across the country from 52 to 65 stations in 2017 (Figure 1). Furthermore, these
stations also measure meteorological parameters (e.g., ambient temperature, TEMP; RH,
wind speed, WS; wind direction, WD) and gaseous pollutants (e.g., nitrogen dioxide,
NO2; carbon monoxide, CO; sulphur dioxide, SO2; ozone, O3). The stations are strate-
gically distributed to represent urban, industrial, suburban and rural areas [92]. PM2.5
measurements were performed via the TEOM 1405DF, which is a continuous dichotomous
ambient air monitoring system with two Filter Dynamics Measurements Systems [93], able
to measure PM2.5 and PM10. SO2, NO2, CO and O3 are measured using Thermo Scientiﬁc
model 43i, model 42i, model 48i and model 49i, respectively [93,94]. RH and TEMP were
recorded using a Climatronic AIO 2 Weather Sensor (Climatronic Corporation) [95]. All
the ground data were obtained on an hourly basis covering the period from January 2018
to December 2019.
All air quality and meteorological measurements went through quality assurance
and quality control (QA/QC) procedures. Instruments for the detection of gases were
manually calibrated once a fortnight. Flow veriﬁcation for PM10 and PM2.5 measurements
using TEOM was conducted once a month. The data removal during the QC check was
predominantly due to insufﬁcient measurements and instrument failure, while some
perturbed data were also excluded as outliers in a second-level QC check [95].
3.2. Satellite Data
Himawari-8 is a geostationary satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
It was launched on 7 October 2014 and carries the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI)
sensor, which is equipped with 16 bands from visible to infrared [36]. Himawari-8 releases
AOD products at two levels, namely Level 2 (10 min temporal) and Level 3 (hourly and
daily), which have been used for various applications including estimation of PM [96–99],
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326

dust detection [100] and aerosol data assimilation [101]. The L3 product is an improved
version of the L2 AOD product that minimized cloud contamination [102] and has a 5 km
spatial resolution. Himawari-8 AOD at 500 nm is associated with quality assurance levels
namely “very good”, “good”, “marginal” and “no conﬁdent (or no retrieval)” [99]. In this
study, only the “very good” L3 AOD500 retrievals were considered for PM2.5 estimations,
downloaded from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) website: available
online: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ptree/index.html (accessed on 10 May 2021) for the
period January 2018–December 2019. Recently, Himawari-8 AODs were used to estimate
the PM2.5 concentrations over Hubei province, China [103]. Application of the Himawari-8
L2 AOD data over Malaysia revealed an overestimation by 24.2% [104], while the L3 AOD
products displayed a better agreement with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)
AODs with a coefﬁcient of determination R2 = 0.81, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.13
and an overall overestimation of only 1% [92]. Moreover, Himawari-8 AODs presented a
good agreement with AERONET AODs in China (R2 = 0.41–0.83; RMSE = 0.18–0.31) [105],
Southeast Asia (R2 = 0.64; RMSE = 0.28), East Asia (R2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.14) [106], Korea
(R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 0.19) and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (R2 = 0.76; RMSE = 0.36) [107].
4. PM2.5 Estimation
The overall methodology used for the PM2.5 estimations over Malaysia is illustrated in
Figure 2. The model inputs consist of hourly AOD, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, WS, WD, TEMP and
RH values. Hourly AOD data from Himawari-8 were extracted at 5 × 5 km over the air
quality monitoring stations and temporally collocated with ground measurements. Wind
direction was used in the model because wind blowing from a highly polluted area can
inﬂuence air quality in other downwind places. Wind speed enables to accelerate pollutants
travelling from other places but also contributes to the dilution processes at local level [108].
On the other hand, temperature can trigger biogenic emissions, photochemical reactions
and secondary aerosol formation over the region [109] and also control the temperature
inversions, which can trap the pollutants near the surface [45,108,110]. Finally, RH may
affect the hygroscopic growth of particles and enhance the aerosol scattering [111–113].
Figure 2. Flowchart of the overall dataset and methodology used for the estimations of PM2.5
concentrations.
In this study, we utilized and evaluated two ML models, namely, Support Vector
Regression (SVR) and Random Forest (RF) to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at the 65 air
quality monitoring stations across Malaysia. The input variables to the SVR and RF models
are selected based on our previous study [18,31] and other literature [114,115]. In total,
we developed 7 different models to represent the spatial and seasonal effects on PM2.5
distributions. Model 1 considers all data from the 65 stations, but other models, i.e., models
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326
6 of 24
2 and 3, only represent urban/industrial and suburban sites, respectively, while models 4 to
7 represent different seasons (wet, dry and two inter monsoon). The models are described
in the subsequent sections.
4.1. Machine Learning (ML) for PM2.5 Estimation
Nowadays, several studies have used machine learning (ML) techniques, including
RF model, aiming to increase the accuracy in prediction of PM concentrations, since these
models are ﬂexible in nonlinear approaches [72,116–119]. The SVR and RF techniques were
particularly selected in this study to achieve more accurate PM2.5 estimations using satellite-
derived AOD, meteorological parameters and gaseous pollutants as predictor variables.
The Classiﬁcation And REgression Training (CARET) package was used to perform the
RF and SVR modelling. The data splitting, pre-processing, model tuning and variable
importance analysis were executed in a R environment. SVR depends on the kernel function
and due to its excellent generalization capability, it is able to minimize the overﬁtting [120],
and therefore, it has been used for PM estimations [69,108,121]. SVR can ﬁt the errors
within a certain threshold by ﬁnding an appropriate boundary line (between hyperplane)
to suit the data. The ﬂexibility of SVR depends on the selection of the parameter such as
kernel function, cost function and epsilon value. There are four types of kernel functions
namely linear, polynomial, sigmoid and radial basis function (RBF) that were used in this
study for capturing the non-linear dynamics [69], whilst cost function was used to avoid
any overﬁtting of the data, as small cost value leads to large margin (or wide boundary
line) and causes overﬁtting in the model. The epsilon value controls the number of support
vectors used to develop the regression function, while the smaller epsilon value indicates
an optimum accuracy. Initially, the SVR parameters are selected based on trial-and-error
values, but we found that the default values (Supplementary Materials Table S1) included
in the R package “e1071” provided the most promising results.
Random Forest (RF) is a tree-based ML technique proposed by [122]. Theoretically,
RF model is an ensemble of multiple decision trees and uses the majority vote/decision of
the trees as the ﬁnal RF model [123,124]. The algorithm becomes more robust when more
decision trees are constructed. RF randomly selects parameters in order to develop each tree,
and therefore, it reﬂects potentially complex effects of predictors on the prediction [125].
The purpose of selecting random predictors instead of all predictors is to reduce the
correlation between trees in order to make them disparate [126]. Thus, the variance of the
RF prediction can reduce any overﬁttings. The number of decision trees can be modiﬁed to
reduce the training time according to a required accuracy and computing capability [127].
In this study, RF model was run using the “Random Forest” in the R package. Since, RF is a
non-parametric algorithm, here we only set the two most important parameters—although
RF can have more parameters—which are mtry and ntree. Parameter mtry is a number of
predictors sampled for splitting at each node while ntree is a number of trees in the forest.
If mtry value is too small, it might be none of signiﬁcant parameters included in the subset,
and the insigniﬁcant parameters would be selected for a split. Therefore, the trees have
poor predictive ability [126]. In this study, we set the mtry = 3 (as default: mtry = p/3,
where p is the number of parameters used in the model), while ntree is set as 500 in the
model. For tuning, we only tune mtry because the CARET package has automatic tuning
for mtry only. Therefore, in this study, for ntree, we used the default value [128,129]. The
results were obtained based on best mtry tuning accuracy. It should be mentioned that a
limitation of this study is that models were not broadly optimized.
4.2. Model Validation
The total number of the matching dataset, covering all parameters at the 65 stations in
Malaysia from 2018 to 2019, is 13,376. The matching data were randomly partitioned at a
fraction of 70% for model calibration (model development) and 30% for model validation.
In the model development, a sample based 10-fold cross validation technique was used,
where the calibration data were randomly divided into 10 subsets; at any single moment,
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326
7 of 24
one subset was used for validation and the remaining subsets were used for calibrating
the model. The average value of the results of the 10 subsets was adopted as the model
accuracy. The sample based 10 cross validation (CV) performed validation with matchup
sample from both spatial and temporal dimension. This is a commonly used CV-based
technique to reveal the overall predictive ability of PM2.5 estimation models [130]. Then,
the ﬁnal models were validated using the 30% of the remaining data. Statistical indicators
such as the coefﬁcient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean bias
error (MBE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efﬁciency (NSE) were used to evaluate the accuracy of
the models. The NSE is a normalized statistic, which can determine the magnitude of the
residual variance to the measured data variance and indicates how well the measured
PM2.5 versus estimated PM2.5 data ﬁts the 1:1 line (best ﬁt line).

indicates an ideal model performance, while NSE = 0 shows model predictions as accurate
as the mean of the observed data. Lower RMSE and MBE values correspond to better
performance and to lower biases from the ML models.
4.3. Variable Importance
Variable importance statistic was used to analyse the contribution of each variable in
PM2.5 estimations. Since SVR is a kernel-based model, and we do not know the concrete
form of its nonlinear mapping function, and the weight vector (ω) cannot be computed
directly [128], it is complicated to analyse the variables importance statistic. On the other
hand, there are two famous measures for RF, which are mean decrease accuracy (MDA)
and mean decrease Gini (MDG). The MDG is based on Gini importance which measures
the average gain by splits of a given variable, whilst MDA is based on out of bag (OOB)
samples. In RF model, each tree is grown based on a bootstrap sample of the training data,
and those data that were not used in the bootstrap sample are known as out of bag (OOB)
samples [126]. The MDA measures the accuracy of the model losses by permuting each
variable. This technique is considered as most efﬁcient variable importance for random
forest [129,131], and it was preferred in this study as less bias compared to Gini importance.
The higher percentage value of the variable importance indicates higher inﬂuence of the
corresponding variable to PM2.5 estimations. In R script, we used the “varImp” function,
which can automatically scale the importance scores in values between 0 and 100.
5. Results and Discussion
5.1. Descriptive Statistics
The descriptive statistics of the measured variables that are used in SVR and RF
models for all stations in Malaysia are summarized in Table 1. The columnar AOD500 over
the Malaysian sites during 2018–2019 exhibits a mean of 0.69, which is above the median
value 0.46 due to many episodic aerosol events with AODs above 2, representing thick
smoke plumes from extensive ﬁres in Indonesia and Indochina [10,132,133]. The measured
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326

PM2.5 concentrations at the 65 examined sites follow a similar distribution with a higher
mean (21.9 µg m−3) than median (17.1 µg m−3) and a maximum value of 230 µg m−3
(Table 1, Figure 3). These PM2.5 levels are similar to those reported at several sites in
Southeast Asia [86,134]. NO2 and CO exhibit means of 5.2 ppb and 0.6 ppm, respectively,
while tropospheric O3 levels (25.2 ppb) are considered rather high with deleterious effects
on human health [135,136].

ban/industrial and suburban/rural sites in Malaysia in the dry, wet and inter-monsoon seasons.
The box-whisker plots for AOD500 and air pollutants, separated for urban/industrial
and suburban/rural sites and for the four seasons, are shown in Figure 3. The analy-
sis showed that the seasonal-mean PM2.5 at the urban/industrial sites displayed higher
values in all seasons. During the dry season, the maximum PM2.5 levels were found to
be 230.3 µg m−3 for the urban/industrial and 226.3 µg m−3 for the suburban sites, with
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326
9 of 24
means of 31.26 µg m−3 and 26.38 µg m−3, respectively. This is attributed to the prevailing
southwest wind carrying biomass-burning aerosols from Indonesia due to extensive forest
ﬁres in this season [90]. However, the seasonal mean PM2.5 concentrations do not notably
differ in the other seasons (lying between 17.80 µg m−3 and 22.33 µg m−3 for both ur-
ban/industrial and suburban/rural sites), indicating a year-long PM2.5 laden atmosphere
across Malaysia. Regarding the Himawari-8 AOD, it is higher during the dry season,
while slightly lower mean values (~0.6 to 0.8) were observed in the other seasons, with
marginal differences between urban/industrial and suburban/rural sites (Figure 3b). The
seasonal and site variations of the columnar AODs are in agreement with ground PM2.5
concentrations, indicating that the industrial and trafﬁc emissions are the main pollution
sources for urban centres and surrounding areas. In general, heavy precipitation during
the wet season only marginally reduced the aerosol levels since severe pollution episodes
with PM2.5 > 100 µg m−3 and AODs > 3 were also present. However, the columnar AOD
displayed a very low correlation (R2 = 0.09) with the surface PM2.5, indicating (i) a sig-
niﬁcant aerosol loading aloft and (ii) different sources and temporal variability between
surface PM2.5 and AODs [137]. In addition, the mean concentrations of CO, NO2 and
O3 (Figure 3c–e) are higher over the urban/industrial areas compared to suburban/rural
sites in each season. Motor vehicle and power plants emissions are the major contributors
to CO and NO2 concentrations in Malaysia with about 95.7% and 66%, respectively [11],
thus explaining the higher NO2 and CO levels in urban/industrial areas. The stronger
correlation was found between CO and PM2.5 (R2 = 0.33), revealing that the particulate
pollution in Malaysia is mostly related to local sources of fossil fuel and biofuel combustion,
which enhance CO emissions [86,138]. NO2, which is mostly related to vehicular emissions,
was negligibly associated with PM2.5 concentrations (R2 = 0.1), The overall mean SO2 con-
centration was found to be 1.2 ppb, with slightly larger levels in the dry season, exhibiting
means of 1.5 ppb and 1.3 ppb for the urban/industrial and suburban sites, respectively.
5.2. Models for PM2.5 Estimation
In this study, seven models were developed for PM2.5 estimations in Malaysia using
ML techniques, namely, SVR and RF. These models were developed in order to better
capture the remarkable spatial (between stations of different characteristics) and temporal
(between seasons) variations of PM2.5 and to examine the model’s capability in representing
the levels and evolution of PM2.5. The developed models are:
Model 1: Overall model;
Model 2: Spatial model (urban/industrial);
Model 3: Spatial model (suburban/rural);
Model 4: Temporal model (dry season);
Model 5: Temporal model (wet season);
Model 6: Temporal model (inter-monsoon, April–May);
Model 7: Temporal model (inter-monsoon, October).
The models’ inputs consist of AOD, SO2, NO2, CO, O3, WS, WD, TEMP and RH, with
the total number of the matching samples for all variables (overall model) to be 13,376 at
the 65 monitoring stations from January 2018 to December 2019. The scatter plots between
measured and predicted PM2.5 concentrations via the SVR and RF models are shown
in Figures 4 and 5 for the validation of the 7 developed models, while Supplementary
Materials Table S2 summarizes the statistical indicators of R2, RMSE, MBE and NSE, as
well as the importance ranking, for each input variable at the 7 developed models. The
statistical indicators correspond to the averaged values of each model for the given number
of data (N).

The evaluation of the calibration datasets for the overall model 1 showed that the SVR
model yielded comparable accuracy (R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 10.62 µg m−3, NSE = 0.679 and
MBE = −1.392) to RF (R2 = 0.66; RMSE = 11.28 µg m−3, NSE = 0.939 and low MBE = 0.066)
(Supplementary Materials Table S2). The validation dataset displayed also small differ-
ences between the two models and comparable statistics with the calibration datasets i.e.,
R2 = 0.66 and RMSE = 12.11 µg m−3 for SVR and R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 11.40 µg m−3 for RF
(Figure 4).
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326
12 of 24
Furthermore, other models for estimating PM2.5 were also developed by splitting the
entire datasets initially into two categories namely urban/industrial (3357 data points)
and suburban/rural (N = 9798). The RF model performed slightly better compared
to SVR for urban/industrial (model 2) and suburban (model 3) sites, with R2 = 0.76,
RMSE = 11.47 µg m−3, NSE = 0.735 and R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 12.47 µg m−3, NSE = 0.661,
respectively. Regarding the calibration datasets, the NSE values of all the RF models
were usually above 0.9, indicating an accurate model’s performance, compared to the
SVR models, which exhibited NSE values in the range of 0.55 to 0.79 for the calibration
datasets (Supplementary Materials Table S2). The model validation revealed that RF
models performed slightly better than the SVR models for both locations. The validation
of SVR and RF models for suburban sites was considered satisfactory with R2 = 0.61,
RMSE = 11.53 µg m−3 and R2 = 0.64, RMSE= 10.76 µg m−3, respectively (Figure 4b,c). Both
models performed better at urban/industrial sites compared to the suburban sites, while
all models underestimated the large PM2.5 concentrations (PM2.5 > 60 µg m−3). For PM2.5
below 50 µg m−3, where the vast majority of the data points lie, the underestimated and
overestimated data points are almost equal for all the models and the regression line tends
to coincide with the 1-1 line (Figure 4).
In addition, four temporal models were also developed for each season in Malaysia,
namely, dry season (June–September; Figure 5a,b), wet season (November–March; Figure 5c,d)
and two inter-monsoon seasons (April–May; Figure 5e,f and October; Figure 5g,h). The total
number of data for the temporal models is 4223, 5797, 2441 and 915 for the dry season,
wet season, April-May and October, respectively. These datasets were randomly divided
into calibration and validation groups, and the results of the statistical evaluations of the
seasonal PM2.5 predictions are included in Supplementary Materials Table S2 (models 4–7).
The estimation accuracy of PM2.5 concentrations via the SVR and RF models varied between
the seasons, while it was relatively lower in the wet and inter-monsoon (April-May) seasons
for both models. For instance, the R2 values for the calibration dataset of the SVR model were
0.81, 0.62, 0.58 and 0.74 for the dry, wet seasons, April-May and October, respectively. The RF
models exhibited slightly lower RMSE values compared to the SVR models, as 13.61 µg m−3,
9.99 µg m−3, 8.36 µg m−3 and 12.41 µg m−3 against 14.0, 10.9, 9.38 and 12.46 µg m−3 for dry,
wet, April-May and October, respectively. Furthermore, RF models displayed higher NSE
values compared to SVR, while the PM2.5 underestimations from the SVR models (negative
MBE values) are eliminated by using the RF models (Supplementary Materials Table S2;
Figure 5).
The statistical evaluators of the developed models in Malaysia are mostly comparable
to those found from multi-variate models including AOD and several meteorological
parameters (Temp, RH, WS, Dew point, mixing height) for PM2.5 estimations in Indian
cities [139]. More recently, [39] developed a deep neural network consisted of recurrent
layers for extracting the relationship between high-resolution (1 km) MODIS observations
and PM10, PM2.5 concentrations in Tehran, Iran. The PM2.5 and PM10 estimations resulted
in RMSE values of 11.66 µg m−3 and 23.79 µg m−3, respectively, comparable to the current
results and previous RMSE values for PM10 estimations in Malaysia (11.61 µg m−3; [18])
and Delhi (18.99 µg m−3; [140]). MODIS-MAIAC AODs and columnar water vapor (CWV),
along with meteorological parameters and land-use data, were included in a linear mixed
effect model (LME) and a RF model for daily PM2.5 estimations at high spatial resolution
(1 km × 1 km) over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), India [118]. The RF model exhibited
higher accuracy with R2 = 0.87 and relative RMSE of 24.5%, compared to LME [118]. The
spatial distributions of the R2 (~0.6 to 0.9) and RMSE (~20 to 40 µg m−3) values from PM2.5
estimations across the IGP [118] were mostly comparable to those observed over Malaysia.
The hourly time series of the measured and predicted PM2.5 concentrations via the SVR
model, separately for the station characteristics and seasons and for the overall model, are
shown in Figure 6. The results verify the good performance of the SVR model in predicting
the PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia—RF performed slightly better with very similar
results—also revealing an underestimation at the highest PM2.5 values. However, the
Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 7326
13 of 24
model’s underestimation in representing PM2.5 peaks is not systematic, and in many cases,
models reproduce satisfactorily the high PM2.5 concentrations, even overestimating them
(Figure 6).
Figure 6. Time series (hourly) of measured (black) and predicted (red) PM2.5 concentrations from
the SVR model across Malaysia for urban/industrial (a), suburban/rural (b), dry season (c), wet
season (d), April–May (e), October (f) and overall (g) models. The available data set for each group is
mentioned in the panels. The X axis shows number of datasets.
The residual analysis for the model validation datasets revealed that the frequency
of residuals approached the normal distribution peaking around zero for all the models
(Supplementary Materials Figure S1). However, the frequency distributions were slightly
shifted towards negative values, as the highest model underestimations may reach to
−60%, but for very rare cases. In the vast majority of the cases, the predictions were
quite accurate, indicating that the used ML models are satisfactory for PM2.5 estimations
in Malaysia.
Atmosphere is a complex system and composed by various substances like air molecules
and solid and liquid particles of various sizes, shapes and chemical composition [141,142].
Therefore, combining many auxiliary data such as meteorological factors, aerosols, gases
and land use allows for a better estimation of PM2.5. To date, most PM prediction studies
found that inclusion of meteorological factors has improved the PM estimations, because each
meteorology parameter may modulate the PM concentrations in a different way [43,45,71].
Nowadays, ML techniques and RF models are frequently used in estimating PM concentra-
tions at many regions around the world [39,116,119]. The statistical indicators from the models’
calibration and validation in this study (Supplementary Materials Table S2; Figures 4 and 5)
are mostly comparable to those presented in other studies using various methods and ML
approaches for estimates of PM concentrations around the world (Table 2). It should be noted
that this study obtained reasonable results at national scale without including land use infor-
mation compared to previous works [128,143–145]. Besides that, the validation techniques
may be also different, as for instance [143] used sample and site based 10 CV in order to assess
the spatial performance, whilst our study only used sample based 10 CV since it can be used
to reflect the overall predictive ability [130].

Determining the strength of the correlation between PM2.5 and all the parameters
used for its prediction is very important because it can indirectly portray the pollution
process and the source of the pollution. The results of the variable importance analysis for
the RF model have been included in Supplementary Materials Table S2 and are shown in
Figure 7. For the overall model 1, CO is the highest contributor to the PM2.5 estimations,
similar to the other models, as discussed above, and is followed by AOD, O3, NO2, SO2
and the meteorological parameters. This is because both PM2.5 and CO are originated
from common sources in Malaysia like biomass burning and trafﬁc which enhance the CO
emissions [86,138]. Besides that, CO may stay in the atmosphere for a long period (weeks
or months), being able to get transported in high concentrations from biomass-burning
areas in Indonesia [152]. Parameters with the least importance in PM2.5 estimations are
RH, WD, TEMP and ﬁnally the WS with a zero score (Figure 7a). Similar to the overall
model (model 1), the contributions of the meteorological parameters were relatively weak
in the spatial models as well, which also revealed CO, AOD and O3 as the most important
variables (Figure 7b,c). CO remains the most important predictor in the seasonal models as
well, with minimal contributions from the meteorological variables (Figure 7d–g). The WS
and WD have minimal contributions, in agreement with [81], who found that both parame-
ters were not signiﬁcantly correlated with PM2.5 in the Klang Valley region in Peninsular
Malaysia. Although AOD usually exhibited a high correlation with PM2.5 [153], in our
case, there was not a direct association with PM2.5 concentrations, implying complicated
pollution conditions in the vertical layer over Malaysia [141]. Generally, PM2.5 is affected
more by gaseous pollutants and not so much by the columnar AOD (missing values due
to cloud cover and elevated aerosol layers) and meteorological conditions since Malaysia
has rather uniform weather conditions throughout the year. Therefore, inﬂuence of the
meteorological parameters is minimal towards seasonally changing PM2.5 concentrations.
However, previous studies in Malaysia showed that the meteorological parameters affected
the coarse particles, e.g., PM10 concentrations [81], indicating a meteorological-dependent
character of the coarse-mode aerosols. In our previous study [18], we found that the
estimations of PM10 concentrations based on satellite AODs were signiﬁcantly improved
after inclusion of the meteorological parameters in the model.
Similar to the current results, [154] also found that the parameters with the high-
est importance in predicting PM2.5 concentrations are CO, NO2, SO2 and AOD. Inclu-
sion of the pollutant gases improved the performance of their RF model from R2 = 0.69,
RMSE = 41.63 µg m−3 to R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 32.74 µg m−3, in a similar way as in the present
study. These results were also in agreement with [65] who found that CO was the most
important variable that explained 20.65% of the variation in estimated PM2.5 concentrations
in Xi’an, China, exhibiting a strong correlation with AOD. Furthermore, [81] studied the
PM2.5 composition in Klang Valley, Malaysia, and concluded that CO, NO2, NO and SO2
mostly affected the PM2.5 concentrations.
This is the ﬁrst study conducted in Malaysia aiming to estimate the PM2.5 concentra-
tions based on machine-learning techniques. The satisfactory accuracy of the estimates,
despite the biases and challenges in representing PM2.5 pollution episodes, is especially
important for the development of models aiming to systematically monitor PM2.5 over the
country, especially at remote areas with unavailability of measurements. However, the only
65 operational stations are still insufﬁcient to cover the whole Malaysian territory with an
area of 330,290 km2. Establishing more air quality monitoring stations is very costly, and a
certain station is only capable to satisfactorily represent the pollutant concentrations within
a radius of about 15 km [155]. Alternatively, remote sensing data encourages more studies
to be conducted on atmospheric particulates and air quality, since satellite technology
considers AOD as a key predictor of PM over a large area [156]. This would also help
in evaluating the inﬂuence of the local/regional emissions from anthropogenic activities
against those attributed to natural causes or long-range transported aerosols, mostly smoke,
from Indonesia and other parts in northern Indochina.

6. Conclusions
The current study developed new machine-learning models, namely, Random Forest
(RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), to estimate PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia
for the ﬁrst time covering the years 2018 and 2019. Satellite (Himawari-8) AOD, ground-
measured air pollutants (NO2, CO, SO2, O3) and meteorological parameters (temperature,
relative humidity, wind speed and direction) were used as input variables. Due to the high
spatial (between stations with different characteristics like urban/industrial and subur-
ban/rural) and temporal (between seasons) evolution of the PM2.5 levels across Malaysia,
seven sub-models were developed separately for the different sites (urban/industrial,
suburban/rural) and seasons (dry, wet and two inter-monsoons (April-May and October)),
and one overall model. Of the available dataset, 70% was randomly selected for the model
calibration, and the remaining 30% for the model validation. The PM2.5 predictions of
each model are compared to those measured at 65 air pollution monitoring stations, using
standard statistical estimators.

For the overall model, SVR calibration performed slightly better than RF with R2 = 0.69
and RMSE = 10.62 µg m−3 against measured PM2.5 concentrations. Whilst for the spatial
models, the RF validation performed slightly better than SVR, with statistical indicators of
R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 11.47 µg m−3 for urban/industrial, and R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 10.76 µg m−3
for the suburban/rural sites. Therefore, both RF and SVR models displayed slightly higher
performance for PM2.5 estimations at urban/industrial sites with higher levels of AOD and
air pollutants. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy of SVR and RF models was lower in
the wet (November–March) and inter-monsoon (April–May) seasons compared to the dry
(June–September) season. Based on the model accuracy and variable importance analysis,
CO was always the most inﬂuential predictor variable for PM2.5 estimations in Malaysia,
followed by AOD, O3, NO2, SO2 and meteorological parameters but with different order
depending on the dataset and model. An important ﬁnding was the very weak correlation
and contribution of the meteorological variables to PM2.5 estimations. Furthermore, very
low correlation was found between PM2.5 and columnar AOD, indicating that surface
pollution followed a different temporal pattern than AOD and the presence of a signiﬁcant
aerosol layer aloft due to transported smoke plumes from wildﬁres in southeast Asia. The
current results showed that the use of machine-learning techniques for PM2.5 estimations
over Malaysia was promising as these models can satisfactorily represent the values and
temporal evolution of PM2.5 concentrations over both urban/industrial and suburban/rural
sites although the underestimation of the highest PM2.5 levels. In a next step, gaseous
pollutants from satellite remote sensing observations will be included in ML approaches
in order to estimate PM2.5 concentrations over large areas, aiming to cover the whole
Malaysian territory.

Air pollution assessment in urban and rural areas is really challenging due to high spatio-temporal variability of 
aerosols and pollutants and the uncertainties in measurements and modelling estimates. Nevertheless, accurate 
determination of the pollution sources and distribution of PM2.5 concentrations is especially important for source 
apportionment and mitigation strategies. This study provides estimates of PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia 
in high spatial resolution, based on multi-satellite data and machine learning (ML) models, namely Random 
Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), also covering remote 
areas without measurement networks. The study aims to develop ML models that are simpler than previous 
works and demonstrate computational efficiency. Six sub-models were developed to represent different locations 
and seasons in Malaysia. Model 1 includes all data from 65 air-quality stations, Models 2 and 3 characterize 
urban/industrial and suburban sites, respectively, while Models 4 to 6 correspond to dry, wet, and inter-monsoon 
seasons, respectively. The RF technique exhibited slightly better performance compared to the XGBoost and SVR 
approaches. More specifically, for model 1, it exhibited a high correlation with a coefficient of determination (R2) 
of 0.64 and RMSE of 12.17 μg m−3, while similar results were obtained for models 3, model 4 and model 5. The 
lower performance (R2 = 0.16–0.94) observed in the wet and inter-monsoon seasons is due to fewer number of 
data used in model calibration. Integration of two AOD products from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and 
Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors together with gases pollutants from Sentinel 5P 
enabled seamless seasonal PM2.5 mapping over Malaysia, even for a short period of time. However, usage of data 
with insufficient information during the model training procedure, and lack of satellite data due to cloud 
contamination, can limit the PM2.5 prediction accuracy.   
1. Introduction 
The rapid development of the urban population in southeast Asian 
countries, as well as the increasing loading of transportation, industrial 
sector and energy consumption, have resulted in high levels of air 
pollution, particularly in the metropolitan centres, that are far exceeding 
the World Health Organization (WHO)’s standards for air quality (Amil 
et al., 2016; Ezani et al., 2021). Particulate matter (PM) is the primary 
indicator to assess the air quality and it consists of carbonaceous 
aerosols, inorganic species, dust and biogenic particles, reactive and 
heavy metals (Hamanaka and Mutlu, 2018; Pani et al., 2018; Theodosi 
et al., 2018; Retama et al., 2022). The contributors of air pollution in 
Malaysia are not only come from local sources like motor vehicles, 
power plants, industries and open fires (Khan et al., 2015; Abdullah 
et al., 2019), but also originate from transported biomass-burning 
aerosols from neighbouring countries like Indonesia, Thailand and 
Indochina (Abas et al., 2004; Kanniah et al., 2014; Latif et al., 2018; 
Kanniah and Zaman, 2021; Pani et al., 2021). PM2.5 constitutes a major

concern to ecosystems, global climate, and especially, public health, 
since the multiple chronic respiratory, cardiovascular and neurotoxic 
diseases that are associated with air pollution are widely known (Kloog 
et al., 2012; Munir et al., 2016; Xing et al., 2016). Therefore, due to 
deleterious effects on human health, precise estimates of PM2.5 levels 
and their spatio-temporal evolution at a high resolution, are also useful 
for epidemiological studies (Sobri et al., 2021; Zalakeviciute et al., 2021; 
Chinatamby and Jewaratnam, 2023). Nowadays, the air-pollution 
concern on human health has become especially high in the devel­
oping countries of southeast Asia, since more than 90% of deaths related 
to air pollution were recorded in low-income countries (Gakidou et al., 
2017; Wongnakae et al., 2023). Due to complex spatial and temporal 
variation of PM2.5, continuous monitoring covering large areas can 
provide a better understanding of PM2.5 characteristics (Chu et al., 
2016). In particular, remote sensing observations allow for a continuous 
estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 on large spatial scales (Zaman et al., 2017; 
Ramli et al., 2023). 
Numerous studies have implemented satellite-derived aerosol opti­
cal depth (AOD) products as the primary predictor variable for esti­
mating PM2.5 concentrations from space (Liu et al., 2007; Munir et al., 
2016; Lv et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017; Chen and Huang, 2018; Imani, 
2021; Zang et al., 2021). AOD is a physical parameter representing the 
quantity of light absorbed and scattered by suspended particles in the 
vertical atmospheric column (Shtein et al., 2019). Nowadays, several 
satellite sensors provide AOD products like the Multiangle Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MISR), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer 
(AVHRR), Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Moder­
ate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared 
Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), among others, with various 
spatio-temporal resolutions. However, AOD has finite capability over 
the tropical environment, i.e Southeast Asian (SEA) region, due to 
several missing data caused by heavy and extensive cloudiness (Zaman 
et al., 2017). Consequently, producing a PM2.5 map covering the whole 
region has become very difficult and a real challenge. Alternatively, 
geostationary satellites are recently used for these applications, such as 
the Himawari-8 (Wang et al., 2017; Chen and Huang, 2018; Xiao et al., 
2018; Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 
2022), since they provide high temporal resolution data (every 30 min) 
that increases the possibility to get cloud free areas. Missing of satellite 
AOD data is generally recreated on the same image using gap filling 
techniques such as multi-source AOD data fusion (Zou et al., 2016a; Wei 
et al., 2019), interpolation techniques (Zaman et al., 2017), 
multi-variable AOD estimation methods (Di et al., 2019; Shtein et al., 
2019) and combined applications (Chen et al., 2019), but all of them 
have a degree of uncertainty, which increases when large data gaps 
exist. 
The relationship between AOD and PM is generally investigated 
using empirical statistical techniques and machine learning (ML) models 
(Soleimany et al., 2022; Subramaniam et al., 2022; Tuna Tuygun et al., 
2022). Various statistical regression techniques have been employed to 
investigate the association between AOD and PM as the basis for the 
satellite-based PM2.5 predictions, like Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) 
(Ul-Saufie et al., 2012; Benas et al., 2013; Zaman et al., 2017; Dutta and 
Jinsart, 2021), Chemical Transport Models (CTM) (Van Donkelaar et al., 
2010; Hystad et al., 2011; Geng et al., 2015; Crouse et al., 2016), Mixed 
Effect Models (MEM) (Kloog et al., 2011; Beloconi et al., 2016; Ngo 
et al., 2023), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Han and Sohn, 2013; 
Moustris et al., 2013; Dutta and Jinsart, 2021), Geographic Weighted 
Regression (GWR) (Hu et al., 2013; Song et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016; 
Zou et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2017), geographically and temporally 
weighted regression (GTWR) (Bai et al., 2016; He et al., 2021), Gener­
alized Additive Models (GAM) (Liu et al., 2009; Paciorek and Liu, 2009; 
Song et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2016a) and multi stage models (Hu et al., 
2014; Ma et al., 2016). 
Unlike the regression approach, where data is adapted to the model, 
in ML techniques, the model is adapted to the data. As a result of a 
greater versatility, ML techniques have become popular for PM2.5 esti­
mations, since they are capable of resolving complexities and nonlinear 
distribution in the dataset (Shin et al., 2020). Indeed, ML techniques 
such as the random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), 
extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep learning (DL) produce 
more satisfying results than the traditional statistical techniques (Li 
et al., 2018). Therefore, the use of ML makes it possible to capture the 
complicated interactions that exist between the parameters, resulting in 
an improved ability to estimate PM2.5 (Danesh Yazdi et al., 2020). 
Numerous attempts have been made to combine meteorological 
variables and land use data in order to improve PM2.5 estimations using 
ML techniques (Guo et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Zhan et al., 2017; 
Chen et al., 2018). However, only a few studies have incorporated 
gaseous pollutants when estimating PM2.5 concentrations (Song et al., 
2015; Kusuma et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Zaman et al., 2021; Han 
et al., 2022). Generally, some chemical air compounds, such as nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are considered to be the pre­
cursors of PM2.5 (Baker and Scheff, 2007). Thus, it is plausible to include 
gaseous pollutants in order to estimate PM2.5 concentrations. In fact, in 
our previous study, we found that carbon monoxide (CO) followed by 
AOD, O3, NO2, and SO2 were the most influential factors in PM2.5 
variability, while meteorological parameters had only a very weak 
contribution to PM2.5 estimation over Malaysia (Zaman et al., 2021). 
Our earlier model faced some limitations, since it incorporated gaseous 
pollutants and meteorological parameters from ground monitoring sta­
tions (Zaman et al., 2021). This posed challenges in accurately deter­
mining PM2.5 concentrations in areas where ground measurements were 
unavailable. It should be noted that the implementation of our previ­
ously developed model was quite complicated due to numerous pa­
rameters involved and we had to interpolate most of the parameters 
(CO, O3, NO2, SO2, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and 
temperature) to produce spatial mapping of PM2.5. (Zaman et al., 2017, 
2021). In this study, we modified our previous models by incorporated 
only the influential parameters (AOD, CO, O3, NO2 and SO2) that can be 
retrieved from satellites. The current update also includes AOD fusion 
from multi-source sensors (Himawari-8 and Suomi-NPP) to provide 
seamless AOD information, due to extensive data missing as a result of 
heavy cloudiness in the tropical region of Malaysia. Additionally, the 
estimations of PM2.5 using three ML techniques namely SVR, RF and 
XGBoost over the whole Malaysian territory were compared and eval­
uated against ground measurements. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first study used entire predictors (gaseous pollutants and AOD) 
obtained exclusively from remote-sensing satellite data for the estima­
tion of PM2.5 concentrations in the tropical region. Developing models 
for PM2.5 estimations at larger spatial scales, using data derived entirely 
from satellites, will reduce our dependency on ground data, which are 
usually costly and difficult to obtain in the developing countries like 
Malaysia. The produced PM2.5 maps will help in depicting the spatial 
and temporal distribution of PM2.5 pollution in Malaysia, and also in 
formulating strategies for improving air quality throughout the country. 
2. Study area 
Malaysia is rapidly growing in terms of economic transformation in 
manufacturing and transportation sectors, which are responsible for 
significant and growing levels of air pollution (Afroz et al., 2003; 
Jamalani et al., 2018; Latif et al., 2018). Besides the local aerosol pro­
duction, Malaysia also receives considerable amount of aerosols and 
pollutants (mostly biomass smoke) from neighbouring countries during 
the dry southwest monsoon season (Latif et al., 2018; Othman et al., 
2021). Currently, there are 65 air quality monitoring stations distributed 
throughout Malaysia, as depicted in Fig. 1. These monitoring stations are 
located in industrial, urban, suburban and rural areas in order to 
represent different backgrounds (Rahman et al., 2022). About 50% of 
the stations are located in suburban areas, while only 11 and 7 stations 
are located in urban and industrial areas. Nevertheless, due to expensive 
N.A.F.K. Zaman et al.

instrumentation, maintenance cost and frequent infrastructure de­
ficiencies, the current PM2.5 network cannot provide a high 
spatio-temporal coverage, sufficient to characterize and delineate the 
spatial patterns of pollutants throughout the Malaysian territory, thus 
leading to data-scarce regions, especially in the remote areas and in Is­
land Malaysia (Kanniah et al., 2016). 
3. Datasets 
The datasets used in this research comprise both satellite observa­
tions and ground measurements (PM2.5 concentrations) as described 
below: 
3.1. Ground measurements 
In Malaysia, PM2.5 concentrations started recorded in April 2017 by 
the Department of Environment (DOE). Continuous air quality moni­
toring (CAQM) stations in urban (10 stations), industrial (7 stations), 
suburban (35 stations), rural (12 stations), and background sites (1 
station) use the Thermo Scientific TEOM 1405-DF analyzer to measure 
PM2.5 concentrations (Kanniah et al., 2020). The instrument is a 
continuous dichotomous ambient air monitoring system with two Filter 
Dynamics Measurement Systems used to quantify PM2.5 concentrations 
(Ash’aari et al., 2020). Flow verification for PM10 and PM2.5 data using 
TEOM is performed once a month (Latif et al., 2021). Hourly PM2.5 
concentrations from 1 May 2018 to 30 April 2020 were used in this study 
in order to validate the PM2.5 estimations over each station. 
3.2. Satellite data 
The use of multi-sensor satellite data is an effective way to heal the 
missing AODs from only one sensor. In this study, the missing AODs 
from Himawari-8 are replaced (whenever applicable) with AODs from 
Suomi-NPP satellite. Same method has been recently used by (Ngo et al., 
2023), where they combined AOD products from MODIS Terra, MODIS 
Aqua and Suomi-NPP, in order to enhance AOD coverage due to heavy 
cloudiness in Vietnam. This study used AODs from Himawari-8 and 
Suomi-NPP satellite sensors and pollution gases from Sentinel 5p re­
trievals across Malaysia. 
3.2.1. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) 
The AOD retrievals were acquired from the Advanced Himawari 
Imager (AHI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 
sensors onboard the Himawari-8 and Suomi National Polar-orbiting 
Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellites, respectively. Himawari-8 is a geo­
stationary satellite with 16 spectral bands spanning from visible to 
infrared spectrum (Kikuchi et al., 2018). In this study, Himawari-8 AOD 
at 500 nm (AOD500) level 3 product (5 km spatial and daily temporal 
resolutions) was employed, since it exhibited a better accuracy for 
Malaysian environment (Kanniah et al., 2020). In addition, only “very 
good” quality level AOD500 was retrieved from the Japan Aerospace 
Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) website (http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ptree/i 
ndex.html). 
The VIIRS sensor was launched in October 2011 on board the NPP 
satellite. It has 22 channels covering the spectrum from 412 nm to 
12,050 nm (Wu et al., 2016). Xiao et al. (2016) found that the aerosol 
products provided by VIIRS are of same quality to those from MODIS and 
at a higher spatial resolution of about 6 km. The VIIRS Environmental 
Data Record (EDR) level 2 AOD550 product at 6 km was used in this study 
to fill the missing data of Himawari-8, so to have more data for devel­
oping the PM2.5 estimation models. The Suomi-NPP AOD was retrieved 
from https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/website from 1 May 
2018 to 30 April 2020, similarly to Himawari-8 AODs. Basically, 
Himawari-8 was on hourly basis, Sentinel-5p overpass is only once per 
day (between 11 a.m. and 2.40 p.m. local time), while Suomi-NPP AODs 
complement our need to overcome the missing Himawari-8 AODs, as it 
has the same overpass time with Sentinel-5p, which is 13:30 p.m. across 
the equator (Small, 2021; Van Geffen et al., 2022). 
3.2.2. Gases pollutants 
The Sentinel-5p is the first satellite with a specific sensor for atmo­
spheric composition measurements. Sentinel 5-p was launched on 
Fig. 1. Spatial distribution of the ground-based air-pollution monitoring stations in Malaysia.

October 13, 2017 by the European Space Agency and it carries the 
TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Sentinel-5p is on a 
sun-synchronous orbit with a 1 day revisit period and a 2600 km sweep 
width (Queiβer et al., 2019). TROPOMI is operating at ultraviolet, near 
infrared, and shortwave infrared wavelengths and has also a near-UV 
spectrometer (405–465 nm) (Boersma et al., 2011; Queiβer et al., 
2019). In this study, only the best recommended quality pixels of 
Sentinel 5-p were used in order to remove cloud-contaminated scenes 
(qa value > 0.5 for SO2, CO, O3 and qa value > 0.75 for NO2) (Eskes and 
Eichmann, 2018; Han et al., 2022). Sentinel-5p provides three different 
modes of data, namely near real time (NRT), offline (OFFL) and 
reprocessed data (Oxoli et al., 2020). NRT data are available within 3 h, 
while OFFL data files are available after few days from the acquisition 
time (Ialongo et al., 2020). The reprocessed data is only available when 
major upgrade or improvement of OFFL data is necessary (Oxoli et al., 
2020). In this study, OFFL mode of data products (SO2, NO2, CO and O3) 
was considered, since it provides better quality compared to NRT mode 
and is also highly recommended for trend analysis (Ialongo et al., 2020; 
Oxoli et al., 2020). The data were obtained from the Copernicus Open 
Access Hub: https://s5phub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home for the period 
1 May 2018–30 April 2020. 
3.2.3. Global PM2.5 
The global PM2.5 product was produced by a research group at 
Washington University using the Geographically Weighted Regression 
(GWR) technique. The global PM2.5 product is a combination of several 
data such as Terra and Aqua MODIS, MISR, SeaWiFS, MAIAC, simulated 
data from GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, meteorological pa­
rameters, gases and land data (Van Donkelaar et al., 2021). This dataset 
was obtained from May 2018 to April 2020 from Washington University 
website (https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/), for 
comparison with our seasonal developed PM2.5 maps over Malaysia. 
4. Methodology 
4.1. Pre-processing 
All the Himawari-8 AODs, Suomi-NPP AOD products and gaseous 
pollutants from Sentinel-5p were initially re-projected to geographical 
latitude and longitude (WGS 84) as a standard projection and to ensure 
that both data are in the same coordinate system. 
The AOD data from Himawari-8 were extracted at 5 × 5 km, centered 
over the 65 air-quality monitoring stations. Since Himawari-8 AOD550 
and the rest of Suomi-NPP AOD and Sentinel-5p gases pollutants are at 
different spatial resolutions, where Suomi-NPP (6 km) and Sentinel-5p 
(3.5 × 5.5 km for SO2, O3, NO2 and 7.0 × 5.5 km for CO), resampling 
was performed using the Nearest Neighbour resampling method, since it 
chooses the value closest to the centre of the output cell and retains the 
values of the image cells (Baboo and Devi, 2010; Patil, 2018). The 
advantage of this technique is that preserves the original pixel values. 
Therefore, the Suomi-NPP AOD and Sentinel-5p products were all 
resampled at 5 × 5 km, centered over the 65 air-quality stations in 
Malaysia, in order to be consistent with the Himawari-8 AOD. Similar 
resampling was performed by Ngo et al. (2023), who estimated PM2.5 
concentrations in Vietnam, using MODIS AOD (3 km), VIIRS AOD (6 
km), MODIS NDVI (250 m), ERA-5 meteorological (1ᵒ x 1ᵒ) and popu­
lation density map (100 m) data. 
4.2. Data matching 
AOD from Himawari-8 is on an hourly basis, while Suomi-NPP AOD 
and Sentinel-5p products are delivered as daily data. Sentinel-5p over­
passes Malaysia between 11 a.m. and 2.40 p.m. local time. Both the 
ground based PM2.5 and AOD from Himawari-8 were averaged from 11 
a.m. to 3 p.m. to match with the Sentinel-5p overpass time. A total of 
1114 daily matching datasets from all the sources were obtained over 
the 65 air-quality monitoring stations. Therefore, the PM2.5 estimations 
in this work correspond to noon data and cannot be considered as daily- 
averaged values, since the diurnal pattern of measured PM2.5 may reflect 
differences between daytime and nighttime, also depending on season 
(Othman et al., 2021; Latif et al., 2021). The around noon dataset also 
limits the availability of common datasets from all satellite sensors. 
4.3. Gap filling of missing AOD data 
Data fusion from multi-source data was used as a gap filling method 
to obtain AOD values for days with lack of Himawari-8 AOD. The AODs 
from Suomi-NPP were co-located with Himawari-8 AOD data on daily 
basis. The pixels at the same spatial position on the two products were 
then extracted. Basically, Himawari-8 AOD values were selected prior to 
Suomi-NPP because they exhibited a very good correlation with AER­
ONET AODs (Kanniah et al., 2020). So, if a day has both AOD values, the 
Himawari-8 AOD was selected. Table S1 shows that Suomi NPP/VIIRS 
has slightly lower missing rate compared to Himawari-8. This means 
that VIIRS AODs were used as supplementary to fill missing Himawari-8 
AODs at a particular pixel due to differences in temporal resolution 
between the two satellites. We opted against interpolating the 
Himawari-8 data or Sentinel-5P data due to the potential introduction of 
significant uncertainty, attributed to the limited number of pixels 
available for interpolation (Shin et al., 2020). In order to match spectral 
AODs of both Himawari-8 retrieved at 500 nm and Suomi NPP at 550 
nm, the Himawari-8 AOD500 was converted to AOD550 through equation 
(1) (Zhu et al., 2022). 
AOD550 = AOD500
(550

)α
(1)  
where α is AE_Merged (Ångstr¨om exponent from Himawari-8). 
4.4. Data cleaning 
Data cleaning includes the removal of irrelevant data (e.g. corrupted 
pixel values), filter-out of outliers, and handle missing data. Box-whisker 
plots for each parameter/predictor were developed separately for 
urban/industrial and suburban/rural stations and for each season (wet, 
dry and two inter-monsoons), enabling to represent data distribution 
based on mean, quartile and median values (Bruffaerts et al., 2014). The 
“potential” outliers or irrelevant data were detected and omitted from 
the analysis after careful checking (Hubert and Vandervieren, 2008; 
Bruffaerts et al., 2014). In brief, as long as the data value is logical for 
that particular season and area, it will not be considered as outlier. 
4.5. Data normalization 
Before the models development for the PM2.5 estimates, the AOD, 
SO2, CO, O3 and NO2 data were normalized to enhance the performance 
of the machine learning techniques used in this study (Jo, 2019; Singh 
and Singh, 2020). It should be noted that if the data is obtained from 
various sources and collected in a raw format, they are not feasible for 
statistical analysis because there will be unstructured data (Jo, 2019). 
The purpose of data normalization is to organize all the parameters to 
appear consistent across all records. In other words, this step aims to 
remove unstructured data and redundancy to ensure that only logical 
data will be used for modelling. In this study, min-max normalization 
technique was used to normalize all the data (AOD, SO2, CO, O3 and 
NO2). 
Xnorm = Xold −Xmin
Xmax −Xmin
(2)  
where Xnorm is a value after normalization, while Xold is the value 
before normalization. The data is scaled from 0 to 1 and will end up with 
smaller standard deviation (Jo, 2019).

4.6. PM2.5 estimation 
Three ML techniques namely Support Vector Regression (SVR), 
Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were 
utilized to estimate PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia. The choice of 
SVR, RF and XGBoost models was based on various factors such as the 
nature of the dataset and computational efficiency, while each model 
offers specific advantages. More specifically, SVR exhibits reduced 
sensitivity to outliers, adeptly captures non-linear relationships, and 
manages a substantial number of features without compromising per­
formance. The RF delivers good performance with minimal hyper­
parameter tuning, effectively captures non-linear relationships, and can 
handle data noise and outliers. XGBoost offers various techniques to 
prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Besides that, it can 
capture non-linear relationships in the model, suitable for handling large 
datasets and has a wide range of hyperparameters that can be tuned to 
optimize the model’s performance (Zaman et al., 2021). 
Whilst, the predictor selection was based on variable importance 
ranking conducted in previous study (Zaman et al., 2021) in order to 
determine which parameters influence most the PM2.5 estimation. We 
found that AOD and gaseous pollutants were the most influential factors, 
while meteorological variables only had a minimal effect (Zaman et al., 
2021). Therefore, the current study only considers AOD and gaseous 
pollutants as predictors to estimate PM2.5, aiming to provide more 
simplified and computationally efficient models, without weakening the 
accuracy of the predictions. Then, only data with complete pairs were 
considered for the modeling purpose. For example, if one of the pa­
rameters (i.e. PM2.5, AOD, SO2, NO2, O3 and CO) is missing in a 
particular day, then all other data will be removed from further analysis 
(Patrician, 2002; Van Buuren, 2018). 
Similar to the previous study (Zaman et al., 2021), six different 
models were developed here to elucidate the geographical and seasonal 
variations of PM2.5 concentrations over Malaysia. Model 1 includes data 
from all the 65 stations, while models 2 and 3 are specific for urban/­
industrial and suburban locations, respectively. Models 4–6 represent 
the wet, dry, and inter-monsoon seasons, respectively and are charac­
terized as seasonally-dependent. It is important to highlight that, for this 
study we merged the two inter-monsoon periods into a single model 
(Model 6) to gather additional data and generate a more statistically 
significant model. The Classification And REgression Training (CARET) 
package was used to execute the pre-processing, data splitting, model 
tuning and variable importance ranking (Table S2). The available 
dataset and the ratio of missing data utilized in this study are detailed in 
Table S3. The overall method adopted to achieve the objectives of this 
study is shown in the flowchart of Fig. 2. 
Random Forest (RF) is a non-parametric algorithm and is made up of 
many decision trees that use the tree branch structure to perform pre­
diction and offers unbiased results, since it evaluates the importance of 
each feature/variable (Breiman, 2001; Gholami et al., 2020). RF is also 
simple to be implemented and it involves low computational cost 
(Gholami et al., 2019; Stafoggia et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Danesh 
Yazdi et al., 2020). In this context, we focus on configuring two crucial 
parameters namely mtry and ntree. The mtry parameter represents the 
number of predictors sampled for splitting at each node, while ntree 
corresponds to the total number of trees in the forest. In this study, we 
solely tune mtry since the CARET package automatically handles the 
tuning exclusively for this parameter (Table S2) and we fix ntree at 500, 
as in previous study (Zaman et al., 2021). 
Whilst, Support Vector Regression (SVR) has demonstrated greater 
performance due to its inherent ability to avoid overfitting in regression 
and improved response approximation capability (Chen et al., 2021). 
The specification of the SVR techniques and the parameters used are 
listed in Table 1 and documented in (Zaman et al., 2021). The tuning 
results for SVR technique have been listed in the Supplementary Mate­
rial (Table S1). 
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is one of the decision tree tech­
niques similar to RF. The GBM technique is also known as boosting 
decision tree, where the weak learner and residuals formed from this 
model are used to create a stronger learner. In other words, previous 
models “boosting” the subsequent models and enhance predictions 
(Friedman, 2001; Danesh Yazdi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021). An 
ensemble method in ML is not a new approach, where developed

eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) based on GBM principle and used 
regularization to control overfitting and model complexity. It is capable 
of performing parallel computations and consumes fewer computational 
resources than other approaches (Chen and Guestrin, 2016; Zang et al., 
2021). Basically, RF trains multiple decisions independently, and the 
final model is determined via majority vote, while XGBoost builds one at 
a time, each tree is improved upon the mistakes of previous ones, while 
the final model is a sum of outputs from all the trees (Czernecki et al., 
2021). The XGBoost technique can be more robust than RF only when 
data between classes is balanced and contains little noise, and the pa­
rameters are correctly controlled (Czernecki et al., 2021). A grid search 
on hyper-parameter with 10-fold cross-validation was conducted in this 
study to find the best hyper-parameters, as shown in Table 2, while 
XGBoost was run using “xgboost” package in “R”. 
According to Tarwidi et al. (2023), XGBoost has become the favored 
method for constructing predictive models, owing to its outstanding 
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility. Furthermore, based on few studies, 
which compared the performance of various ML techniques, the three 
ML models used here outperformed other techniques. More specifically, 
RF and SVR were the best among nine models for predicting PM2.5 
concentrations (Vignesh et al., 2023). Xu et al. (2018) compared the 
performance of 8 ML algorithms that used satellite AODs for PM2.5 es­
timations over British Columbia Province, Canada. That study revealed 
that Cubist, RF and XGBoost algorithms performed better among the rest 
ML models. Several other studies listed in our previous work (Zaman 
et al., 2021) also emphasized the superiority of the ML models used in 
this study. 
4.7. Model validation 
In order to assess the model’s performance, a 10-fold cross-validation 
technique based on samples was employed to examine both overfitting 
and predictive power (Li et al., 2017). This is a well-known CV-based 
technique that reveals the validity of the estimation models (Li et al., 
2020). Additionally, station-based cross-validation was utilized to 
evaluate the spatial performance of the model (Li et al., 2017; Wang 
et al., 2021). A sample-based 10-fold cross validation (CV) technique 
was employed in the model calibration, in which the calibration data 
was randomly divided into 10 subsets; at any given time, one subset was 
used for validation and the remaining subsets were used for model 
calibration. Whilst, 10 fold stations-based CV was randomly isolated one 
fold of stations for validation and utilized the remaining nine folds to 
calibrate the model. The accuracy of the model was set by taking the 
average of the 10 subsets. The model evaluation was performed using 
common statistical indicators such as the coefficient of determination 
(R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and 
Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). 
4.8. Variable importance ranking 
In ML studies, certain predictors may not contribute effectively to the 
modelling process to improve the models accuracy and just enhance the 
model’s complexity (Zamani Joharestani et al., 2019). Thus, variable 
importance ranking was employed to assess each variable’s/predictor’s 
contribution to PM2.5 estimations. In this study, we used default function 
(“varImp”) of RF and XGBoost regression that estimates the variable 
importance. The “varImp” function can scale the significance score 
values between 0 and 100 automatically (Zaman et al., 2021). 
4.9. Mapping of PM2.5 
After developing the ML models for PM2.5 estimations, the best 
model was chosen to map the seasonal PM2.5 concentrations across 
Malaysia, with a 5 × 5 km spatial resolution. Annual mean and seasonal 
mapping were accomplished by integrating or averaging the daily PM2.5 
concentrations. Then, the constructed seasonal maps were compared 
with the seasonal measurements at ground stations and global PM2.5 
distribution data from Van Donkelaar et al. (2021), where the seasonal 
mean (hourly mean from ground monitoring) and the map pixel is 
extracted at the 65 monitoring stations. The statistical indicators used to 
validate the PM2.5 mapping include R2, RMSE and relative bias. 
5. Results and discussion 
5.1. Descriptive statistics 
Atmospheric aerosols and surface PM2.5 concentrations may have 
multiple sources in Malaysia and in southeast Asia (SEA) region. Resi­
dential biomass burning for heating or cooking purposes, as well as open 
agricultural burning of crop residue are major sources of Black Carbon 
(BC) in SEA region, along with urban emissions from industries and 
vehicles (Kanniah et al., 2016; Son et al., 2023). Furthermore, organic 
carbon (OC) highly contributes to PM2.5 concentrations in this region 
(Kalita et al., 2020), while marine sources of dimethyl-sulfide, sea salt, 
along with biogenic emissions are also important components of PM2.5. 
Sulfate emissions from urban and industrialized areas and secondary 
sulfate aerosols may be also abundant over remote areas (Pani et al., 
2018). Dust over SEA is rather rare and may be transported from 
long-distant dust sources in Arabia and southwest Asia (Kanniah et al., 
2016). The descriptive statistics of the main air pollutants from May 
2018 to April 2020 over the Malaysian sites are presented in Table 3. 
The daily-mean PM2.5 concentrations range from 0.18 to 184.24 μg m−3 
(Fig. 3a), with mean and median values of 21.65 and 16.83 μg m−3, 
respectively (Table 3). The AOD exhibits mean and median values of 
0.70 and 0.50, respectively with a maximum of 4.36, which indicates a 
generally turbid atmospheric environment in the SEA region (Fig. 3b). 
The mean columnar values of CO, SO2, NO2 and O3 are 0.04 mol m−2, 
0.000026 mol m−2, 0.000034 mol m−2 and 0.12 mol m−2, respectively. 
Box and whisker plots for all these variables at urban/industrial and 
suburban/rural sites for the four seasons are shown in Fig. 3. 
The seasonal-mean PM2.5 levels at urban/industrial locations are 
higher during the dry season (Fig. 3a), which is attributed to local 
sources such as transportation and industrial emissions (Alias et al., 
2014; Khan et al., 2015; Kanniah and Zaman, 2021) and long-distance

travel of Indonesian and Indochina forest-fires aerosols (Khan et al., 
2016; Pani et al., 2021). During the dry season, the seasonal mean PM2.5 
values for urban/industrial and suburban locations were 38.38 μg m−3 
and 29.04 μg m−3, respectively, which are higher compared to other 
seasons. Also, there is a larger possibility for very high PM2.5 levels 
during the dry season, especially in urban/industrial sites, indicating an 
episodic nature of high-pollution events, while the presence of high 
PM2.5 is very limited in the other seasons. Copious rainfall during the 
wet season reduced air pollutants with mean PM2.5 concentrations of 
14.44 μg m−3 (suburban), 16.64 μg m−3 (urban/industrial), while the 
AOD (0.53: suburban, 0.62: urban/industrial), CO (0.04 mol m−2 at both 
sites), and O3 (0.11: at both sites) were also lower due to rainy washout 
(Juneng et al., 2009; Dahari et al., 2020). Furthermore, the urban/­
industrial sites display higher AODs than suburban/rural sites during 
dry, wet, and inter-monsoon seasons (Fig. 3b). 
The seasonal mean CO loading (Fig. 3c) is 0.04 mol m−2 in the dry 
season for both site groups, while the seasonal variation is almost the 
same as in AOD. This is because CO is mostly released together with 
aerosols (AOD) from motor vehicles, various combustion sources and 
biomass burning (Gratsea et al., 2017; Dahari et al., 2020). In addition, 
the overall mean of SO2 total vertical column was almost similar for both 
industrial/urban and suburban/rural sites in all seasons (Fig. 3e), 
revealing regional pollution sources (Biswas and Ayantika, 2021; 
Nguyen et al., 2021), similar to our previous findings (Zaman et al., 
2021). Finally, O3 amounts (Fig. 3f) were slightly higher during the dry 
and inter-monsoon (April–May) periods, attributed to increased solar 
radiation and O3 formation. The differences between urban/industrial 
and suburban/rural sites are marginal, reflecting more seasonal than site 
differences in columnar O3 amount over Malaysia. 
5.2. Models for PM2.5 estimation 
The statistical indicators used to assess the accuracy of the ML 
models (SVR, RF and XGBoost) via sample-based and station-based 10- 
fold cross-validation are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 4. Particularly, 
Model 1 shows that the RF ML technique presented the best performance 
with sample-based and station-based cross-validation, with an accuracy 
of R2 = 0.62, RMSE = 12.45 μg m−3 and R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 12.17 μg 
m−3, respectively. Whilst, XGBoost and SVR demonstrate slightly lower 
performance compared to RF for both CV techniques (Table 4). Models 2 
and 3 provide more detailed PM2.5 estimates for urban/industrial and 
suburban/rural environments, respectively. The SVR technique again 
exhibited only a moderate performance for sample-based CV (R2 = 0.49; 
RMSE = 16.65 μg m−3) for model 2, compared to RF (R2 = 0.62; RMSE 
= 15.35 μg m−3) and XGBoost (R2 = 0.59; RMSE = 16.04 μg m−3). 
Furthermore, the model that was developed using the SVR technique 
exhibited high bias (MBE = −2.323), which indicates the model’s un­
derestimation of PM2.5 compared to the model developed using RF 
(MBE = 0.023) and XGBoost (MBE = −0.015) techniques. In a similar 
modelling work by Pan (2018), XGBoost exhibited slightly better ac­
curacy (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 17.29 μg m−3) in comparison to RF (R2 =
0.94; RMSE = 18.91 μg m−3), SVR (R2 = 0.93; RMSE = 20.45 μg m−3), 
MLR (R2 = 0.92; RMSE = 21.85 μg m−3), and Decision Tree Regression 
(DTR) (R2 = 0.89; RMSE = 25.92 μg m−3). On the other hand, model 3

developed using the SVR technique, underestimated the PM2.5 concen­
trations at suburban sites (MBE = −1.752), compared to the RF (MBE =
0.014) and XGBoost (MBE = −0.008). Generally, the NSE values for 
models 1–3 developed through RF are slightly higher than the XGBoost 
and SVR techniques, suggesting a better performance of the RF model. 
In addition, empirical models were developed to estimate PM2.5 
concentrations at different seasons, during the dry, wet, and inter 
monsoon periods, respectively, as shown in Table 4. The calibration data 
show that RF yielded higher accuracy for model 4 (R2 = 0.70; RMSE =
15.02 μg m−3) in comparison to XGBoost (R2 = 0.69; RMSE = 15.84 μg 
m−3) and SVR (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 16.21 μg m−3). Generally, based on 
the results presented in Table 4, the total number of samples (N) has a 
significant impact on model’s training performance, particularly for the 
RF and XGBoost, since the model’s accuracy drops significantly with a 
few number of data, as shown for models 5–6. Similar results were also 
obtained by Zamani Joharestani et al. (2019), who reported that the 
number of samples affected the accuracy of RF, XGBoost and Deep 
Learning techniques used to estimate PM2.5. It is noteworthy that 
insufficient training samples in machine learning techniques can 
adversely affect the success of the learning process (Forman and Cohen, 
2004). 
Moreover, the results of the station-based cross-validation (CV) 
indicate that RF and XGBoost exhibit commendable spatial predictive 
capability (Table 4 and Fig. 4). The points on the RF scatter plot align 
closely to a straight line compared with the scatter plots of SVR and 
XGBoost, suggesting that the difference between estimated and ground 
PM2.5 is minimal (Fig. 4). Consequently, a robust correlation exists be­
tween the two variables for all models except of models 5 and 6. 
Generally, all the ML techniques exhibited only marginal differences 
among models 1 to 4, with statistical indicators for XGBoost of (R2 =
0.55–0.69; RMSE = 11.38–15.02 μg m−3), for SVR of (R2 = 0.50–0.66; 
RMSE = 13.20–16.64 μg m−3) and for RF of (R2 = 0.57–0.72; RMSE =
11.04–16.16 μg m−3). 
The validation of the seasonal models (models 4–6) shows that they 
performed relatively poor in the wet and inter-monsoon seasons. The 
correlation between estimated and measured PM2.5 yielded low R2 
values (0.25 and 0.20 for the wet season and inter-monsoon, respec­
tively), when the SVR technique was applied. It is essential to highlight 
that the correlations during the inter-monsoon season (Fig. 4f) exhibit 
poorer performance, primarily attributed to the limited number of 
available samples. As mentioned earlier, the deficiency in ample 
training samples in machine learning can have an adverse effect on the 
overall success of the learning process. Therefore, the results of PM2.5 
modelling using daily data from satellite retrievals displayed lower ac­
curacy compared to previous modelling results using hourly datasets 
(Zaman et al., 2021). 
The current results obtained from both CV procedures of the six 
developed models through the three ML techniques are comparable to 
those reported by a previous study (Zaman et al., 2021), which addi­
tionally used several meteorological variables for the model’s develop­
ment. As the variable importance ranking showed less influence of the 
meteorological parameters on PM2.5 predictions over the Malaysian 
sites, the current simplified models justify the satisfactory agreement 
between measured and simulated PM2.5 and are recommended for PM2.5 
predictions over the country, as simpler and with higher computational 
efficiency. On the other hand, there are some studies that presented 
comparable accuracy with current results. Imani (2021) developed a 
deep neural network consisted of recurrent layers for extracting the 
relationship between high-resolution (1 km) MODIS observations and 
PM10, PM2.5 concentrations in Tehran, Iran. The comparisons revealed 
RMSE values of 11.66 μg m−3 and 23.79 μg m−3, respectively for the 
PM2.5 and PM10 estimations. 
Nowadays, ML models have been extensively used in air quality and 
PM2.5 estimations due to their efficiency in handling and solving mul­
tiple non-linear relationships (Yin et al., 2022; Son et al., 2023). Yang 
et al. (2019) used 3-km MODIS AOD retrievals, along with road density 
data and meteorological variables for estimating the PM2.5 in Fuzhou, 
China, through the development of SVR and linear mixed effects (LME) 
ML models. The model’s validation exhibited a R2 of 0.77 and RMSE of 
9.51 μg m−3. Masood and Ahmad (2023) utilized ANN and Gaussian 
regression models to determine the PM2.5 concentrations in New Delhi, 
India, including air quality and meteorological data as inputs. Their 
results showed that the Multi-layer feed-forward neural network model 
exhibited the best performance among the four models used with a 
testing correlation coefficient (R = 0.95) and RMSE of 30.19 μg m−3. 
Gupta et al. (2021) used a Ground Weighted Regression (GWR) model to 
estimate PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations throughout India during 
pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and winter seasons. In addition, Goldberg 
et al. (2019), using 1-km MAIAC AOD retrievals, land use and meteo­
rological data, developed a multiple-linear regression model for PM2.5 
estimations over Eastern United States, with the land use being the 
major contributing factor, followed by AOD. Ding et al. (2021) also used 
multiple models like MLP, LSTM and CNN-LSTM, along with meteoro­
logical and pollutant data for PM2.5 predictions in Beijing, China, 
reporting a better performance (R2 = 0.91; RMSE = 16.46 μg m−3) from 
the CNN-LSTM model. Better performance of LSTM was also reported for

PM2.5 estimations in Delhi, using meteorological and pollutant data as 
inputs (Masood and Ahmad, 2023). 
The daily time series of measured and estimated PM2.5 concentra­
tions using all models are displayed in Fig. 5. The estimated PM2.5 is 
presented separately based on station characteristics and seasons, as 
well as for the overall model. The results illustrate the effective perfor­
mance of the RF and XGBoost models in estimating PM2.5 concentrations 
throughout Malaysia. While SVR showed slightly poor performance but 
with very similar outcomes, all the models exhibited a tendency to un­
derestimate the highest PM2.5 values and an incapability to represent the 
PM2.5 pollution episodes. However, it is important to note that the 
model’s underestimation of PM2.5 peaks is not consistent, and in several 
cases, the models adequately replicate high PM2.5 concentrations, oc­
casionally even overestimating them (Fig. 5).

5.3. Variable importance ranking 
The variable importance ranking was conducted to determine what 
predictors contribute the most/least to the PM2.5 modelling (Zamani 
Joharestani et al., 2019). RF and XGBoost packages have been built in 
function to perform variable importance, as shown in Fig. 6. The current 
analysis showed that the predictor importance was varying over the 
time. The most important input variables are CO, AOD and O3 consis­
tently emerge as the most influential factors across all models for both 
RF and XGBoost (Fig. 6a and b). In the wet season, the most influential 
predictor for RF (Fig. 6i) and XGBoost (Fig. 6j) was CO, followed by O3. 
Furthermore, higher O3 concentration was found during the wet season, 
while the lowest O3 levels occur during the dry season in the urban areas 
of Malaysia (Latif et al., 2012; Mohtar et al., 2018). According to Latif 
et al. (2012), O3 concentration was high between January and April, as 
winter monsoon airflow comes from northeast of Peninsular Malaysia, 
Indochina and South China Sea. The exceedance of O3 during the wet 
season is associated with high levels of O3 precursors and influence from 
local emissions such as transportation and industries (Ahamad et al., 
2014; Mohtar et al., 2018). CO is emitted by incomplete combustion 
from biomass burning, traffic, industrial activity and atmospheric 
oxidation of methane and other hydrocarbons (Borsdorff et al., 2020). 
Biomass burning occurs from May to September in Indonesia (Chang, 
2016), and on an annual basis, transport of CO up to Malaysia may cause 
CO precedence towards PM2.5 concentrations in the dry season (Model 
4; Fig. 6g and h). 
NO2 and SO2 appear to be the least influential factors compared to 
other gases (e.g. CO, O3) and AOD in models 1–3 (Fig. 6a–f). Even 
though sulfate is one of the main components of PM2.5 (Theodosi et al., 
2018; Li and Zhang, 2019; Zhang et al., 2022), SO2 is still less important 
in the models developed using the RF technique. This may be due to the 
chemical property of SO2, which is less active than other gases pollutants 
(Li and Zhang, 2019), revealing that SO2 is not a very important variable 
for PM2.5 estimations in Malaysia, even after removing the influential 
parameters of NO2 and CO. Filonchyk et al. (2018) reported positive 
correlations of PM2.5 and PM10 with SO2 (r = 0.44 and 0.33, respec­
tively) and negative ones with O3 (r = −0.34 and −0.21, respectively) in 
China, while the respective correlations with NO2 and CO were not 
strong and highly unstable. Therefore, the influence and/or the contri­
bution of pollution gases to the columnar AOD and surface PM2.5 con­
centrations is highly site or region specific and depends on the emission 
rates, long-range transport, seasonality of aerosols and pollutants and 
meteorological conditions (Chen et al., 2023). 
5.4. Estimated PM2.5 spatial distribution over Malaysia 
The seasonal patterns of PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia, 
estimated using the model with the best performance (Random Forest), 
are displayed and discussed in this section. The seasonal PM2.5 maps (5 
× 5 km) were generated by averaging the daily PM2.5 concentrations in 
the dry and wet seasons, with the largest data availability (Fig. 7a and 
b). According to the US Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, 
PM2.5 values less than 12.0 μg m−3 are considered “good,” while the 
other groups are divided as: concentrations between 12.1 and 35.4 μg 
m−3 (moderate), 35.5–55.4 μg m−3 (unhealthy for sensitive group), 
55.5–150.4 μg m−3 (unhealthy), 150.5–250.4 μg m−3 (very unhealthy) 
and >250.5 μg m−3 (hazardous atmospheres). 
As expected, the PM2.5 levels across Malaysia were higher in the dry 
season reaching about 30 μg m−3, on average, over the highly populated 
southwest region of Peninsular Malaysia (Fig. 7a). Besides that, hotspots 
of PM2.5 concentrations were observed at the tip of Sarawak due to the 
influence of slash and burning activities in Borneo (Zaman et al., 2017). 
The central part of Peninsular Malaysia also exhibited enhanced PM2.5 
concentrations during the dry season due to severe haze hit in Malaysia 
in the mid-September 2019 (Zainal et al., 2021; Othman et al., 2022; 
Rahman et al., 2022). This is aligned with the study by Othman et al. 
(2022), who found that Fraser Hill, Pahang (located in the center of 
Peninsular Malaysia) exhibited a high mean PM2.5 concentration of 52.9 
μg m−3 during the southwest monsoon due to biomass-burning activ­
ities. During the dry season, the estimated PM2.5 concentrations in cities 
in western Peninsular Malaysia like Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Cheras 
and Klang were in the range of 22.02–27.98 μg m−3 and are considered 
as “moderate”, mainly affected by emissions from urbanization pro­
cesses, vehicles and industries (Ee-Ling et al., 2015; Amil et al., 2016; 
Zaman et al., 2017; Sahak et al., 2022). Whilst, during the wet season 
(Fig. 7b), the spatial-averaged PM2.5 concentrations were much lower 
(11.69 ± 2.35 μg m−3) compared to the dry season (19.42 ± 3.93 μg 
m−3), as a result of the rain washout (Juneng et al., 2009; Abdullah 
et al., 2019). Furthermore, the annual-mean distributions of PM2.5 from 
the overall, urban and rural models are depicted in Fig. S1. This visu­
alization allows us to assess how effectively our models capture the 
PM2.5 concentrations in Malaysia. As anticipated, the spatial distribution 
of PM2.5 is elevated over the densely populated southwestern part of 
Peninsular Malaysia, as depicted in Fig. S1. Notably, PM2.5 concentra­
tions in rural areas, such as central Sabah and Sarawak, are unveiled. 
Kanniah et al. (2020) found that AOD over rural sites may be signifi­
cantly influenced by farming activities, cultivation, biogenic emissions, 
dust, peat, and vegetation fires. Moreover, these elevated PM2.5 con­
centrations may also be linked to the extreme haze phenomenon that 
occurred in 2019. The methodologies developed in this study for esti­
mating PM2.5 prove beneficial for evaluating pollution levels in areas 
where ground measurements are unavailable. 
The seasonal means of estimated PM2.5 with zoomed-in details for 
cities in Peninsular Malaysia (Fig. 7), specifically in the states of Penang 
and Perak (northern states of Peninsular Malaysia) are shown in Fig. 8. 
In semi-urbanized areas in Penang, the seasonal mean PM2.5 concen­
trations around Seberang Jaya (21.40 μg m−3 and 14.91 μg m−3 in dry 
and wet seasons, respectively), Seberang Perai (23.71 μg m−3 and 14.14 
μg m−3) and Balik Pulau (18.42 μg m−3 and 12.43 μg m−3) were noticed 
(Fig. 8a and b). It is worth noting that Seberang Perai and Seberang Jaya 
exhibit generally high PM2.5 concentrations particularly during the dry 
season due to industrial emissions. According to Azman et al. (2017), 
1066 out of 4838 industries would have degraded the air pollution in 
Penang and most of the industries are located in Perai area. 
Meanwhile, Taiping is a semi urbanized city in Perak that experi­
ences high PM2.5 value; 18.33 μg m−3 (Fig. 8c), as it is located within 3 
km from Kemunting industrial area (Azman et al., 2017), with palm oil 
and carbide factories (Suris et al., 2022). Therefore, Taiping exhibits 
significant PM2.5 concentrations although it receives heavy rainfall 
throughout the year with an average of about 4000 mm (Abd Gani et al., 
2015). Whilst, Pegoh which is located in the state of Melaka (middle part 
of the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia), had high PM2.5 levels mainly 
during the dry season (23.22 μg m−3). The reasons for these high con­
centrations can be associated with high anthropogenic emissions (within 
3 km) from large industrial areas such as Sri Rapat, Zarib and Men­
glembu (Azman et al., 2017) and transport of particles from the nearby 
airport (Malacca International Airport). Airport emissions have been 
reported to contribute to significant pollutants in the surrounding areas 
(Fanning et al., 2007; Hudda et al., 2020; Kanniah et al., 2021). 
The severe haze event (15–24 September 2019) can be used as a 
notable case to assess the model’s capability in estimating elevated 
PM2.5 concentrations over Malaysia (Fig. 9). The PM2.5 levels in the west 
coast of Peninsular Malaysia and in the southern part of Sarawak in the 
island Borneo were really high with average values up to 140 μg m−3. 
These high PM2.5 levels were coincided with the El-Ni˜no Southern 
Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, as reported by (METMalaysia, 2019), 
under drier conditions with less precipitation, less cloudiness, prevailing 
westerly winds, and high outgoing long-wave radiation (Che et al., 
2019). 
The PM2.5 concentrations estimated during the severe haze period 
were compared with the average ground-based PM2.5 data (Fig. 10). The 
RF-based PM2.5 estimations revealed a promising consistency with

ground based PM2.5 with R2 = 0.72 and RMSE = 18.11 μg m−3 but with 
an overall overestimation of 12.82%. 
In a step further, the estimated PM2.5 for both seasons were 
compared against the seasonally averaged ground-based PM2.5 data, as 
well as against the global PM2.5 product by Van Donkelaar et al. (2021). 
Based on both comparisons, the current PM2.5 estimations are under­
estimated by about 13%, while for lower PM2.5 concentrations a slight 
overestimation exists (Fig. 11a). Concurrent overestimation of the low 
and underestimation of the high PM2.5 concentrations, was also reported 
by other studies (Mao et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2023), indicating a general 
difficulty in capturing extreme values by ML models. However, our es­
timates are much closer to Van Donkelaar et al. (2021) global PM2.5 
product (Fig. 11), which also underestimates the measured PM2.5 values. 
These results verify a tendency for underestimation of the PM2.5 con­
centrations by the ML models, in agreement with previous studies (Ma 
et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2019; Son et al., 2023). In fact, satellites have a 
finite spatial resolution, meaning that they measure averaged values 
over a specific area. As a result, fine-scale variations, such as localized 
high concentrations of particulate matter, may be missed or smoothed 
out in the satellite data, leading to underestimation. It should be noted 
that the global PM2.5 product uses various input parameters such as 
combination of AODs from multiple satellites (MISR, MODIS, SeaWIFS 
and MAIAC) with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, and then 
correcting them with ground data around the world using the GWR 
method. So, the great consistency between our estimates with the global 
PM2.5 database gives credits to the current modelling approach. How­
ever, the global PM2.5 product is available on monthly and annual 
timescales. Our aim in this study is to provide daily PM2.5 data, which 
would be more useful for atmospheric and health studies. 
These results suggest a satisfactory prediction of PM2.5 concentra­
tions using ML models in a tropical environment, where satellite ob­
servations are highly contaminated by the cloud presence. Nevertheless, 
it should be noted that the use of multi-sensor AOD retrievals produced a 
seamless PM2.5 dataset covering entire Malaysia with only very few lo­
cations (pixels) without PM2.5 values. This is an advancement compared 
to the previous studies that estimated PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations 
across Malaysia from satellite data (Zaman et al., 2017, 2021). Overall, 
this study showed that ML techniques are capable for developing robust 
region-specific models for satisfactory predictions of PM2.5 concentra­
tions over rural and urban areas in Malaysia. The developed models are

efficient tools for management of the high PM2.5 levels and could be 
extended to other air pollutants as well, like O3, NOx, CO, etc. However, 
due to lack of an extensive and dense PM2.5 monitoring network, espe­
cially in remote areas and in Island Malaysia, PM2.5 estimations in these 
regions may be subjected of a higher degree of uncertainty. Further­
more, large gaps in satellite data series further weaken the model’s 
performance. In this study, we did not include the vertical profiles of air 
pollutants and the boundary layer height for the development of the ML 
models, since the main scope is to simplify the models for PM2.5 esti­
mations. Previous studies, also depended on atmospheric gases, were 
found to be capable to estimate PM2.5 without relying on vertical 
columnar profiles (Song et al., 2015; Mami´c et al., 2023; Son et al., 
2023). However, the impact of mixing layer height (MLH) and the 
vertical mixing ratio profiles on PM2.5 concentrations are important, so 
future updates of the modelling approach may include these effects. 
On the other hand, the development of the air-pollution monitoring 
network, expanding and enhancing it with new calibrated low-cost 
sensors, is an urgent task, in a way to enhance the ground data avail­
ability for validation purposes in the future. On the other hand, during 
the recent years, several studies evaluated the performance of MERRA-2 
reanalysis to reconstruct PM2.5 concentrations using near-surface con­
centrations of BC, OC, sulfate, dust and sea salt, implementing ML 
models (Provençal et al., 2017; Carmona et al., 2020; Yin et al., 2021). 
This technique was also proved quite feasible for developing 
region-specific models from MERRA-2 data for satisfactory reconstruc­
tion of PM2.5 concentrations. Such a study has not been performed in 
Malaysia and may establish a new initiative for PM2.5 estimations from 
open-accessed databases. Accurate predictions and forecasting of PM2.5 
levels in urban and rural areas are especially important for the local/­
regional authorities and policy-makers in order to develop the appro­
priate mitigation strategies and policy frameworks for reducing the 
levels and controlling the impacts of air pollution. 
6. Conclusions 
This study developed empirical models using AOD, SO2, NO2, CO and 
O3 retrieved from satellite sensors to estimate PM2.5 concentrations over 
Malaysia through three machine learning techniques namely SVR, RF 
and XGBoost. Separate sub-models were developed for different loca­
tions and seasons. Model 1 included all data from 65 air-quality stations, 
Models 2 and 3 represented urban/industrial and suburban sites, 
respectively, while Models 4 to 6 represented different seasons. The ML 
models validated with 10 fold sample-based CV and station-based CV. 
Model 1 (the overall model) revealed that the RF technique produced 
better accuracy (R2 = 0.64; RMSE = 12.17 μg m−3) compared to the 
models produced with XGBoost (R2 = 0.59; RMSE = 12.24 μg m−3) and 
SVR (R2 = 0.56; RMSE = 14.02 μg m−3). The accuracy of SVR, RF and 
XGBoost with a few number of samples was poor, as obtained for models 
5–6, which led to poorer learning success. 
The variable importance ranking showed that the predictor impor­
tance was varying over time. The most important input variables that 
contributed to the PM2.5 concentrations were CO and AOD followed by 
O3, SO2 and NO2. The current findings showed that RF was able to 
produce acceptable accuracy and fusion of two AOD products (Hima­
wari-8 and Suomi-NPP) that enable to provide seamless seasonal PM2.5 
mapping over Malaysia even for a short period (1 May 2018–30 April 
2020). Although we had achieved seamless PM2.5 maps, yet the esti­
mated PM2.5 was underestimated by about 13%, when compared to the 
ground measured PM2.5 and the global PM2.5 database over Malaysia. In 
particular, the existence of clouds coupled with restricted vertical 
aerosol resolution, affect the accuracy of the retrievals. Thus, the 
availability of Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer 
(GEMS), which provides hourly AODs and atmospheric gases will be 
useful for PM2.5 mapping across Malaysia or even over the whole 
southeast Asia. The accessibility of GEMS dataset presents an opportu­
nity for reconstructing AOD to generate accurate, continuous, and

may provide insights for a comprehensive understanding of the levels, 
spatial distribution, potential sources and the factors influencing the 
PM2.5 concentrations in Malaysia, while the results may help urban 
planners and policymakers in establishing effective pollution-control 
measures and mitigation strategies.

Abstract
This study focuses on the alarming levels of black carbon (BC) and fine particulate matter ­(PM2.5) pollution during winter 
in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study period was chosen to coincide with the cold wave period during winter when temperatures 
were at their lowest. The average concentration of BC (24.2 µgm−3) and ­PM2.5 (73.2 µgm−3) in Dhaka, the capital city, were 
measured and found to surpass national air quality standards and WHO guidelines. The study period had two distinct parts: 
a high pollution (HP) period from January 23–25, 2024, and a low pollution (LP) period from January 12–15, 2024. During 
the HP period, the average BC and ­PM2.5 concentrations were 60 and 36% higher than the overall study period average. On 
the other hand, during the LP period, the average BC and ­PM2.5 concentrations declined by about 30 and 26%, respectively, 
compared to the overall study period averages. High concentrations of BC (> 10 µgm−3) were detected daily, indicating 
significant pollution levels during the winter season. Distinct diurnal patterns were observed during the HP period. Specifi-
cally, the concentration of BC significantly increased during the night, in contrast to the mild diurnal patterns observed in 
the LP period. Moreover, both ­PM2.5 and BC concentrations exhibited a statistically significant negative correlation with 
key meteorological parameters, including wind speed, wind direction, and visibility. This study highlights the critical role 
of meteorological factors in managing air pollution, which has broader implications for environmental sustainability.

Introduction
Black carbon (BC) aerosol originates from incomplete fuel 
combustion and holds significant importance in atmos-
pheric dynamics due to its potential influences on climate 
and human health (Petzold et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2016). BC 
absorbs solar radiation within the visible spectrum, thus 
significantly driving global warming (Jacobson 2010; Bond 
et al. 2013). Apart from its role in influencing climate, it is 
also linked to various respiratory disorders and poses risks 
to cardiovascular health (Jansen et al. 2005; Suglia et al. 
2008b, a). These BC aerosols are integral constituents of 
­PM2.5, which denotes fine particles with a diameter smaller 
than 2.5 µm. They can exert considerable effects on both 
human health and the surrounding environment.
Given the profound effects of BC and ­PM2.5 on air quality, 
climate dynamics, and public health, it is crucial to inves-
tigate its sources to develop effective mitigation strategies 
thoroughly (Budhavant et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2018; Dasari 
et al. 2019). BC has come under increased scrutiny due to 
its small particle size, inert chemical properties, and remark-
able ability to absorb radiation (Bond et al. 2013; Budhavant 
et al. 2020; Nair et al. 2023). These characteristics, cou-
pled with the rising levels of BC emissions, underscore the 
necessity of closely monitoring these aerosols across diverse 
South Asian locations (Gawhane et al. 2019; Dasari et al. 
2020; Nair et al. 2024). Such monitoring efforts are essen-
tial for comprehensively understanding and addressing the

complex challenges of ­PM2.5 and BC pollution (Bibi et al. 
2017; Budhavant et al. 2018, 2023).
Automotive emissions, specifically diesel engines, resi-
dential heating, biomass burning, and industrial activities, 
are human-caused sources of atmospheric BC (Budhavant 
et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2018a; Dasari et al. 2020). In con-
trast, forest fires and volcanic emissions are natural sources 
(Singh et al. 2018c; Budhavant et al. 2023). The transpor-
tation of fine particles over long distances may contribute 
to the amplification of BC concentrations in urban regions, 
which are already subject to the impact of local urban emis-
sions (Aruna et al. 2013; Ji et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019).
Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh, grapples with 
elevated air pollution levels attributed to substantial urban 
development, expanding vehicular traffic, and a grow-
ing industrial sector (Pavel et al. 2021a). Dhaka city faces 
challenges from transboundary air pollution, as emissions 
from neighboring regions worsen the city's air quality fur-
ther (Zaman et al. 2021b, a). Several investigations have 
explored air pollution in Bangladesh (e.g., Salam et al. 2003; 
Pavel et al. 2020; Pavel et al. 2021b, 2023; Zaman et al. 
2022; Azam et al. 2023; Hossain et al. 2023; Hossen et al. 
2023; Roy et al. 2023; Islam et al. 2024; Kamal et al. 2024; 
Nayeem et al. 2024); However, a limited number of these 
studies have focused specifically on BC pollution. Salam 
et al. (2021) explored the combustion sources of BC in high-
loading winter during 2013/14 using dual carbon isotope 
and reported high concentration (13 ± 6 µgm−3) in Dhaka. 
Similar concentrations (11.2 ± 9.8 µgm−3) were reported by 
Begum et al. (2013) in a study conducted from January 2007 
to February 2009. Another study conducted in the brick kilns 
found very high concentrations of BC 16.6 ± 7.1 µgm−3) in 
Dhaka (Haque et al. 2018).
It's crucial to highlight the existing gap in comprehensive 
research explicitly focusing on the relationship between BC 
and ­PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) during high pollution 
periods, particularly in distinguishing between haze and 
non-haze conditions. However, this study aims to address 
this research gap by thoroughly examining the high pollution 
period, specifically in January, and investigating the mete-
orological factors that influence BC concentrations. Conse-
quently, the outcomes of this study will furnish policymak-
ers and stakeholders with invaluable insights, facilitating the 
formulation of efficacious mitigation strategies targeted at 
curbing atmospheric BC levels.
Materials and methods
Site description
Dhaka City, Bangladesh, has a warm and humid climate 
that is influenced by seasonal pattern of pre-monsoon, 
monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter seasons, which often 
result in heavy precipitation and tropical cyclones. Based on 
historical climate data, the average temperature in Bangla-
desh is around 26 °C, with fluctuations ranging from 15 to 
34 °C throughout the year. With an average of approximately 
2,200 mm of rainfall per year, Bangladesh is known for its 
high precipitation levels, contributing to its reputation as 
one of the wettest countries in the world (Pavel et al. 2021a). 
This study period was chosen as the country experienced a 
cold wave, and the temperature was at its lowest between 
December and January during the winter.
The study was conducted at the Department of Chem-
istry, University of Dhaka (23.73°N, 90.39°E, Fig. 1), in 
the heart of Dhaka city on Mukarrom Hossian Khandakar 
(MHK). Two busy highways, Chankharpul Road (0.5 km) 
and Shahbag Road (1.1 km), are near MHK Bhaban. The 
TSC Station, a bustling metro station, is approximately 
0.3 km away. The sampling site is exposed to emissions from 
various sources, which include buses, lorries, private cars, 
and non-motorized vehicles. Although there are no major 
industrial enterprises in the vicinity, smaller chemical and 
other companies are situated within a distance of 2–3 km in 
old Dhaka. Despite being located in an institutional area, 
several large construction projects are nearby, namely high-
rise buildings and metro rail development. The sampling was 
conducted in the ambient atmosphere to capture the area's 
environmental conditions accurately.
Instrumentations
BC mass concentration was continuously monitored through 
the use of a dual-spot Aethalometer (Model AE-33, Magee 
Scientific, USA), operating at a flow rate of 5 L/min and 
providing a time resolution of 1 min (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). 
The device measures BC levels at the surface level at seven 
different wavelengths (370, 470, 525, 590, 660, 880, and 
950 nm). Measurements at 880 nm are commonly used as 
BC aerosols strongly absorb at this wavelength (Hansen 
et al. 1984; Prasad et al. 2018; Shen et al. 2021). Aethalom-
eter was placed on the 3rd floor of the MHK Bhaban, DU at 
around 10 m from the ground level. The device collected BC 
data between January 8 and 27, 2024. The instrument user 
manual was followed to examine the data for discrepancies 
and errors carefully. The screened data was analyzed to cal-
culate hourly and daily averages for this research. Informa-
tion regarding the instrument and sampling methodologies 
has been delineated in numerous studies (Sandradewi et al. 
2008; Drinovec et al. 2015; Prasad et al. 2018).
PM2.5 data was collected using a BlueSky™ sensor manu-
factured by TSI Incorporated, USA. The device was installed 
on the third floor in close proximity to the Aethalometer. 
The sensors utilize a Sensirion sensor (SPS 30) and employ 
the light scattering principle to measure ­PM2.5 concentration

(Gao et al. 2015). The sensor is designed to measure aerosol 
concentrations within the range of 0–1000 µg/m3. It exhibits 
a counting efficiency of 50% at 0.3 µm and 98% at 0.5 µm, 
ensuring an accuracy of ± 10% for concentrations between 
100 and 1000 µg/m3. With optimal performance parameters, 
it operates effectively within a humidity range of 0–95% 
(non-condensing) and a temperature range of − 10 to 60 °C, 
making it well-suited for our study, where relative humidity 
(RH) typically fluctuates between 65 and 90%.
It is crucial to recognize that elevated levels of RH 
can influence the accuracy of PM sensors that use light 
scattering. Previous research has underscored how RH 
affects ­PM2.5 measurements, particularly indicating that 
scattering increases at higher humidity levels (Lee et al. 
2021; Chang et al. 2023; Borhani et al. 2024). Daily ­PM2.5 
data was also collected from January 8–27, 2024. Meteoro-
logical parameters like temperature, RH, windspeed, wind 
direction, visibility, and pressure were collected from https://​
www.​visua​lcros​sing.​com (Fig. 4). The weather station is 
approximately 5 km from MHK Bhaban, DU.

Air mass back trajectories and statistical analysis
The NOAA HYSPLIT model is utilized to determine the 
three-dimensional trajectories of air that arrived at the 
Dhaka measuring site over five days (Fig. 1). These trajecto-
ries are calculated using data from the National Weather Ser-
vice's National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 
Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS, 1 degree). They 
help identify where pollutants originate and how they travel 
to a specific location. This information is crucial in deter-
mining the regional contribution of contaminants at differ-
ent altitudes. The study used Pearson correlation analysis to 
investigate the association between meteorological param-
eters with BC and ­PM2.5 concentrations. Furthermore, Stu-
dent's t-tests determined the significance (p < 0.05) of mean 
differences in BC concentration among these parameters.
Results and discussion
Temporal variation of BC and ­PM2.5
The study aims to analyze the changes in BC and ­PM2.5 over 
time, focusing on identifying patterns and trends in their 
temporal variation (Fig. 2). The average concentration of 
BC was 24.6 ± 8.8 µgm−3, with a range of 14.8–44.2 µgm−3. 
The findings showed high BC concentrations (> 10 µgm−3) 
daily, indicating significant pollution levels during the win-
ter season. Table 1 provides data from other South Asian 
studies to compare the results. For instance, Bano et al. 
(2011) conducted observations during the winter of 2006 
in Delhi, India, utilizing the aethalometer AE 42, reveal-
ing a significantly high concentration of BC at 25.5 µgm−3. 
Similarly, Vaishya et al. (2017) documented a substantial 
BC concentration of 19 ± 14 µgm−3 in Gorakhpur, India, 
during winter, spanning from August 2013 to July 2015. 
The trend of heightened BC levels persisted in Agra, as 
Song et al. (2013) indicated, with a recorded concentra-
tion of 20.6 µgm−3. However, contrasting results emerged 
from studies conducted in other South Asian regions. 
Joshi et al. (2016) found substantially lower BC levels of 
7.9 ± 5.2 µgm−3 in Pantnagar, India. Safai et al. (2008) 
observed a range of 10.5 to 17.4 µgm−3 for BC during 
December 2004 in Agra, underscoring variability within 
the same city over different periods. Across the border in 
Pakistan, Bibi et al. (2017) documented a relatively lower 
BC concentration of 12.5 µgm−3 in Karachi. Similarly, stud-
ies in Dhaka, Bangladesh, revealed comparatively lower 
BC levels: Salam et al. (2021) reported concentrations of 
13 ± 6 µgm−3, while Begum et al. (2013) found levels of 
11.2 ± 9.8 µgm−3.
Throughout the study duration, the mean daily ­PM2.5 con-
centration varied from 50.4 to 106.3 µgm−3, averaging at 
73.4 ± 15.4 µgm−3. This average value exceeds the national 
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) set for Bangladesh, 
which is 65 µgm−3 daily. About 77.8% of days during the 
study period exceeded this limit. Furthermore, the ­PM2.5 
level was five times higher than the daily guidelines set 
by the World Health Organization (WHO-2021) for ­PM2.5 
(15 µgm−3) (Organization 2021). Memhood et al. (2018) 
found similar trends in Islamabad, Pakistan, with a ­PM2.5 
concentration of 69.97 µgm−3 in 2017. They highlighted 
the winter season as the most polluted. Conversely, Ren-
garajan et al. (2011) reported a lower average ­PM2.5 con-
centration of 55.7 µgm−3 in Ahmedabad, India. However, 
higher ­PM2.5 concentrations have also been observed across 
South Asia. Lv et al. (2019) recorded a ­PM2.5 concentration 
of 97.3 µgm−3 in Islamabad during winter 2017, indicating

significant regional pollution levels. Similarly, Singh et al. 
(2021) reported exceptionally high ­PM2.5 concentrations in 
Delhi, reaching 208 ± 44 µgm−3, highlighting the severity of 
pollution episodes in the Indian capital. Pavel et al. (2021a) 
utilized reanalysis model data to report a ­PM2.5 concentra-
tion of 87 ± 10 µgm−3 in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
The variations of BC and ­PM2.5 concentrations in Dhaka 
for the study period are shown in Fig. 2. The figure depicts 
two distinct periods: a high pollution (HP) period observed 
from January 23–25, 2024, and a low pollution (LP) period 
from January 12–15, 2024. During the HP period, the mean 
BC concentration was 39.9 ± 3.8 µgm−3, while the mean 
­PM2.5 concentration was 99.8 ± 7.6 µgm−3. These values 
represent an increase of approximately 60% for BC and 36% 
for ­PM2.5 compared to the average values for the whole study 
period. Conversely, during the LP period, the average BC 
concentration was 17.3 ± 2.5 µgm−3, and the mean ­PM2.5 
concentration was 54.2 ± 3.5 µgm−3, indicating a decrease 
of around 30% for BC and 26% for ­PM2.5 compared to the 
overall study period averages. During the HP period, the 
ratio of BC to ­PM2.5 was approximately 40%, compared to 
around 30% during the LP period. These ratios are signifi-
cantly higher than those reported in studies from countries 
like India, Korea, and Japan, where BC/PM2.5 ratios typi-
cally range from 5 to 30% (Cha et al. 2019; Gawhane et al. 
2019; Krishna et al. 2019; Mori et al. 2020). These findings 
clearly indicate substantial fluctuations in air pollution levels 
in Dhaka, with significantly higher concentrations of BC and 
­PM2.5 during the HP period compared to the LP period. The 
markedly higher BC/PM2.5 ratios observed in Dhaka, relative 
to other regions, emphasize the urgent need for improved air 
quality management in Bangladesh.
Diurnal variation of BC and ­PM2.5
BC concentration in the atmosphere in the daytime and 
nighttime is substantially affected by human activities, such 
as the intensity of source emissions, surface meteorologi-
cal parameters, and mixing height, as well as by natural 
factors, such as solar heat and the density of the bound-
ary layer (Liu et al. 2018; Prasad et al. 2018). Two distinct 
diurnal BC and ­PM2.5 concentration patterns were observed 
at Dhaka (Fig. 3). During the HP period, BC concentra-
tion in Dhaka showed a clear diurnal pattern, with levels 
gradually decreasing from late at night until reaching their 
lowest point at 10 am (20.8 µgm−3). Afterward, there was a 
steady rise in concentrations, peaking at 9 pm (61.1 µgm−3), 
and BC concentrations were consistently higher during 
nighttime compared to daytime. This increase in nighttime 
concentrations was due to low temperatures and reduced 
wind speeds (Fig. 4), facilitating pollutant accumulation. 
Nighttime high BC concentrations were also reported in 
Korea (Lee et al. 2016) and Japan (Yoshikado 2018). On 
the other hand, during the day, the intensification of solar 
heat and the densification of the boundary layer promoted 
pollutant dispersion, leading to a reduction in BC concen-
tration. A similar phenomenon was observed by Bibi et al. 
(2017) and Singh et al. (2018b), who stated that solar heat 
and boundary densification caused the intensification of the 
convective mixing layer, leading to enhanced vertical mixing 
and pollutant dispersion. The intensity of solar heat and the 
density of the boundary layer are the primary factors that 
promote the dispersion of pollutants during the day. During 
the LP, the period of low pollution, mild diurnal variation 
was observed, with a minimum at 2 am (14.4 µgm−3) and a 
maximum at 6 pm (19.5 µgm−3). The reason for this mild 
variation is that the intensity of source emissions is low dur-
ing the LP, leading to lower pollutant concentrations. This 
explains that the complex diurnal variation in BC concen-
tration is influenced by humans and nature. Effective strate-
gies to mitigate air pollution's adverse environmental effects 
and explore potential links with public health through future 
studies are crucial.
Source Identification of Pollutants
This study found that BC (25 ± 9 μgm–3) accounted for about 
34% of the ­PM2.5 (73 ± 15 μgm–3) loadings in Dhaka. BC 
and ­PM2.5 levels had a strong positive correlation (r = 0.76), 
indicating a possible common source. The study by Salam 
et al. (2021) exhibited that in the intense winter period of 
2013/14, 44 ± 1% of BC came from biomass combustion, 
while the remaining portion came from fossil combustion. 
We studied the daily air-mass back trajectories arriving at 
Dhaka to detect the origins of long-range pollution. During 
the HP period, most air-mass routes came from India in the 
west, as shown in Fig. 1. This reveals the negative impact of 
transboundary air pollution on the environment in Dhaka. 
We also analyzed regional meteorological information and 
found that the wind direction during the sampling period dif-
fered from the rest. It was coming from the northeast instead 
of the northwest, as shown in Fig. 4. This demonstrates the 
severity of the effect of transboundary air pollution during 
the HP period.
Previous studies from Bangladesh have conducted cluster 
trajectory analyses to detect the source regions and potential 
air-mass transport (Dasari et al. 2019; Zaman et al. 2021a; 
de Foy et al. 2024; Nair et al. 2024). During the LP period, 
the level of BC and ­PM2.5 was mainly dominated by local 
sources due to meteorological conditions. However, dur-
ing the HP period, contributions from regional pollution 
sources became more prominent (Fig. 4). Figures 2 and 4

provide a comparative analysis of the levels of ­PM2.5 and BC 
throughout both the HP and LP periods. The data reveals an 
important observation: the concentrations of both pollutants 
were almost twice as high during the HP period compared 
to the LP period. This highlights the need for urgent action 
to tackle the issue of declining air quality in Dhaka as well 
as the surrounding regions.
Table 2 reveals the relationship between BC and ­PM2.5 
alongside meteorological parameters measured simultane-
ously. The table highlights that BC has a significant negative 
correlation (p < 0.05) with windspeed, wind direction, and 
visibility. This result aligns with earlier research conducted 
in different regions, suggesting that BC produced locally 
tends to accumulate under low wind speed conditions (Cao 
et al. 2009). Conversely, high wind speeds reduce airborne 
particulate levels by enhancing vertical dispersion. At high 
wind speeds, a decrease in particulate concentrations is 
observed close to specific point or line sources, attributed 
to dilution effects at the source. Wind direction is also a vital 
parameter for reducing BC (Cao et al. 2009), and a strong 
correlation of − 0.66 implies that the sampling site is signifi-
cantly impacted by both local and regional transported air 
pollution in the west direction (Guo et al. 2015). Visibility 
is another crucial parameter affecting urban air quality (Wat-
son 2002). A negative correlation (− 0.42) between visibility 
and BC was also observed in India (Tiwari et al. 2013) and 
Pakistan (Bibi et al. 2017) in the winter season.
The temperature, RH, and pressure remained relatively 
consistent throughout both the HP and LP periods. However, 
there were notable variations in wind speed and visibility. 
During the LP period, the wind speed reached 6.18 kph, 
and visibility expanded to 2.25 km, surpassing respective 
measurements during the HP period, which were recorded 
at 2.81 kph and 1.67 km. The significant decrease in wind 
speed during the HP period resulted in stagnant pollution 
and higher concentration levels. To mitigate the profound 
health consequences of BC and other aerosol pollution in 
Dhaka, mitigation efforts must focus on controlling local 
traffic, regional-scale biomass, and agricultural burning.
Conclusion
Dhaka is currently grappling with a severe issue of air pollu-
tion. It fails to meet the national and WHO standards for BC 
and ­PM2.5 pollution. This study discovered that BC accounted 
for around 34% of the ­PM2.5 loadings in Dhaka. BC and ­PM2.5 
levels demonstrated a robust positive correlation, suggesting 
a potential common origin. During the high pollution period, 
unique diurnal patterns were observed. The BC concentration 
increased considerably at night, in contrast to the mild diurnal 
patterns observed during the low pollution period. Moreo-
ver, ­PM2.5 and BC concentrations have a negative correla-
tion (p < 0.05) with crucial meteorological parameters, such 
as wind speed, wind direction, and visibility. These results 
indicate that meteorological conditions play a substantial role 
in determining the levels of particulate matter in the air, par-
ticularly during periods of heightened pollution. Therefore, 
policymakers and urban planners may need to consider these 
meteorological factors when designing and implementing 
interventions to mitigate the detrimental effects of air pollu-
tion in the city.

Abstract
Background: Although the association between exposure to particulate matter and health is well
established, there remains uncertainty as to whether certain chemical components are more
harmful than others. We explored whether the association between cause-specific hospital
admissions and PM2.5 was modified by PM2.5 chemical composition.
Methods: We estimated the association between daily PM2.5 and emergency hospital admissions
for cardiac causes (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), respiratory
disease, and diabetes in 26 US communities, for the years 2000-2003. Using meta-regression, we
examined how this association was modified by season- and community-specific PM2.5 composition,
controlling for seasonal temperature as a surrogate for ventilation.
Results: For a 10 μg/m3 increase in 2-day averaged PM2.5 concentration we found an increase of
1.89% (95% CI: 1.34- 2.45) in CVD, 2.25% (95% CI: 1.10- 3.42) in MI, 1.85% (95% CI: 1.19- 2.51) in
CHF, 2.74% (95% CI: 1.30- 4.2) in diabetes, and 2.07% (95% CI: 1.20- 2.95) in respiratory
admissions. The association between PM2.5 and CVD admissions was significantly modified when
the mass was high in Br, Cr, Ni, and Na+, while mass high in As, Cr, Mn, OC, Ni, and Na+ modified
MI, and mass high in As, OC, and SO42- modified diabetes admissions. For these species, an
interquartile range increase in their relative proportion was associated with a 1-2% additional
increase in daily admissions per 10 μg/m3 increase in mass.
Conclusions: We found that PM2.5 mass higher in Ni, As, and Cr, as well as Br and OC significantly
increased its effect on hospital admissions. This result suggests that particles from industrial
combustion sources and traffic may, on average, have greater toxicity.
Background
Many studies have shown that ambient particulate air pol-
lution (PM), generally measured as particles with aerody-
namic diameter less then 10 micrometers (PM10), is
associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for
broadly defined cardiovascular or respiratory causes [1-6].

Similar relationships have been reported in locations
reflecting a wide range of particle composition, and con-
centrations of gaseous co-pollutants [7-11].
Diabetics are more susceptible to particles and previous
panel studies and time series analyses have shown this
[12-14].
While previous studies have primarily used ambient PM10
as an exposure metric, PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic
diameter less then 2.5 micrometers) have become a
greater health and regulatory concern due to epidemio-
logic studies suggesting that PM2.5 might have greater tox-
icity than larger particles [15,16].
Nevertheless, as the US Environmental Protection Agency
(US EPA) did not begin monitoring PM2.5 concentrations
until 1999, the literature on the association between
PM2.5 and mortality [16-21] is relatively sparse. There
have been even fewer studies examining the association of
PM2.5 with hospital admissions [22-25].
Fine particles consist of a large number of compounds
and their composition varies spatially and temporally. Its
components can be associated with specific sources, such
as elemental carbon with traffic, nickel with oil burning
and selenium with coal burning power plants. While the
evidence for the health effects of fine particles has been
growing, there is uncertainty as to which components of
these particles are most harmful. Moreover, a better
understanding of the relative toxicity of particles with dif-
fering chemical composition will in turn lead to more tar-
geted emission control strategies and regulations.
One main limitation in examining PM2.5 components is
the irregularity of the PM2.5 speciation data available from
the EPA Speciation Trends Network (STN) monitoring
sites. The STN was established in 2000 and monitors only
report data for every third or sixth day, thus limiting the
statistical power necessary to detect associations between
individual species and health events. The lack of daily
sampling also prevents the examination of time lags and
effect of multi-day exposures.
Consequently, there have been few studies to date exam-
ining the health effects associated with PM2.5 compo-
nents. One study [26] examined the associations between
19 PM2.5 components and daily mortality in six California
counties, and found that PM2.5 mass and several constitu-
ents (EC, OC, NO3-, Fe, K, Ti) were associated especially
with cardiovascular deaths at various lags. Another study
[27] used the elemental composition of PM2.5 to investi-
gate the effect of traffic, residual oil and power plant emis-
sions on daily mortality in six US cities. Their results
indicate that combustion particles in the fine particles
from mobile and coal combustion sources were associ-
ated with increased mortality.
The most recent study [28] examined the differential
effects of PM2.5 species on mortality in 25 U.S. communi-
ties. This study differs from the two previous studies, in
that rather than directly using the observed particle com-
ponent concentrations in their main model, they over-
came the issue of limited statistical power and inability to
examine more than one day exposure due to poor tempo-
ral coverage of data reported from the STN sites by using
a hierarchical approach. The authors first determined the
association between PM2.5 mass and mortality, and then
in a second stage of the analysis, a meta-regression was
used to examine how the pooled association was modi-
fied by community and season particle composition. They
found evidence that Ni (predominantly from oil combus-
tion) as well as Sulfate and As (from coal burning power
plants) increased the mortality risk associated with PM2.5.
In this study we applied the method of Franklin and co-
authors to examine the association between cause-specific
hospital admissions and PM2.5 in 26 U.S. communities,
and explore whether PM2.5 chemical composition played
a role in its toxicity.
Methods
Air Pollution and Meteorological Data
The PM2.5 mass and species concentration data were
obtained online from the EPA Technology Transfer Net-
work Air Quality System [29].
We selected the same cities studied by Franklin et al [30],
but also included Chicago, IL, as we had MEDICARE and
sufficient speciation data between 2000 and 2003. These
cities were originally chosen due to availability of daily
PM2.5 data. For most of these cities, the metropolitan
county encompassed the city and much of its suburbs, but
we used multiple counties for Boston (Suffolk, Norfolk,
and Middlesex), and Minneapolis-St. Paul (Ramsey and
Hennepin). Henceforth we refer to the analyzed geo-
graphical areas as communities.
The STN monitors operate on a 24 hour schedule and col-
lect particles on Teflon, nylon or quartz filters which are
analyzed for trace elements using X-ray fluorescence, for
ions using ion chromatography and for organic and ele-
mental carbon using thermal-optical analysis.
The EPA maintains multiple PM2.5 mass sites, but typically
only one PM2.5 speciation site within a county. In order to
use all the available PM2.5 monitoring sites, the 24-hour
integrated mass concentrations were averaged over the
county using a method previously described [31]. Briefly,
we computed local daily mean concentrations using an

algorithm that accounts for the different monitor-specific
means and variances. However, before averaging, any
monitor that was not well correlated with the others (r <
0.8 for two or more monitor pairs within a community)
was excluded as it likely measured a local pollution source
and would not represent the general population exposure
over the entire county. The number of monitors across the
counties varied between 1 and 4.
Based on results from previous epidemiological studies
[26-33] we focused on the species with different sources
and toxicological background. In particular we focus on
the paper of Franklin et al [30] who also screened the STN
data for inconsistencies based on the percentage of data
below the minimum detection limit and with quality con-
trol flags. We therefore examined the following species:
Arsenic (As), Aluminium (Al), Bromine (Br), Chromium
(Cr), Iron (Fe), Lead (Pb), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni),
Potassium (K), Silicon (Si), Vanadium (V), Zinc (Zn),
ions nitrate (NO3-), Sulfate (SO42-), ammonium (NH4+),
sodium (Na+), elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon
(OC).
For all available observations we computed the ratio
between each species and PM2.5 mass and then took aver-
ages by season across all years to obtain season- and com-
munity-specific long-term mean seasonal concentration
ratios.
Meteorological data including daily mean temperature
and dew point temperature from the predominant
weather station in each community were acquired from
the National Climatic Data Center [34].
Health Data
We extracted data on emergency hospital admissions from
the Health Care Financing Administration (MEDICARE)
billing records for the years 2000-2003. The MEDICARE
system provides hospital coverage for all US citizens aged
65 and over.
Based on evidence from previous studies we chose to
examine causes of admissions which have been associated
with particulate matter and added diabetes as it is related
to CVD complications. We defined cases as persons
admitted from the emergency room with a primary dis-
charge diagnosis of: myocardial infarction (MI, Interna-
tional Classification of Disease ninth revision (ICD-9):
410), diabetes (ICD-9: 250), congestive heart failure
(CHF, ICD-9:428), cardiac disease (CVD, ICD-9:390-
429), and all respiratory disease (RESP, ICD-9:460-519).
Statistical Methods
We applied a time series analysis using Poisson regression
to examine the association between daily counts of cause-
specific admissions and daily PM2.5 mass concentrations
in each community. In each community, the analysis was
stratified by season, since the composition of particles var-
ies seasonally, due in part to different source contribu-
tions at different times of the year. In each community, we
controlled for season and long term trend with a natural
cubic regression spline with 1.5 degrees of freedom (d.f.)
for each season and year (corresponding to six d.f. per
year); day of the week using indicator variables; and three-
day averaged temperature and dew point temperature
with a natural cubic spline with three d.f..
The effect estimates were expressed as a percent increase in
hospital admission with a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5
mass concentration averaged over the day before and the
day of admission.
In the second stage of the analysis, we combined the Pois-
son regression effect estimates using random effects meta-
analysis [35] to obtain an overall effect across all the com-
munities. The season and community specific long-term
mean seasonal concentration ratios, which reflect particle
composition and thus the relative contribution of differ-
ent sources to the PM2.5 mass, were then used in a meta-
regression to quantify to what extent the association
between PM2.5 mass and admissions was modified by par-
ticle composition. This involved regressing the commu-
nity and season-specific Poisson estimates (four for each
community for a total of 104 coefficients) against the
community and season-specific mean concentration
ratios; we first included one element at the time and then
we included those species that were significant effect mod-
ifiers in that first stage in a multivariate model. In the
meta-regression, the variance was composed of the sum of
estimated variance from the first stage, and a random var-
iance-covariance matrix component reflecting heteroge-
neity over and above what can be explained by the
modifier variables, as previously described by Franklin et
al [28] and Zanobetti et al [36].
Franklin et al [30] also found that the association between
PM2.5 mass and mortality was modified by the seasonal
average temperature and used it as a surrogate to explain
ventilation of ambient air to the indoor environment
[37]. They showed an inverted U-shape relationship with
the PM2.5 - mortality effect estimates and temperature
indicating that at extremes of temperature, when windows
and doors are closed resulting in reduced ventilation, the
effect of ambient PM2.5 on mortality was smaller than at
moderate temperatures. We assumed that this phenome-
non held true for hospital admissions and thus the meta-
regression for each outcome included a linear and quad-
ratic term to control for mean temperature.
We used the I2 statistic to assess the proportion of total
variation in effect estimates that was due to between-com-
munity heterogeneity [38]. The I2 statistic, I2 = [Q/(k - 1)]
Environmental Health 2009, 8:58

- 1/[Q/(k - 1)] where k is the number of communities, is a
generalization of the Χ2 or Q test for heterogeneity and
expresses the proportion of variance explained. When Q/
(k - 1) is below 1 there is no heterogeneous variability in
the estimates.
Finally, as there is evidence that socioeconomic status
(SES) plays a role in the health effects of particles (Finkel-
stein 2003; Levy 2000), we examined community-specific
parameters including: median household income, percent
of population below poverty line, percent of adult popu-
lation having graduated high school, and percent of all
households having the head of the household 65 years of
age or older and below poverty level in 1999, obtained
from the US Census Bureau [39]. The community-specific
prevalence of central air conditioning (AC), obtained
from the American Housing Survey [40], was also exam-
ined to address the potential for any residual heterogene-
ity associated with ventilation/particle penetration not
sufficiently accounted for with the quadratic term for sea-
sonally averaged temperature. Each parameter was
included separately in the meta-regression along with
temperature and each species proportion. Although SES
parameters and central AC prevalence did not vary season-
ally, both were included in the seasonal meta-regression.
We used SAS 9.1 [41] for data management, and R 2.7.2
[42] for regression modelling.
Results
Table 1 shows the mean number and standard deviation
of daily hospital admissions in each community by cause,
together with the distribution of the 2-day moving aver-
age of PM2.5. Over all 26 communities we examined
685,716 CVD, 121,652 MI, 238,587 CHF, 46,192 diabe-
tes, and 261,449 respiratory related admissions.
When looking across all seasons (Table 1), El Paso, TX,
Minneapolis, MN, and Seattle, WA, had the lowest PM2.5
concentrations, while Riverside, Bakersfield, and Los
Angeles, CA had the highest concentrations. The lowest
mean concentration of PM2.5 mass, when looking by sea-
son (not shown), was observed in Sacramento in spring
(6.1 μg/m3), well below the National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) of 15 μg/m3, while the highest spring-
time concentration was in Riverside (24 μg/m3). The high-

est winter values were observed in Bakersfield and Fresno,
CA, which were 29.5 and 29.9 μg/m3, respectively.
Species to PM2.5 mass proportions averaged over all com-
munities are presented in Table 2, while community and
season-specific proportions of six selected species are
illustrated in Figure 1. Notably, organic carbon was higher
in all Californian communities in all seasons compared to
other communities; while Ni was higher in Sacramento,
Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Boston in winter and in
Harrisburg and Fresno in spring.
The meta-analysis results are shown in Table 3. Across all
the seasons, for a 10 μg/m3 increase in two-day averaged
PM2.5 concentration we found a 1.89% increase (95% CI:
1.34-2.45) in CVD admissions, a 2.25% increase (95% CI:
1.10-3.42) in MI admissions, a 1.85% increase (95% CI:
1.19-2.51) in CHF admissions, a 2.74% increase (95% CI:
1.30-4.2) in diabetes admissions, and a 2.07% increase
(95% CI: 1.20-2.95) in respiratory admissions. Season-
ally, the percent increase in each cause of admission was
found to be highest in the spring, while it was generally

lower in summer and autumn, except for diabetes which
was high in autumn as well.
We found significant though moderate heterogeneity
among the community-specific effect estimates across all
seasons (I2-statistic p < 0.05) for CVD and MI admissions,
where 33% (CVD) and 24% (MI) of the total variability,
as reported by the I2 statistic, was attributable to between-
community differences (as opposed to stochastic varia-
tion). For CHF, diabetes and respiratory admissions no
significant heterogeneity among the community-specific
effect estimates was found. We report the effect modifica-
tion for all the causes analyzed even though cardiac effects
were the only ones that displayed significant heterogene-
ity.
As we also found a similar inverted U-shaped association
as shown in Franklin [28] between the effect estimates
and season and city mean temperature, we adjusted for
temperature with both a linear and square term in the
meta-regression. Results of effect modification by species-
to-mass proportions, adjusted for temperature, are shown
in Table 4. For each species and cause of admission we
present the P-value for the effect modification, and the
percent increase for an IQR increase in the proportions
with the 95% confidence interval (CI). We only show the
results with a P-value < 0.07.
We found that some species, Fe, NH4+, NO3-, Si, Zn, EC,
and Pb did not result in any effect modification of the
association between PM2.5 and hospital admissions.

Although single species are markers for more complex
particle chemistry, for clarity of presentation we divided
the species in the following groups to represent the gen-
eral categories for which these elements are markers.
Industrial combustion sources: Ni, V, As, Cr, SO42-; Soil
and road dust: Al; Traffic: Br, OC, EC; Sea salt, street salt:
Na+; Soil and industrial sources: Mn; Wood burning and
soil: K.
The association between mass and CVD admissions was
significantly (p = 0.05) modified by Br, Ni, Na+, V and Al.
Specifically, an IQR increase in the proportion of bromine
in PM2.5 mass was associated with an additional 0.81%
increase in CVD admissions (95% CI: 0.2-1.4). Similarly
there was an additional 0.7% (95% CI: 0.01-1.44)
increase for an IQR increase in V, a 0.9% increase (95%
CI: 0.5-1.4) for an interquartile increase in Ni, and a
0.87% increase (95% CI: 0.4-1.4) for an IQR increase in
Na+ (Table 4). The association between PM2.5 and MI was
modified by As, Cr, Mn, OC, Ni, K, and Na+.
Including a combination of species proportions that were
statistically significant in Table 4 and performing a back-
ward elimination, in multi-species models we found that
for CVD the combination of Br and Ni remained statisti-
cally significant (P <= 0.05), with an additional 0.57%
increase in CVD for an IQR increase in Br and an addi-
tional 0.80% increase for an IQR increase in Ni. When we
examined MI, only Ni remained significant.

In a sensitivity analysis, changing the weather specifica-
tion in the first stage to linear showed the same results as
using cubic regression splines.
Central air conditioning (AC) and the SES variables were
not statistically significant in the meta-regression and thus
did not explain any residual heterogeneity in the effect
estimates over and above what temperature and the spe-
cies could explain. Moreover, the magnitude of the modi-
fication by the species proportions did not change
drastically with the inclusion of AC or the SES parameters;
they were only slightly increased or reduced.
Because Na+ and Ni were associated with both CVD and
MI admissions, we examined their concentrations more
carefully and found that levels were consistently higher in
California. For Na+, this may be attributable to the contri-
bution of marine aerosol from the Pacific Ocean. To sup-
port this we present the relationship between Na+
concentrations and wind direction for the Los Angeles
site. As shown by the wind rose (Figure 2), higher levels
were observed when air masses passed over the sea (com-
ing from SW). As a comparison, a similar wind rose was
examined for EC, typically associated with local traffic
(Figure 2), but no wind pattern was observed. Interest-
ingly, the wind roses for Ni and V were similar to Na+, sug-
gesting that wind coming over the ocean also carries
elements often associated with ship emissions (not
shown).
Discussion
In this multi-community study we found a significant
association between PM2.5 mass and both respiratory and
cardiac hospital admissions. These effects were strongest
in spring and were significantly modified by certain chem-
ical components of the mass. The rationale for using spe-
cies-to-mass concentration ratios in the second stage was
that in the first stage the admission risk was estimated per
unit of the total PM2.5 mass, which encompasses all meas-
ured species, and therefore effect modification by the spe-
cies was best expressed on a per unit of PM2.5 mass basis.
One study [24] reported associations between hospital
admissions and PM2.5, but the authors examined different
categories of admissions than us, except for heart failure.
They reported an association of 1.28% (95% CI, 0.78%-
1.78%) increase in risk of heart failure per 10 μg/m3
increase in same-day PM2.5, which is comparable to our
estimate of 1.85% (95% CI: 1.19-2.51) increase in CHF
for the same and previous day average of PM2.5. Similar
results have been found by Peng [43], Metzger [44], and
by Halonen [45]. Bell and co-authors [23] found higher
effects in winter; they used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchi-
cal model which included two interaction terms allowing
both the exposure and the temporal trend to differ by sea-
son. Instead we stratified by season, allowing a more spe-
cific control for season and trend within each community.
Another difference is that the authors included cities with
systematically missing data, which may have several
implications in modelling the time series.
Two recent studies [22] examined the toxicity of PM2.5
chemical composition on hospital admissions. Bell et al
[22] used the method we introduced in Franklin 2008 and
used here; in the second stage however, they didn't take
into account indoor infiltration. We had previously dem-
onstrated [28] that mean seasonal temperature was an
important predictor of the effect of PM2.5 in that city and
season, and since species concentrations can vary with
temperature, an important confounder of assessing the
role of species. We controlled for this in the analyses in
this paper. Bell examined a larger number of communities
and utilized same-day (lag 0) PM2.5 concentrations versus
the mean of lags 0 and 1 in our study. They found associ-
ations with Ni, EC and V while we did not see any effects
for EC. Peng et al [46] used time-series analysis of the
measured (one in three or one in six day) PM2.5 species,
and found significant effects at lag 0 for EC, OC and
ammonium, but not for Ni. Some of these differences may
be due to confounding by ventilation patterns.
Our findings have several important parallels with Frank-
lin and co-authors [28]. For instance, across all admission
types, we found that the elements emitted primarily
through industrial combustion, namely Ni and As, dis-
played the greatest and most consistent effect modifica-
tion. We also found moderate modification by Al, which
was shown to be a strong modifier in the previous study.
The primary differences were that we found that Br and
OC, species often associated with traffic, and Na+, an ion
often associated with marine aerosol, were effect modifi-
ers of several causes of admissions.
We also found a significant effect of PM2.5 on admissions
for diabetes, which, despite the smaller daily counts,
shows the strongest association in all season, spring, and
autumn. As previous studies reported, diabetics might be
particularly susceptible to particles [12-14]. We found that
that SO42- and As were significant effect modifiers, associ-
ated with higher rates of diabetes admissions, whereas OC
was associated with lower rates. This finding are consist-
ent with that of O'Neill et al [13], who reported that SO42-
and particles were associated with impaired flow medi-
ated dilation in diabetic subjects and suggests a continu-
ing concern for coal-derived particles.
As we found that only cardiac effects displayed significant
heterogeneity in the PM2.5-admission effect estimates, we
focus our discussion on CVD and MI.

Cardiac diseases
We found that the association between PM2.5 and CVD
was modified by species related to traffic (Br), ship emis-
sions (Ni and V), marine or street salt (Na+), and soil and
road dust (Al).
General population exposure to Ni is likely from smelters
and oil combustion including domestic heating and ship
emissions as it is a constituent of Residual Oil Fly Ash
(ROFA). Toxicological studies of ROFA have suggested
that its ability to produce cell and tissue injury as well as
stimulate inflammatory response is due to its high transi-
tion metal content. Gao et al [47] found that ROFA Ni
content played a very important role in mediating an
inflammatory response in human lung cells and that it
produced significantly greater effects in comparison to
other particle types. ROFA has been associated with
increased oxidative stress [48], increased susceptibility to
bacterial infections [49,50], and altered heart rate, blood
pressure, and electrocardiograms [51].
Lippmann [33] exposed atherosclerotic prone mice to
concentrated air particles over a six month period. During
periods when Ni was especially high, there was a pro-
nounced acute change in heart rate and heart rate variabil-
ity in those animals. The authors also examined
associations between PM components and mortality in
the National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study
(NMMAPS), and found that daily mortality rates in the 60
cities with recent speciation data were significantly associ-
ated with average Ni and V, but not with other measured
species.
Franklin and coworkers [28] reported that the effect of PM
mass on daily deaths was higher in communities and sea-
sons with particles higher in Ni content, providing addi-
tional support for our findings.
Not much literature exists on the effects of particles rich in
Br, Cr, Mn, As and Na+. Metzger [44] found that CVD vis-
its in Atlanta were associated with NO2, CO, PM2.5, OC,
EC, and oxygenated hydrocarbons, whereas we did not see
effect modification by EC or OC in this analysis. EC and
OC are often highly correlated with PM2.5 mass, making it
difficult to distinguish an EC or OC effect from a mass
effect.
When looking at mortality outcomes, in a time series
analysis in six California counties, Ostro and co-authors
[26] found that PM2.5 mass and several constituents, OC,
NO3-, Fe, K, and Ti were associated with cardiovascular
deaths.
Franklin et al [28] found that Al was a strong modifier of
the PM2.5-mortality effect, yet in this study it only had a
moderate modification effect for CVD and CHF. Their
results were presented for non-accidental mortality and
were not specific to cardiovascular causes. Nevertheless,
plausible biological mechanisms of an inflammatory
response have been found. Soil and road dust containing
Al and Si have been linked with cardio-pulmonary
responses in canines [52] and Becker [53] found that a fac-
tor containing particle Al was significantly related to an
inflammatory response in human epithelial cells.
Myocardial infarctions
We found that species related to traffic (OC) and several
industrial combustion sources (Ni, As, Cr) were modifiers
leading to increased MI admissions. As noted above, As is
a good marker for coal combustion.
Several studies have examined particle components and
MI. Two studies found support for the hypothesis that
exposure to traffic-related air pollution increases the risk
of acute MI [54,55]. Similarly, a study on repolarization
changes and variations in markers of inflammation in
association with ambient PM in a panel of male coronary
artery disease patients, found that traffic-related and com-
bustion-generated particles had stronger adverse health
impact with regard to cardiac effects, and that particles
from different sources induce an acute phase response in
these patients [56].
Limitations
As noted above a key limitation of this study, and all oth-
ers using the US EPA's speciation network, is the ability for

concentrations in ng/m3 and wind direction

one monitor to adequately represent concentrations of
species which are more highly spatially variable. For
instance, Ito et al [57] found that correlations between
concentrations of As, EC and Ni were moderate to low
between closely located STN monitors in the New York
City area. Thus, in general, for spatially variable species, a
greater amount of measurement error could be present
when using a single monitor to represent exposure over an
entire community. Therefore some components will suf-
fer from greater measurement error due to greater spatial
variability. Similarly, while in most locations PM2.5 is
quite homogeneous over the spatial scale of a community
this is not true everywhere. For example, while in Phila-
delphia the spatial variability in PM2.5 is small [58], there
can be large variations in PM2.5 concentrations in Los
Angeles [59]. Another limitation of this study is the use of
diabetes admissions which are more problematic to inter-
pret because these are usually related to complications of
the disease, or other cardiovascular complications.
While the use of seasonal ratios of elements to PM2.5 as
modifiers of the effect of mass on mortality allows us to
gain power by using the daily PM2.5 mass concentrations,
it has some limitations. First, while some of the variation
in the ratios is across cities, and some across seasons
within cities, other variation is across days within season,
and this source of variation is not captured. We believe
this day to day variation around the mean for the season
and city is mostly Berkson error with respect to predicting
a city and season specific PM2.5 slope, and hence reduces
power more than inducing bias. Second, because the var-
iation in the ratios includes variations across cities, there
is the possibility of cross-sectional confounding. In con-
trast to cohort studies, where the outcome is death, and
the confounders are other predictors of mortality, our
meta-regression is different. The outcome is PM2.5 slope,
and hence factors that are predictive of mortality (socio-
economic status, diet, etc) that vary across location are
unlikely to be confounders. The confounders will be other
things besides elemental composition that might predict
differences in PM2.5 slopes. We believe the most impor-
tant one is infiltration rates, and have used mean temper-
ature by season and city as a surrogate for that. Obviously,
it is not a perfect one. Other potential confounders might
be differences in individual susceptibility. However,
because we have variation within city across season, we
believe this approach problem is partially mitigated.
Conclusions
Our study shows that some chemical species significantly
modify the association between PM2.5 and cause-specific
hospital admissions. This important finding illustrates
that mass alone is not a sufficient metric to use when eval-
uating health effects of PM exposure.
One recommendation for decision-makers is that daily
speciation data is needed. It is difficult to analyze the
effect of the PM2.5 mass composition with the data availa-
ble only one day in three or six. Furthermore, future
research aimed to address the issue of the effects of the ele-
ments on, for example, cardiovascular endpoints, could
focus more on study such as chamber or panel study, and
toxicological animal study.
More work is needed in order to better understand the
biological mechanisms of PM components, and to better
direct regulation of particles and sources producing pollu-
tion high in these chemical species.

This work presents a new porous material (SUNSPACE) designed for air particulate matter (PM) capture.
It was developed in answer to the European Commission request of an innovative, affordable, and
sustainable solution, based on design-driven material, to reduce the concentration of air particulate
matter in urban areas. SUNSPACE material was developed from by-products and low-cost materials, such
as silica fume and sodium alginate. Its capability to catch ultraﬁne PM was evaluated by different ad-hoc
tests, considering diesel exhaust fumes and incense smoke PM.
Despite the fact that procedures and materials can be designed for remediation, the high impact on the
environment, for example in terms of natural resources consumption and emissions, are not usually
considered. Instead, we believe that the technologies must be always evaluated in terms of material
embodied energy (EE) and carbon footprint (CF). We deﬁne our approach to solve environment problems
by a sustainable methodology “Azure Chemistry”. For the SUNSPACE synthesis, the multi-criteria deci-
sion analysis was performed to select the best sustainable solution. The emissions and the energies
involved in the synthesis of SUNSPACE material were evaluated with the Azure Chemistry approach,
showing that this could be the best available technology to face the problem of capturing the PM in
urban area.

1. Introduction
The European Environment Agency (“Air quality in Europe d
2016 report d European Environment Agency,” 2016) estimated
that in the 2012e2014 period 50e63% and 85e91% of the urban
population in Europe were exposed to levels of PM10 and PM2.5
(respectively) which exceeded the recommended World Health
Organization (WHO) annual limits (PM10: 20 mg/m3 and PM2.5:
10 mg/m3). In the same report, it was reported that 467,000 pre-
mature deaths in Europe could be attributed to PM2.5 in 2013. PM
pollution due to ﬁne particles (2.5 mg or less) is particularly harmful
since ﬁne PM can penetrate human bronchi and lungs owing to the
small particle size (Harrison and Yin, 2000).
The number of publications per year devoted to “air pollution”
problems and solutions is growing from 1960 (Fig. 1) and the trend
is still growing, while the number of publications about “ﬁlter” and
“air” is quite constant in the last ten years (the data were obtained
by SCOPUS). This may suggest that the technologies for PM ﬁltra-
tion is set and few researches are devoted to ﬁnd new approaches
to face the problem. Indeed, several techniques are already assessed
for ﬁltration (Liu et al., 2017a).
Air pollution control systems also concern anthropogenic
emissions reduction (such as CO2, SO2, NOx) such as gas capture
(Zhang et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2018).
Possible, emerging nano-ﬁbers materials, to reduce PM, may be
produced in the future at accessible costs (Liu et al., 2015, 2017c;
Singh et al., 2017). Since it is urgent to develop low-cost technol-
ogies to promote the air quality in urban areas, the European
Commission encourages the research in the ﬁeld of new materials,
devoted to reducing the concentration of particulate matter in ur-
ban areas. The aim was to highlight innovative, affordable, and
sustainable solutions, based on design-driven materials.
The research presented in this paper started in 2015 by using the
multi-criteria decision analysis (Jahan et al., 2016) to support the
most suitable synthesis strategy able to produce a new material to
be used for the PM reduction in the urban area.

The new proposed material is designed to reduce the PM pre-
sent in the urban air by using green and sustainable materials,
process, and technologies (as formulated in the Green chemistry).
We called this chemistry approach that want to link Green Chem-
istry and Remediation “Azure Chemistry”: the goal is to restore or
reconstruct the ecosystems by sustainable solutions in terms of
energy, materials and emissions. Azure Chemistry concerns, for
example, carbon dioxide sequestration, PM pollution reduction,
waste minimisation, and energy neutrality. It requires low-energy
paths, manufacturing and technologies reducing the use of non-
renewable resources, and in which wastes and by-products are
employed. Overall, Azure Chemistry approach must minimize the
global impact of the remediation processes. Indeed, literature re-
ports several examples of declared low-cost materials, synthesised
for instance starting from wastes and by-products (Nayak and Pal,
2017; Silva et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2016). However, the declared
sustainability of these new proposed materials is rarely demon-
strated and quantiﬁed.
The most promising new materials for air ﬁlters, e.g. poly-
ethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and polystyrene
(PS), are petroleum-based materials (Khalid et al., 2017; Liu et al.,
2015). This makes the environmental costs in their production
high. Indeed, the emissions associated with the production of these
polymer materials can range from 30 to 150 kg-CO2eq.
Even when biomaterials are used to make ﬁlters (as for example
soy protein isolate and bacterial cellulose) (Liu et al., 2017b), the
synthesis requires toxic chemicals, thermal treatments and refrig-
eration, that makes ﬁlters production not suitable to solve the PM
problem of the urban areas. Moreover, the ﬁlter regeneration is
usually not considered, making the material substitution the most
common practice to replace exhaust ﬁlters, triggering a secondary
environment pollution.
Several materials are reported in the literature and databases
and they can be grouped in two categories (Jahan et al., 2016):
traditional and, more recently developed, engineered materials
(see Fig. 2). Engineered materials have been developed to guar-
antee functional and structural characteristics that cannot be pro-
vided by a single component alone. Two main distinct strategies
design engineering materials:
1. conventional design strategy that aims to obtain materials with
a uniform and homogeneous structure.
2. newly developed design strategy in which the goal is to disperse
the constituents by a controlled and selectively heterogeneous
way. By this approach, materials for niche applications have
been obtained (Jahan et al., 2016).
By the second approach, it is possible to create porous materials
that combine desirable properties of organic polymers (ﬂexibility
and elasticity) with those of inorganic solids (rigidity and chemical
resistance) (Zou et al., 2008). Porous materials are used for trapping
and encapsulation functional biomolecules, enzymes, drugs, and
nutrients (Kim et al., 2015). Various methods have been used to
obtain pore sizes control, as speciﬁc precursors for nano-casting or
variable size surfactant templates (Suib, 2017).
The new material for air particulate trapping must have a wide
range of pores sizes, from few nanometers (nm) to some microns
(mm) to allow the capture of all sizes of PM. In particular, pores in
the nanometers range are necessary for the trapping of the most
dangerous smallest PM.
Indeed, these particles contain toxic substances such as heavy
metals,
PAHs,
polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxins
and
di-
benzofurans and polychlorinated biphenyls, making them more
hazardous and carcinogenic (Dzier_zanowski et al., 2011; Silverman
et al., 2012).
For this reason, the newly developed material performances
have been assessed in trapping of diesel exhaust and incense smoke
PM. Indeed, diesel exhaust is enriched in ultraﬁne particles
(<0.1 mm in diameter) (Williams, 2011) and incense burning emits
particles with the mean particle diameter of about 100 nm (Ji et al.,
2010; Tirler and Settimo, 2015).
2. Material design and synthesis strategies
To meet the Azure Chemistry requirements and reduce the
global environmental impact of the new proposed material, we
followed these principles:
- use low-energy materials by selecting nontoxic low-cost mate-
rials
and
by-products
(material
requiring
low
extraction
energies);
-use processes that need low energy. The selection of the ma-
terial must be tightly coupled with the choice of a low-cost
production process;
- make long-lasting and excellent products that can be easily
regenerated;
- design products with a minimum amount of material. To be
functional the new material must be in contact with the air and
should be applied as a coating to whatever surface;
- quantify the sustainability of the new proposed material, in
terms of materials, energy, and emissions.
A template process was developed to allow the formation of
connected pores, which are mandatory to allow the PM-capturing
and entrapment by a new synthesis of mesoporous materials
involving the cross-linking of functional groups. No standard
templates have been used and material decomposition process
(made at low temperatures) generating gas was applied.
By this approach, a new porous material named SUNSPACE
(SUStainable materials Synthesized from by-products and Alginates
for Clean air and better Environment) has been obtained, based on
sodium alginate, calcium iodate (or calcium chloride), and silica
fume. Sodium bicarbonate is employed to generate CO2 by thermal
decomposition at low temperatures (60e70 C) and to produce the
pores. Sodium alginate is a natural and low-cost polysaccharide,
that can be extracted from various species of brown seaweeds
(Ikeda et al., 2000). It has extensively been employed in different
applications in view of its fascinating properties, such as gelling,
ﬁlm forming, emulsion capabilities, and low price (Augst et al.,
2006). Its colloidal property makes possible the formation of an
insoluble gel through gelation with calcium cations (Johnson et al.,
1997; Yang et al., 2016). Silica fume, a by-product derived from

ferrosilicon or silicon metal alloy processing (Rodella et al., 2017)
was used in the preparation of the new material. To react with
sodium alginate, calcium iodate is generally used. However, cal-
cium chloride was also successfully tested.
To propose SUNSPACE as a coating (as a plaster on a wall or roof
tiles) to reduce the PM in urban area, the sustainability of the
material was assessed. Several factors must be evaluated: the ma-
terial availability, the manufacturing process, the energy con-
sumption, the emissions, and the recycling options (Elza Bontempi,
2017a).
In this context, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is one of the most used
methods to evaluate the environmental pressures of the new
product. However, because of the large variety of materials and
processes, the complexity of the emissions and boundary condi-
tions, LCA may require handling a large number of data and many
calculations. A simple approach, accounting for example energies
and emissions involved in the synthesis of a material (Elza
Bontempi, 2017a), was recently proposed and can be applied
based on the “embodied energy” (EE), deﬁned as the energy
required to produce 1 kg of the material, starting from ores and
feedstock (Ashby, 2012). The material synthesis also involves the
production of greenhouse gases (kg-CO2eq) released into the at-
mosphere (Ashby, 2012), deﬁned as the “CO2 footprint” (CF). In the
recently proposed approach, one of us (Elza Bontempi, 2017b)
introduced a new simpliﬁed method to quantify the sustainability
of the material in respect, for example, to a natural resource, only
based on the comparison of embodied energy (EE) and carbon
footprint (CF). It was also shown (E. Bontempi, 2017c) that the
world materials production is correlated to the materials embodied
energy (and CO2 footprint), and a relationship of the material de-
mand and the energies and emissions involved in its production
was demonstrated.
3. Experimental
3.1. Synthesis
Sodium alginate (CAS number: 9005-38-3, viscosity c ¼ 1% wa-
ter @ 25 C 5.0e40.0 cps), calcium iodate (Ca(IO3)2, CAS number:
7789-80-2), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, CAS number 14455e8,
99.8% w/w), and calcium chloride (CaCl2, CAS number 10043-52-
4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Conventional (grey) and
white silica fume (industrial by-products derived from ferrosilicon
and silicon metal alloy processing) were kindly provided by Met-
alleghe SPA, Brescia, Italy. Double deionised water (ddH2O, Milli-
pore DirectQ-5 puriﬁcation system) was also used.
The synthesis was performed at room temperature (RT) by a
process adapted from (Brandes et al., 2014): 0.6 g of gel-former
(sodium alginate) were dissolved in 25 ml of solvent (ddH2O) and
mixed till complete dissolution. Then 1 g of cross-linker (calcium

nate, the solution under continuous stirring. In these conditions, a

gel was formed. 17.88 g of silica fume (corresponding to 72% w/w of
solid content) was added, and ﬁnally, 5 g of sodium bicarbonate was
thoroughly mixed to the slurry.
The obtained slurry was then warmed on a heating plate at
60e70 C for 1 h. The presence of Ca2þ ions (due to the cross-linker)
and the annealing allowed the formation and consolidation of the
hybrid material (Zanoletti et al., 2018). Also, thermal treatment
promoted the sodium bicarbonate decomposition and the conse-
quent release of CO2 for pore formation.
Porous disks with a diameter of 2.3 cm and a thickness of 5 mm
were obtained. They were rinsed with ddH2O and dried at ambient
conditions and then used in the tests.
3.2. Characterization
X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was realised by means an
Empyrean diffractometer (PANalytical, Netherlands). The XRD was
performed in using Cu Ka (l ¼ 1.5406 A) radiation, operated at
40 kV to 40 mA. Spectra were recorded by a parallel-plate colli-
mated proportional Xe detector with a nickel large-b ﬁlter.
The morphology of porous samples was investigated using a
ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) LEO 1525,
Gemini model; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany. The electron
beam was set at 3e5 keV energy and the samples were attached to
metallic stub via carbon glue, to reduce charging effect due to the
interaction of electron beam with the specimens.
Nitrogen (N2) physisorption measurements were made by a
Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyser, at the liquid nitrogen temper-
ature. Before the analysis, 500 mg of each sample was degassed at
100 C overnight.
To verify the capability of SUNSPACE to trap air particulate
matter, three ad-hoc tests were realised.
In the ﬁrst test, SUNSPACE was exposed for 15 min to exhaust
fume of a diesel car. It was placed at about 15 cm distance from the
emission source. For this experiment, SUNSPACE was synthesised
by using white silica fume. This allowed obtaining a white porous
material, for better highlighting of the colour change due to the
captured of the PM. After the test, SUNSPACE sample was washed
by distilled water, to remove the trapped particles, and it was
maintained at laboratory conditions (22 C and 1 atm) for 1 day to
dry.
In the second test, a SUNSPACE sample with a surface of about
20 cm2 was exposed to the incense smoke emissions: incense stick
was put on a working bench and the sample was placed on a holder
at about 30 cm distance from the particle source.
In the third test, a SUNSPACE sample with a surface area of 4.15
(±0.01) cm2 was exposed to the emissions of six incense sticks
(burned in succession). The experimental conditions were the same
of those reported in the second test.
The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) microprobe
(Link Pentafet Oxford mod 7060) was used to investigate the
elemental composition of SUNSPACE surface before and after the
tests.
The colorimetric analysis was performed by a UV-VIS Spec-
troscopy - Color Measurement Minolta CM 2600 d. Colorimetry is a
spectroscopic technique, developed to deﬁne a colour. To deﬁne a
precise colour, a colour space is introduced by one channel for
Luminance (lightness) (L) and two-colour channels (a and b). L
ranges from 0 (black) to 100 (white). Measurements can be made
with the specular component of light (SCI modality), or without a
specular component of light (SCE modality).
METTLER TOLEDO XS3DU model balance operating at 12 V and
150 mA was employed to weight the samples. ASTM D6552 e 06
(Standard Practice for Controlling and Characterizing Errors in
Weighing Collected Aerosols) was followed.
To reduce errors due to the humidity, SUNSPACE samples were
conditioned, at 105 C, for 6 h before the tests.
The temperature of the room was 22 C and the relative hu-
midity was 35% (it was constant within ±5% RH, in accord to ASTM
D6552 e 06 speciﬁcations).
The data for EE and CF of the materials used in the sample
preparation were obtained from CES Selector 2016 (Granta, 2016).
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Material characterisation
N2 physisorption measurements at the liquid nitrogen temper-
ature have been made to investigate the textural properties of
SUNSPACE and the pores dimensions less than 200 nm. Large
mesopores and macropores are observed (Zanoletti et al., 2018).
Notably, pore size distributions calculated from the desorption
branch of the isotherms show relative maxima (at 15 and 30 nm)
smaller with respect to those calculated from the correspondent
adsorption branch (100e150 nm). This suggests that ink-bottle
shaped pores are present, as conﬁrmed by the hysteresis loops
observed in the N2 physisorption isotherms (Zanoletti et al., 2018).
PM capture can be obtained by adsorption of the particles in the
pores. Indeed, ink-bottle shaped pores are the most suitable pores
to act as a PM capture for ultra-ﬁne and ﬁne particles, since when
the PM enters in the pores are trapped, due to pore shape and
dimensions.
The XRD pattern of SUNSPACE sample is shown in Fig. 3: The
spectra were collected on the porous materials synthesised with
the two different cross-linkers: calcium iodate or calcium chloride.
A large halo in both spectra is due to the amorphous silica phase
present in the SUNSPACE. Crystalline peaks can be attributed to
calcite, cristobalite, and sodium chloride. The two peaks, at about
32.4 and 18.2 may be attributed respectively to a calcium silicate
phase and to nahcolite phase.
SEM images of SUNSPACE material at different magniﬁcations
are shown in Fig. 4. Samples synthesised with the two different
cross-linkers, i.e. calcium iodate (a, b) or calcium chloride (c, d) are
shown. In both cases, it appears that the porous material is formed
by agglomerated spherical particles. The spherical particles di-
mensions are different, generally lower than 300 nm (Fig. 4b). EDXS
results (not reported) revealed that these samples are mainly
composed by oxygen (about 50%) and silicon (about 33e39%). Trace

concentration of the following elements: Cl, Na, K, I, and Mg are
detected.
4.2. Evaluation of material capability to trap air particulate matter
As described in the experimental section, three ad-hoc tests
were realised to evaluate the SUNSPACE capacity in PM trapping.
Fig. 5 reports the images of SUNSPACE material before (a) and
after 15 min the exposition (b) to exhaust fume of diesel car
emissions and Table 1 reports results of EDXS analysis of the two
samples. It is shown that the amount of C is much higher after the

SUNSPACE exposition to diesel fume. EDXS analysis, made on the
sample before and after the exposition, revealed that exposed
sample contains a signiﬁcant amount (more than 23% in weight) of
carbon in its surface. Indeed, diesel exhaust particles contain a
carbon core, which is generally coated by polyaromatic hydrocar-
bons, quinones and metals (Williams, 2011).
The SUNSPACE exposed sample was washed by distilled water to
remove entrapped particles, and it was maintained at laboratory
conditions (22 C and 1 atm) for 1 day to dry. The colorimetric
analysis was performed on the porous sample before and after the
exposition. The same analysis was performed after washing the
sample.
The results of colorimetric analysis made on SUNSPACE mate-
rials are reported in Table 2. These data show that SUNSPACE
characteristic color becomes darker (L changes from about 77 to
about 44) after the test and it was regenerated just by washing
(only b coordinate resulted slightly different in respect to the raw
material). This test demonstrated that SUNSPACE can trap air PM,
and the material regeneration can occur just by rainfall washing.
The second and the third tests were realized to quantify the
amount of ultra-ﬁne PM that can be adsorbed by SUNSPACE. On this
purpose, PM was generated by burning incense sticks.
The smoke incense PM particles have a broad size distribution
from <300 nm to >10 nm, with the majority of particles being
<1 mm (Liu et al., 2015).
A porous sample with a surface of 20 cm2 was used. After the
incense stick burning, the mass of porous material increment of
0.028 (±0.002) g corresponds to the amount of air particulate
matters produced by a single incense stick (W. Tirler and Settimo,
2015). As a consequence, we concluded that SUNSPACE sample
trapped about all the ultra-ﬁne emitted particle.
For the third experiment, a SUNSPACE sample with a surface
area of 4.15 (±0.01) cm2 was used. This test was carried out to
evaluate the maximum amount of ultra-ﬁne PM (with the diameter
less than 1 mm) that can be trapped by a ﬁx SUNSPACE surface area.
The experiments were realised by burning six incense stick in
sequence. After burning each stick, the sample was weighted. In
accord with ASTM D6552 e 06 speciﬁcations, the tests were dis-
regarded when the humidity changed more than 5%.
The surfaces of the material before and after the test are very
different (see Fig. 6). Indeed, the surface of the sample after the test
appeared coated by a black layer, even if the macro-pores
morphology is similar.
Fig. 7 shows the SEM images of the SUNSPACE sample after the
test: the surface is covered by a homogeneous coating layer, as
already highlighted in Fig. 6. However, the pores present in the raw
sample (Fig. 4) cannot be seen and the morphology of the material
is different. The lateral surfaces that were not directly exposed re-
sults not entirely covered by a continuous layer and the agglom-
erated spherical particles can still be seen.
The behaviour of incense smoke PM followed by particles ag-
gregation onto nano-ﬁbres of a ﬁlter was already reported in the
literature (Liu et al., 2015). However, this is the ﬁrst time that a
similar aggregation level (a continuous layer was formed) of in-
cense smoke is reported. Besides, the change in the SUNSPACE
color, after the incense smoke capture, is not clear, and by washing
a yellow solution is obtained. As for the previous test, we concluded
that SUNSPACE, if used as a plaster in urban area, can be regenerate
by rainfall.
Table 3 reports the EDXS analysis performed on the surface
covered by the incense smoke: it results that the main detected
elements are Ca, O, and N (>than 6%). On the contrary, Si contri-
bution is not detectable. This means that the probe does not reach
the porous material. Indeed, these results are in accord with the
composition of the incense smoke reported in ref (Liu et al., 2015).
Table 4 reports the mass of SUNSPACE material (initial value
0.843 ± 0.001 g), evaluated after each single incense stick burning.
It results that this material adsorbed till to 2407 (±581) mg/cm2 of
air particulate matter particles, with dimensions lower than 1 mm.
This value corresponds to about 24 (±6) g/m2 of air particulate
matter. This means that employing SUNSPACE to cover for example
roof tiles, for a city like New York, where roofs globally occupy a
surface of 92 millions of m2, about 2200 tons of air particulate
matter may be trapped only by the roofs. Also, the material
regeneration by rainfall can allow increasing the amount of PM

4.3. Consideration about material sustainability
Fig. 8 shows the EE and CF of SUNSPACE. The data for some
natural materials, ceramic, and composites are indicated. The en-
ergies and emissions involved in the production of materials used
for air ﬁlters, e.g. polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyamide
(PA), polystyrene (PS), and glass are also displayed.
The energies and emissions involved in the SUNSPACE synthesis
are less than 3 MJ/kg and 1 kg/kg respectively, making this material
the best choice in accord with the Azure Chemistry approach.
Indeed, because of the main material used to obtain SUNSPACE is a
by-product, the energies involved in its synthesis are comparable to
energies required to produce natural materials. In particular, it re-
sults that SUNSPACE can be considered similar to cement regarding
material sustainability, making this material very promising for
building applications.
SUNSPACE is designed to be regenerated, after PM capture, only
by rainfall. The discharge water can be collected by the urban
wastewater collection system (for example with wastewater
deriving from street washing) to be conveyed at the urban waste-
water treatment plant, with no additional impacts.
5. Conclusions
This work reports the characteristics of the ﬁrst material
expressly designed for air PM capture in urban area. SUNSPACE
material was realised following the basic principles of the green
sustainable chemistry, that we deﬁned “Azure Chemistry”: In this
approach, the strategies for remediation must evaluate their envi-
ronmental impact by means of quantitative parameters, as the
“embodied energy” (EE), and the “CO2 footprint” (CF). Therefore,
the key of this vision is to evaluate the global environmental impact
of the remediation approach, though, for example, materials
selection.
By this approach, we demonstrated that SUNSPACE material is
effective in ultra-ﬁne PM trapping, and its capability to be naturally

Abstract Particulate matter (PM) is a complex mixture
of particles that changes over time and from place to
place; however, most PM is caused by the fuel combus-
tion of motor vehicles and industry. PM is associated
with acute and chronic illnesses, such as pulmonary and
cardiovascular diseases. Medellín is one of the most
polluted cities in Latin America. Therefore, the physi-
cochemical characterization of its PM is necessary to
understand its composition and effect on human health.
In this study, PM was characterized by scanning elec-
tron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spec-
troscopy (EDS) analysis, Fourier infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), inductivity-coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES), and thermogravimetric analy-
sis (TGA) in order to evaluate its morphology and
chemical composition. The SEM of the PM exhibited
primary particles and agglomerates. The size of the
particles ranged between 0.056 and 4.5 μm. The EDS
revealed elements such as carbon, silicon, calcium, lead,
and iron. Furthermore, carbon monoxide, carbon diox-
ide, and carbonyl and aliphatic functional groups were
observed by means of FTIR. Additionally, weight losses
associated with volatile matter and elemental carbon
were identified in the TGA analysis. The TGA and
FTIR confirmed the presence of fuel and lubricant
traces. Subsequently, lead was selected among the most
common components in the PM in order to conduct an
in silico study into its effect on ventricular activity. Lead
showed a pro-arrhythmic effect by shortening the dura-
tion of the action potential under normal electrophysio-
logical conditions, which could be associated with car-
diovascular diseases.

1 Introduction
Particulate matter (PM) is a mixture of solid and liquid
particles of inorganic and organic substances that are
commonly found suspended in the air (Perrino et al.
2015). PM is commonly classified into coarse, fine,
and ultrafine particles depending on its aerodynamic
diameter. Coarse particles have an aerodynamic diame-
ter between 2.5 and 10 μm (PM10); fine particles, equal
to or less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5); and ultrafine particles,
less than 0.1 μm (PM0.1) (Mirowsky et al. 2014; Huang
et al. 2017; U.S. EPA. 2018). The particle size of PM is
directly related to its potential harmful effects on human
health. Coarse PM can penetrate and lodge deep inside
the lungs; however, it is not as harmful to human health
as PM2.5. Fine PM can cross the pulmonary barrier and
enter the blood system with adverse health effects (Di
Novi 2013; Xing et al. 2016). Other problems caused by

PM include environmental issues such as air acidity
(Wu and Zhang 2018), low visibility (Wang et al.
2018), and material damage (Al-Thani et al. 2018).
PM sources can be either human (anthropogenic) or
natural (non-anthropogenic). Anthropogenic sources in-
clude (diesel and petrol) combustion engines, solid fuels
(heavy oil and coal), and the manufacture of cement,
ceramics, and bricks, among others. Accordingly, the
chemical characteristics of PM change from place to
place. Nevertheless, its most common chemical ele-
ments include magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium,
copper, lead, and nickel, as well as other compounds
such as aromatic hydrocarbons and elemental and or-
ganic carbon (Dickerson et al. 2016; Moreira-Lopez
et al. 2016; Müller et al. 2017).
The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimat-
ed that fine PM causes around 4.6 million premature
deaths per year worldwide (World Health Organization
2019). People living in low- and middle-income coun-
tries disproportionately experience the burden of air
pollution. Numerous epidemiological and clinical stud-
ies indicate that PM in air pollution is strongly associ-
ated with higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, such as
arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke,
vascular dysfunction, hypertension, and atherosclerosis
(Di Novi 2013; Chin 2015). Bañeras et al. (2018) found
that the daily rate of hospital admissions for ST segment
elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated
with increases in concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, lead,
and NO2 in the air. In turn, Xia et al. (2018) reported that
long-term exposures to PM10 are positively associated
with subclinical atherosclerosis in middle-aged adults.
Therefore, PM size and chemical composition are im-
portant to determine the source and the health risk that
particulate matter represents for exposed individuals
(Davy et al. 2012).
Elements such as calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), iron (Fe),
titanium (Ti), and aluminum (Al) have been detected at
PM sampling sites in urban as well as sub-urban areas
(Bozkurt et al. 2018; Genga et al. 2018). In general, Si,
Al, Ca, and Ti are the most common elements in the
Earth’s crust, products of soil dust, and quarry exploita-
tion (Kholdebarin et al. 2015). However, heavy metals
such as chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd),
lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) are also present in PM,
mostly due to anthropogenic activities (Vimercati et al.
2017; Esposito et al. 2019). Lead is one of the most
harmful heavy metals for human health (Wani et al.
2015; Lu et al. 2019). Menke et al. (2006) measured
the blood lead level (BLL) of 13,946 individuals in the
USA, recruited between 1988 and 1994, for more than
12 years. They observed an association between BLL
and myocardial infarction and stroke mortality. This
association was evident at levels ≥2 μm/dL. Moreover,
Lustbeg and Silbergeld (2015) found that individuals
with a BLL from 20 to 29 μm/dL experienced increased
circulatory and cardiovascular mortality. Additionally,
lead is associated with an increase in blood pressure,
heart rate, and heart rate variability (Lim et al. 2017).
The physicochemical features of PM are directly
related to its emission source; as a result, PM produced
by diesel vehicles, gasoline vehicles, and natural emis-
sions differs significantly. In that sense, the PM in each
region in the world also exhibits specific features asso-
ciated with the type of emission sources of its particles.
Therefore, the local characterization of PM is of great
importance to understand its effects depending on the
particularities of the region. Several studies around the
world have examined the correlation between (1) parti-
cle size and chemical composition of PM and (2) health
risks. Nevertheless, the characterization of this type of
particulate matter has not been widely explored, which
makes correlating its properties with real observed
harmful effects more difficult. Specifically, real particle
size should be further investigated because it is one of
the most important characteristics of this material, and
most of the reports are just based in the filters weight at
the monitoring stations, assuming the size of all the
collected material. Some alternatives to fill this gap are
techniques such as scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), which can be used to reliably evaluate the
morphology and particle size distribution of PM
(Babick et al. 2016). In addition, in the conventional
extractive methods employed in the literature, fibers are
removed from the filters without any further separation
from the PM or quantifying said material in the analysis
(De Kok et al. 2005; Škarek et al. 2007).
Medellín is the second largest city in Colombia, with
a population of about 2.5 million inhabitants, and its
geographical conditions make air pollution worse be-
cause the mountain ranges that surround the city cause
pollutants to remain longer in the atmosphere (Gomez
et al. 2011). Several reports between 2003 and 2015
have shown that, in most of the monitoring stations in
said city, the PM10 levels exceeded WHO limits in
countless occasions. Arias-Valencia et al. (2010) re-
vealed that Medellín experiences an epidemic of mor-
tality due to diseases associated with air pollution; there
Water Air Soil Pollut (2020) 231: 508
Page 2 of 14
508
are about 3000 deaths per year for that reason, out of
which 1500 are related to toxic components in the air.
Between 2012 and 2016, PM2.5 concentrations
exceeded WHO recommendations, and, even worse,
they show no sign of decreasing (López et al. 2017).
However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the
physicochemical composition of the PM obtained in
Medellín has not been studied in detail so far. In this
paper, PM collected in a monitoring station in Medellín
is physicochemically and morphologically character-
ized in depth, and the results are used in an in silico
study to evaluate its effect on ventricular action
potential.
2 Methods
2.1 Sample Collection
Particulate matter was collected at a certified monitoring
station inside the premises of the University of
Medellín, Colombia (6°13’N,75°36’O). The University
is located southwest of the city, which is considered an
urban area. In addition, the sampling point is near a
quarry, and the sampling equipment was located on
the roof of a building. The particulate matter was col-
lected for 24 h using a quartz microfiber filter
(Whatman). The PM was sampled every 4 days between
October and November in 2018 using a PM10 Size
Selective Sampling Inlet (RFPS 1287–063) provided
by Staplex. The volumetric flow was adjusted between
1.038 m3/min and 1.258 m3/min, as per Method IO-2.1
established by the US EPA (U.S. EPA. 1999). After the
sampling period, the filter was desiccated for 24 h in a
desiccator containing silica gel (U.S. EPA. 2016).
2.2 Particulate Matter Extraction
The particulate matter captured during the sampling was
extracted from the filters by the Soxhlet method, which
is commonly employed for the extraction of particulate
matter (Dallarosa et al. 2005; Cavanagh et al. 2009;
Masih et al. 2010). The filters were cut into fragments
and placed in Soxhlet equipment. The extraction process
lasted 24 h at 110 °C. A mixture of deionized water (<
18 MΩ·m) and acetone (Chemi, purity >99.5%) in a 1:2
ratio was used in order to extract polar and no polar
components from the filter (Obot et al. 2002; Roper
et al. 2015). Afterward, the extract was concentrated
using a rotary evaporator and dried at 80 °C in an oven
overnight.
2.3 Physicochemical Characterization
The volatile fraction and elemental carbon in the
particulate matter were characterized by thermogravi-
metric analysis (TGA) using a TA Instruments SDT-
Q600 Simultaneous TGA/DSC with a heating pro-
gram in a nitrogen atmosphere, initially, and a ramp
of 3 °C per minute up to 450 °C. Subsequently, the
program was changed to an air atmosphere and a ramp
of 5 °C per minute up to 500 °C. Finally, an isother-
mal process was conducted for 70 min (Mustafi et al.
2010). Functional groups in the PM were analyzed by
infrared spectroscopy with an IRTracer-100 (FTIR)
spectrophotometer with wavelengths between 500
and 4000 cm−1 by the attenuated total reflection
(ATR) method. The size and shape of the PM were
determined using a JEOL JSM-7100F (FE-SEM)
scanning electron microscope with a voltage of
15 kV and a working distance between 4 and
10 mm. The open-source software Image J was used
to measure the diameter of more than 550 particles in
approximately 100 micrographs. The measurement of
the particles size with the software can be divided into
two steps, in the first part the calibration of the SEM
image in order to correlate the image dimensions in
pixel to physical dimensions is performed. In the
second part, the particles are measured by using the
tools of the software, since some particles are not
totally spherical, the Feret’s diameter is employed to
calculate their size (Mazzoli and Favoni 2012). Like-
wise, the raw filters were also studied by FE-SEM
before being used and after particulate matter collec-
tion. The chemical composition of the PM was ob-
tained by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) using
an X-MaxN SDD detector (available from Oxford
Instruments) attached to a scanning electron micro-
scope with a voltage of 20 kV; for that purpose, more
than 20 analyses were performed. In addition, heavy
metals were determined and quantified using a Ther-
mo Fisher Scientific™iCAP™7000 Series ICP-OES
(Inductivity Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spec-
trometer) as per the 23rd edition of APHA Standard
Methods 3120 A and 3120 B. The PM characteriza-
tion was performed using all the material extracted
from all the filters after the washing process.

2.4 Model of the Effects of Lead on Ventricular Action
Potential
Based on a study into myocytes, which showed that lead
(Pb) affects the cardiac electrical activity by blocking the
L-type calcium channel (ICaL) (Bernal et al. 1997), we
used Hill’s equation to fit the concentration-response re-
lationship of the ICaL current block caused by lead. There-
fore, the fraction of block (bPb) is described in Eq. (1):
bPb ¼
1
1 þ IC50
D

h
ð1Þ
where IC50 is the half maximal inhibitory concentration,
which is equal to 152 nM, a value found by Bernal et al.
(1997) in ventricular myocytes; D is the lead concentra-
tion; and h is the Hill coefficient, where a value of 1
indicates a completely independent binding. The factor
(1–bPb) was included in the ICaL equation of the O’Hara-
Rudy-CiPA ventricular single-cell model (Dutta et al.
2017). Such model was used to simulate the human
endocardial ventricular action potential. The publicly
available software CellML OpenCOR® was used to sim-
ulate a train of 1000 beats applied at a basic cycle length of
1000 ms. The Euler method was implemented with a time
step of 0.001 ms and lead concentrations from 0 to
1000 nM. The ionic currents and action potential duration
(APD), at a 90% repolarization (APD90), were measured
on the 1000th beat.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization and Real Particle Size Calculation
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermal analysis (DTG) of the samples are shown in
Fig. 1. An initial weight loss of 57.64% can be identified
between 100 and 440 °C (maximum peak at 242 °C). This
weight loss corresponds to humidity and water adsorbed
by the material, and it could also be related to the loss of
volatile material, since the volatilization of organic com-
pounds is evident at temperatures below 462 °C. A second
thermal event between 462 and 500 °C represents a
weight loss of 4.39%, which is associated with elemental
carbon. The remaining weight after the analysis (37.97%)
is related to inorganic residues mainly composed of metal
oxides and filter residues.
Volatile matter has been typically emitted by sev-
eral anthropogenic sources, such as the degradation of
fossil fuels and lubricant oil from motor vehicles
(Chien et al. 2009; Santos et al. 2017a). In turn,
elemental carbon is emitted during the incomplete
combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning. How-
ever, in order to consider elemental carbon to be an
indicator of PM produced by burning fossil fuels in
the environment, the geographical space where the
sample was taken should be taken into account
(Schauer 2003). The University of Medellín is located
in a residential area, where the possibility of burning
biomass is minimal. For that reason, the elemental

carbon found in the samples collected there could be
mainly attributed to vehicles.
Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the PM, which
were obtained in order to evaluate the vibration of the
functional groups in the sample. The absorption peak at
around 3412 cm−1 is associated with O-H stretching
vibration (Gipson et al. 2015). The band from
2845 cm−1 to 2919 cm−1 corresponds to symmetric
and asymmetric C-H stretching vibration of the mainly
aliphatic CH2 group (Anil et al. 2014). The stretching
vibration of C=O appears between 1375 cm−1 and
1630 cm−1 (Ge et al. 2017). The peak at 1450 cm−1
may be attributed to CO2 vibrations (Roy et al. 2015).
The bands between 1080 cm−1 and 1130 cm−1 are due to
C-O stretching vibrations (Kharazmi et al. 2015;
Hamzah et al. 2018). Finally, the vibrations at around
1870 cm−1, 726 cm−1, and 811 cm−1 can be associated
with Si-O, Si-H, and Si-O-Si, respectively.
The TGA analysis revealed weight losses related to
humidity, unburned fuel, motor oil, and silicon fibers.
These results are in agreement with the FTIR due to the
presence of the OH vibration of water and carbonyl
(C=O), CO, and aliphatic C-H groups, which are asso-
ciated with unburned fuel and motor oil (Correa and
Arbilla 2008; Angelovi et al. 2013; Kupareva et al.
2013; Popovicheva et al. 2015). The primary source of
anthropogenic CO2 is the combustion of fossil fuels and
industrial activities (Goldstein et al. 2017); in particular,
fuels are a complex mixture of chemicals, several of
them toxic and carcinogenic, which could have a strong
impact on human health (Madanhire and Mbohwa
2016). For instance, the exposure to lubricating oils
can cause skin and eye irritation (Hilpert et al. 2015).
As mentioned above, different particle sizes pose a
problem for PM classification and have diverse effects
on human health. However, studies into PM do not
usually report particle size, which is assumed based on
the type of collector used in air monitoring stations.
Figure 3(a) and (b) show representative SEM micro-
graphs of the PM in the filter before the extraction
process. Figure 3(c) is a micrograph of the material
obtained after the extraction process, and Fig. 3(d) pre-
sents a clean quartz microfiber filter before use for
comparison. Particles attached to the fibers can be ob-
served in micrographs (a) and (b). In all the cases,
semispherical particles with a smooth surface morphol-
ogy were found, in addition to a high particle size
distribution. Micrograph (c) reveals the presence of
Fig. 2 Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) of PM after
the washing process

508
particles and multiple detached filter fibers after the
washing process. Fiber remnants are unavoidable after
the washing process, and additional filtering is neces-
sary to remove them.
The average diameter of the particles in the SEM
images was measured by ImageJ software. The particle
size distribution was first divided into three groups, and
the results are shown in three histograms (Fig. 4).
Figure 4(a) and (b) presents the size distributions of
ultrafine (< 0.1 μm) and fine (between 0.1 and
2.5 μm) particles in the sample, respectively. Both fine
and ultrafine PM are considered PM2.5. In turn, the size
distribution of coarse particles (> 2.5 μm) is detailed in
Fig. 4(c). The ultrafine particles exhibit an average size
of 0.056 μm, while the average sizes of fine and coarse
particles are 1.84 and 4.5 μm, respectively.
Considering that the equipment used in this study
was a certified PM10 collector, two important findings
can be highlighted form these results. On the one hand,
there is a big proportion of particles under 0.1 μm
(ultrafine), which are typically considered in the PM2.5
group and have been proven to be much more harmful
than their microscopic counterparts. In that sense, this
type of material deserves special attention in particulate
material characterization (Li et al. 2018). On the other
hand, the mean size of the coarse particles was found to
be 4.5 μm. All the studies in the literature and the
monitoring station reports include such particles in the
PM10 group (10 μm) without any further discussion on
particle size or its different effects.
Some aggregates were observed in the images. They
are usually composed of primary particles with a uni-
form diameter (between 4 nm and 55 nm) and are
formed by van der Waals, electrostatic, and surface
adhesive forces (Yang et al. 2016). It has been reported
that such particles are mainly emitted by road transport,

industrial processes, and stationary combustion (Liati
et al. 2016).
In the histogram in Fig. 4, the particle sizes range
between 0.02 and 14 μm. This indicates a higher pres-
ence of ultrafine and fine particles in the collected PM,
which is associated with serious problems for human
health (Bai et al. 2018; Billet et al. 2018; Rajput et al.
2019). As mentioned before, such particles have their
origin in natural sources (volcanic emissions and wild-
fires) as well as anthropogenic ones (traffic, electricity
plants, and agriculture) (Gauterin et al. 2017). In gener-
al, PM whose diameter exceeds 10 μm can be largely
filtered out by the nose and the upper airways. Never-
theless, fine and ultrafine particles can deposit into the
lungs and the respiratory system, and they cannot be
easily eliminated (Xia et al. 2018).
The lungs are the first target of air pollution. PM is
associated with asthma, respiratory infections, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Anderson et al.
2012). In addition, due to their size, ultrafine particles
can move from the lungs into the blood stream and
negatively impact the heart function, brain, and blood
vessels with fatal consequences (Martinelli et al. 2013).
Furthermore, ultrafine PM can directly enter the cells.
Marchini et al. (Marchini et al. 2013) reported an im-
paired mitochondrial function in heart tissue samples
after exposure to airborne PM, which was associated
with reduced cardiac contractility.
Although particle size is a very important parameter
in PM characterization, chemical composition is also
necessary to identify the possible effects and different
sources of PM. The chemical composition of the PM
collected in this study was obtained by Energy Disper-
sive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) through a statistical
analysis of different zones in the samples. Figure 5
shows an EDS spectrum of the PM with the presence

of elements such as carbon (C), silicon (Si), iron (Fe),
calcium (Ca), and lead (Pb).
Figure 6 shows the element distribution map obtain-
ed from the PM sample. Such EDS mapping identified
the same elements found in the EDS spectrum (carbon,
silicon, iron, calcium, titanium, aluminum, and lead).
More specifically, the silicon (Si) is associated with the
quartz microfiber filter used for sampling and detached
during washing; for that reason, it was not analyzed in
this study.
Table 1 shows the weight percentage (wt%) of the
elements found in the sample by EDS analysis. To obtain
these results, at least 20 samples were analyzed and
weighted. Importantly, the high standard deviation they
present is associated with the high heterogeneity of the
samples and the reduced volume of analysis in the EDS.
Carbon, silicon, and lead are the most abundant
elements in the analysis, and all of them have harmful
effects on human health. However, as mentioned before,
the presence of silicon is related to filter residues, which
could not be separated from the PM. Carbon is associ-
ated with vehicular, industrial, and domestic emissions
(Jandacka et al. 2017); in turn, the combustion of fossil
fuels has been established as the main source of lead
(Crilley et al. 2017). Lead is also one of the most widely
investigated metals due to its negative influence on the
environment and human health. According to the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), lead is
one of the most dangerous air pollutants, affecting mul-
tiple human body systems (U.S. EPA. 2013).
Colombian regulations allow the commercialization
of fourth generation engines. Nevertheless, such
technology has been available since 2005, which sug-
gests that the vehicles in this country are considerably
outdated in terms of the technological level of the en-
gines and could explain the high levels of pollutant
emissions (Martinez-Angel 2018). At the local level,
two-stroke motorcycles, trucks, and dump trucks are
the mobile sources that produce most emissions of par-
ticulate matter in Medellín, but fixed sources also make
an important contribution to environmental pollution
there (Área Metropolitana Valle de Aburrá 2018). Ac-
cording to a different study, in 2015, Medellín was
home to 188 companies, which emitted 144.9 tons of
PM10, 30 tons of 2.5 ppm, and 56 kg of lead (Área
Metropolitana Valle de Aburrá 2017). The presence of
Ca, Al, and Ti in this study could be associated with the
operation of a quarry located 145 m form the sampling
point. It is well known that civil construction and

quarries are significant contributors of such elements
(Bluvshtein et al. 2011; Minguillón et al. 2013; Santos
et al. 2017b). Moreover, Medellín has been ranked as
the second city in Colombia with the largest number of
square meters devoted to construction, which suggests
an increase in cement consumption (DANE 2018). The
presence of iron in the PM is caused by companies and
vehicles (Jia et al. 2018). Although several authors have
reported the presence of other heavy metals in PM, such
as Cr, As, Cd, and Hg (Vimercati et al. 2017; Esposito
et al. 2019), they were not found in this study. The
absence of those elements in the atmosphere may be
due to the fact that they come from industrial, agricul-
tural, domestic, and technological sources that change
from place to place.
Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spec-
trometry (ICP-OES) was used in order to confirm the
presence of lead in the sample, which was found at a
concentration of 6940 nM. As mentioned before, lead is
the most important toxic heavy element in the environ-
ment, since it causes serious problems to human health.
Lead is a cumulative toxicant, and the severity of the
symptoms it causes increases with exposure (World
Health Organization 2018). Consequently, it remains a

serious issue in both developed and developing coun-
tries (Tong et al. 2000; Tuakuila et al. 2013; World
Health Organization 2019), where children are more
vulnerable than adults to its effects (González et al.
2018). For those reasons and based on these results,
we analyzed the effect of lead on the cardiac action
potential.
3.2 Effect of Lead on Ventricular Action Potential
The results of the PM characterization showed high
concentrations of C, Si, and Pb. Because carbona-
ceous materials have already been widely studied
and Si is mostly related to the filter’s material, lead
was selected to investigate its effect on ventricular
action potential by means of computer simulations.
Figure 7 shows the effects of different lead concen-
trations on the main ionic currents and the ventricular
action potential. Under control conditions (without
lead), the maximum current peaks of ICaL and the
slowly activating potassium current (IKs) were −
1.74 μA/μF and 0.15 μA/μF, respectively; the rapidly
activating potassium current (IKr) and the inwardly
rectifying potassium current (IK1) had maximum
peaks at 999.229 and 999.277 s, respectively; and
the APD90 reached 266 ms. As the lead concentration
was increased, a downregulation of ICaL and IKs was
observed, and the IKr and IK1 curves shifted to the left,
which caused an APD shortening. When the highest
lead concentration was applied (1000 nM), the ICaL
and IKs peaks showed values of −0.55 μA/μF and
0.07 μA/μF, indicating decreases of 68% and 53%,
respectively; the IKr and IK1 curves shifted to the left
by 46 ms and 48 ms (maximum peaks at 999.183 s
and 999.229 s), respectively; and the APD90 reached
220 ms, which is a 17% decrease.
The results show that lead concentrations above
600 nM produce similar effects on APD shortening:
600, 800, and 1000 nM caused reductions of 15, 16,
and 17% respectively. Therefore, it was not necessary
to study of the value of lead found by ICP. The
calcium channel block by lead has been reported in
other cell types (Atchison 2003; Peng et al. 2002). In
cardiac tissue, the L-type calcium channel block by
lead was experimentally demonstrated by Bernal et al.
(1997), whose study into the ventricular myocytes of
rats showed that lead blocks the ICaL, generating al-
terations in other ionic currents and an APD shorten-
ing. Such alterations can significantly reduce the
theoretical limit of the path length required for the
development or maintenance of reentries, which ini-
tiate and sustain cardiac arrhythmias (Antzelevitch
and Burashnikov 2011). Reduced APD in human
cardiac tissue is the most likely cause of the reentries
underlying ventricular tachycardias (Ten Tusscher
et al. 2009). Ferreira de Mattos et al. (2017) in isolated
cardiomyocytes, tsA 201 cells, and isolated guinea
pig hearts, reported that lead was cardiotoxic and
reduced cardiac contractility, making the heart prone
to arrhythmias. This was attributed, in part, to the
effects of extracellular lead in blocking calcium cur-
rents through Cav1.2 channels.
4 Conclusions
PM10 collected in Medellín, Colombia, was physico-
chemically characterized in this study. Particle sizes
between 0.056 and 4.5 μm were found, which indicates
the presence of the most harmful particles for human
health, according to the WHO, in that city. Nevertheless,
the amount of this kind of PM is typically
underestimated in all the collectors used for PM
detection.
A great concentration of carbonaceous materials,
which are related to the incomplete combustion of fuel
and engine lubricant, was present in the sample. Addi-
tionally, metals such as Ca, Si, Pb, Ca, Fe, Ti, and Al
were found in the PM and quantified; they are associated
with a quarry near the sampling station, the burning of
fossil fuels, and soil particles.
Lead, the most harmful heavy metal for human health
identified in the sample, was further studied, and our
results show it has a pro-arrhythmic effect that is
reflected in a shortening of the APD. Computational
studies may contribute to a better understanding of the
mechanisms by which PM has unhealthy effects on
cardiac tissue, promoting cardiac diseases such as
arrhythmias.

daily ­PM10 and PAHs concentrations in the both sites 
were 133 μg ­m−3 and 23.8 ng ­m−3 in the pre-monsoon 
period and 49.6 μg ­m−3 and 2.30 ng ­m−3 in the mon-
soon period, respectively. The average daily hopane 
concentration during the pre-monsoon period was 
1.40 ng ­m−3 in Tulsipur and 0.70 ng ­m−3 in Charikot. 
The IndP / (IndP + BghiP) ratio was higher than 0.5 
during monsoon period, indicating combustion of 
biomass and charcoal burning. IndP / (IndP + BghiP) 
between 0.2 and 0.5 during pre-monsoon season indi-
cates petroleum combustion. Fla / (Fla + Pyr) ratio 
between 0.3 and 0.5 during pre-monsoon and mon-
soon periods indicates high proportion of petroleum 
product combustion. The biomass burning associated 
with dense traffic in the center of the two cities was 
the main source of PAHs. The average daily element 
concentration was 6.80 ng ­m−3 in both locations dur-
ing the monsoon period.

Abstract  Concentration of PAHs, hopanes, and 
elements in ­PM10 aerosol samples was measured 
in two Nepalese urban centers, Tulsipur (725  m 
above sea level; 150,000 inhabitants) and Charikot 
(1,550 m above sea level; 23,000 inhabitants) in the 
monsoon period (August 2018) and pre-monsoon 
period (April–May 2019). The 24-h ­PM10 limit value 
of 50  µg  ­m−3 for human health was significantly 
exceeded at all locations, and the Nepal concentra-
tion limit of 150 µg ­m−3 was exceeded at Tulsipur-
bus station, Tulsipur-village, and Charikot-hospital 
in the pre-monsoon season. The average daily ­PM10 
and PAHs concentrations showed seasonal variations, 
with lower concentrations in the monsoon season and 
the higher values in pre-monsoon season. The average

environmental impacts such as deterioration of air 
quality, global climate change, visibility reduction, 
and smog production (Mikuška et al., 2020; Seinfeld 
& Pandis, 1998). Various studies have shown a link 
between increased PM concentration and adverse 
health effects including allergy, asthma, cardiovas-
cular and respiratory diseases, cancer, and increased 
mortality (Brunekreef & Holgate, 2002; Kim et  al., 
2015). The health effects of atmospheric aerosols 
depend mainly on the particle size, the chemical com-
position of particles, and solubility of PM compo-
nents in lung fluid. The size of the particle determines 
how long the particle remains in the atmosphere and 
where it subsequently settles in the human airways. 
­PM10 particles (i.e., particles with aerodynamic 
diameter of 10 µm or less) deposit in upper part of 
respiratory tract while smaller particles such as ­PM2.5 
and ­PM1 particles, due to their small sizes, are able 
to penetrate deep into the lungs (Biswas et al., 2020; 
International Commission on Radiological Protec-
tion, 1994).
PM10 aerosol originates from different emission 
sources such as combustion of coal, biomass, gaso-
line, oil, or diesel fuel. ­PM10 also includes dust from 
agriculture, wildfires, industrial sources, construction 
sites, resuspended dust from road and soil, and pollen.
The chemical composition of ­PM10 is very com-
plex consisting, in general, from carbonaceous spe-
cies, soot, inorganic ions, and elements in variable 
amounts, depending on their location and emission 
sources (Seinfeld & Pandis, 1998). Despite the huge 
number of chemical compounds contained in PM, 
only a limited number of them is considered hazard-
ous to human health. These potentially harmfull com-
pounds include mostly polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs) and some elements (Cd, Pb, Ni, As, Tl, 
Hg, etc.) because of their carcinogenic and mutagenic 
properties (Schroeder et al., 1984; Masiol et al., 2012; 
Křůmal & Mikuška, 2020; Cigánková et al., 2021a). 
PAHs are formed largely during the incomplete com-
bustion of organic material at high temperatures 
(Křůmal et  al., 2013), while elements are emitted 
from variety of emission sources including mainly 
coal and biomass combustion, traffic, and industry 
(Mikuška et al., 2020).
PAHs and elements bound to PM may exert an 
adverse toxic effect only after particle deposition on 
the lung surface, when the soluble particulate compo-
nents may be dissolved into the pulmonary surfactant. 
It is assumed that the soluble fraction of PM compo-
nents is more relevant to the assessment of human 
health risks than their total concentration (Cigánková 
et al., 2021b).
Nepal is one of the fastest growing countries in 
South Asia (Waldorf, 2018). In the State of Global 
Air Report 2020, Nepal is listed among the top 10 
countries with the highest outdoor ­PM2.5 levels in 
2019 (Global Air, 2020). Therefore, air pollution is 
currently one of Nepal’s biggest problems. This is 
due to the rapid deterioration of the urban environ-
ment, which is mainly due to unplanned urbaniza-
tion, transport development (Majumder et al., 2012), 
and industrialization. Concentrations of aerosol par-
ticles regularly reach levels that have been shown to 
be hazardous to human health (Gurung et al., 2013). 
For example, Kathmandu is one of the most polluted 
cities in Asia due to high concentrations of ­PM2.5 and 
­PM10 (Majumder et al., 2012), which regularly exceed 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-
EPA) (Giri et al., 2008) and World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) (CAI-Asia, 2006; World Health Organi-
zation, 2014) limits. Growing population, increasing 
industry and automobile traffic, heavy deforestation, 
and forest fires accelerate the deterioration of air 
quality.
Air pollution by aerosols, ­NO2, ­O3, etc. can be 
studied using satellite data produced by the spectrom-
eters MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec-
troradiometer), TROPOMI (Filonchyk & Yan, 2018), 
etc. (Filonchyk et al., 2018; Biswas et al., 2020; Tor-
res et  al., 2020). The satellite instruments provide 
information about long-term trends of the evaluation 
and variability of spatial distributions of the total con-
centrations of aerosols and other pollutants on local 
or global scales. Alternatively, the aerosols are moni-
tored using ground based instruments that allow the 
measurement of aerosol concentrations over shorter 
time intervals and, moreover, the measurement of aer-
osols in selected size intervals such as size fractions 
­PM1, ­PM2.5, or ­PM10.
The research on air pollution from ­PM10 (Giri 
et  al., 2008) and PAH (Chen et  al., 2015, 2017) in 
Nepal is focused mainly on the capital Kathmandu, 
including the Kathmandu Valley and the area of 
Himalayan Mountains regions. Emissions and pol-
lutant concentrations (including PM) in Kathmandu 
area were estimated by atmospheric transport, depo-
sition, and chemistry models (Adhikary et al., 2007).

Another measurement study examined PAH concen-
trations in ­PM10 in an urban area in the Kathmandu 
Valley (Kishida et al., 2009). Biomass and fossil fuel 
combustion especially by vehicles were identified as 
the main source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Yu et al., 2008). Other study showed higher PM con-
centrations and lead levels in PM samples near roads 
(Aryal et  al., 2008). The highest ­PM10 concentra-
tions were found near industrial centers (Aryal et al., 
2008). Concentrations of ­PM10 were typically higher 
in pre-monsoon (Aryal et al., 2008; Giri et al., 2008).
However, basic available information on atmos-
pheric ­PM10 and its components such as PAHs and 
elements in the Himalayan Mountains (sources, 
types, emissions, concentrations, and fate) is still 
limited (Chen et al., 2015). Several studies described 
ambient measurements of ­PM10, or air quality model 
results for high-altitude areas (e.g. Nepal Climate 
Observatory Pyramid in the Khumbu Valley (5,079 m 
a.s.l.)) (Decesari et al., 2010; Giri et al., 2004, 2008; 
Majumder et al., 2012). The major ­PM10 components 
have been identified as organics and mineral dust, 
with combustion being an important source (Decesari 
et al., 2010). The measurements show temporal pat-
terns. Most pollutants (e.g., ­PM2.5, ­NO2) were higher 
during the pre-monsoon than during the monsoon 
(Sellegri et  al., 2010). Studies showed a regional 
influence on air quality at high elevations (Bonasoni 
et al., 2010).
A major limitation in research on the effect of par-
ticular matter (PM), PAHs, and elements on human 
health in Nepal is the lack of exposure data (Gurung 
et  al., 2013). PAHs are hazardous to humans when 
inhaled (Gong et  al., 2011). Therefore, PAHs have 
received considerable attention owing to their per-
sistence and toxicity, particularly their carcinogenic 
and/or mutagenic properties (Bhargava et  al., 2004; 
Křůmal & Mikuška, 2020). Ambient monitoring net-
works maintained by government organizations are 
required for these purposes. Such data are still not 
available for the whole of Nepal. Only for PM in the 
Kathmandu Valley did the Nepalese government rou-
tinely measure ­PM10 until 2007 (Gurung et al., 2013). 
However, information on current levels of particulate 
matter, including various size fractions, and other pol-
lutants for all Nepal is needed (Gurung et al., 2013) 
to assess health risks. Such work could include ambi-
ent monitoring of PM concentration with alternative, 
low-cost measurement methods using optical sensors 
(Kumar et al., 2015; McKercher et al., 2017).
Information on air pollution focusing on particu-
late PAHs and heavy elements in Nepal is still lim-
ited. To extend the knowledge, this study shows the 
results of monitoring particulate matter ­(PM10) and 
bound PAHs, hopanes, and elements in two differ-
ent Nepalese Urban centers, Tulsipur in the southern 
part of Nepal in the Teraj area and Charikot in the 
northern Himalayas, which are highly affected by 
air pollution. Simultaneously with the measurement 
of dust particles, continuous data on temperature, 
relative humidity, global radiation, wind speed, and 
wind direction were collected directly at the measure-
ment site. Based on these measurements, an overall 
data analysis was conducted in these areas during the 
monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons. In addition, we 
compared ­PM10 concentration measured in parallel 
by the real-time particle monitor Has-Dust Electronic 
Pilot Activity and Alertness Monitor (EPAM) 5000 
and low-cost sensors in the pre-monsoon season for 
the possible future use of the sensors in Nepal.
2  Materials and Methods
2.1  Site Description
Tulsipur is the second most populous city in the Nep-
alese district of Dang with more than 150,000 inhab-
itants and occupies a municipal area of 385 ­km2. The 
area of Tulsipur is located at an average altitude of 
725 m above sea level. Charikot (officially Bhimesh-
war) is a smaller town of less than 23,000 inhabitants 
located in the northeastern part of Nepal’s Dolakha 
district. The town is composed of several neighboring 
villages and occupies a total area of 70 ­km2 at an alti-
tude of about 1,550 m above sea level (Fig. 1).
Nepal is characterized by a subtropical climate 
with extensive summer monsoon rains between June 
and early September. The average temperature var-
ies between 12 and 14 °C, with a minimum of about 
0 °C during the pre-season and a maximum of about 
35 °C during the summer season and varies consid-
erably depending on the altitude. Wind speed aver-
ages between 0.4 and 7.5 m ­s−1 and average humidity 
ranges between 50 and 80% depending on the season 
(Sill & Kirkby, 2013).

The monitoring was conducted in two periods. 
The first took place in the late August 2018 dur-
ing the monsoon period finishing and the second in 
April–May 2019 during the pre-monsoon period. 
Measurements were conducted at 5 sites, two of 
which were located in the center of Tulsipur (Tulsipur 
– Bank 28.133° N, 82.298° E, Tulsipur – Bus Station 
28.132°N, 82.292°E), one of which was located in 
Tulsipur–Village (28.084°N, 82.376°E) (Fig.  1) and 
two in the center of Charikot, (Charikot – Hospital 
27.666°N, 86.046°E Charikot – Crossroad 27.663°N, 
86.048°E) (Fig.  1). Tulsipur has increased urbani-
zation and increased numbers of vehicles in recent 
decades due to increases in the numbers of local resi-
dents. It is also a region with significant rural biomass 
burning. Charikot is located in rural areas of the cen-
tral Himalayas and is characterized by intense local 
anthropogenic activities due to increases in the num-
bers of tourists. In Tulsipur, two polluted locations, 
near the central bus station and central junction, and 
one location on the margin of Tulsipur, near cement 
factory, were selected. In Charikot, two very polluted 
locations in the city center, a central junction and a 
hospital, were used. Monitoring took place from 19 
to 21 August 2018 (monsoon) and from 30 to 4 May 
2019 (pre-monsoon) in Tulsipur and from 26 to 28 
August 2018 (monsoon) and from 10 to 13 May 2019 
(pre-monsoon) in Charikot. The measurements were 
performed for 24  h at each location (Central Euro-
pean Summer Time).

2.2  PM10 Concentration and Meteorological 
Parameter Measurement
Aerosol in the ­PM10 size fraction was measured using 
two Haz-Dust EPAM-5000 monitors (Environmental 
Devices Corporation, USA) equipped with ­PM10 par-
ticle size inlets, and during the pre-monsoon period 
also in parallel with a Cairsens micro-sensor (Envea, 
France) for particulate matters (PM). The monitor 
Haz-Dust EPAM-5000 and the Cairsens sensor were 
placed side by side at a distance of 50 cm. The Haz-
Dust EPAM 5000 is a high-sensitivity, real-time mon-
itoring device for particulate matter and is primarily 
intended for outdoor air quality measurement. This 
device combines traditional aerosol particle trapping 
on filters with real-time tracking methods. Haz-Dust 
EPAM-5000 measures the mass concentration of 
­PM10 aerosol particles in the air with a real-time reso-
lution of 1 min based on light scattering from the par-
ticles. The data is stored in the device’s internal mem-
ory and displayed in real time on the device display. 
The measurement methodology is based on the Euro-
pean Standard for Particulate Measurement in Air 
(Brunekreef & Maynard, 2008). Particles collected 
by the Cairsens microsensor pass through a continu-
ous laser beam in the measuring chamber and scat-
ter light in all directions according to the principle of 
light scattering. This scattered light is analyzed to cal-
culate a mass concentration for the size fraction ­PM10 
(Cairsens, 2020). Uncertainty of Haz-Dust EPAM-
500 monitor is smaller than 3 μg ­m−3. Uncertainty of 
Cairsens micro-sensors is smaller than 5 μg ­m−3.
Temperature and relative humidity of air were 
measured with a Young 4137LC/LF sensor (Young 
Company, Traverse City, Michigan, USA). Wind 
speed and wind direction were measured with a Gill 
2D ultrasonic anemometer (Hampshire, UK), and 
solar radiation intensity was measured with a RS 
81 pyranometer (Envitech Bohemia, Prague, Czech 
Republic).
2.3  Sampling of Aerosols
Atmospheric aerosols in the size fraction ­PM10 
were sampled on quartz fiber (47 mm, QMA, What-
man) and nitrocellulose membrane (47 mm, 1.2 µm 
porosity, Millipore) filters in parallel at a flow rate 
of approximately 4  l/min using two aerosol sam-
plers (Haz-Dust EPAM-5000) for 24  h in August 
2018 (monsoon period) and May 2019 (pre-monsoon 
period). The quartz filters were pre-baked at 500 °C 
for 24 h to remove organic contaminants. Mass con-
centrations of ­PM10 aerosols were determined gravi-
metrically from the difference in filter weights before 
and after sampling using a microbalance (± 1  µg, 
M5P, Sartorius) in a dedicated climate controlled 
weighing room (48 h, air temperature 20 ± 0.1 °C, rel-
ative humidity 50 ± 2%). After weighing, the exposed 
filters were used for chemical analyzes. A total num-
ber of 5 quartz filters in pre-monsoon period (3 in 
Tulsipur, 2 in Charikot), 5 quartz filters in monsoon 
period (3 in Tulsipur, 2 in Charikot), and 5 nitrocel-
lulose filters in monsoon period (3 in Tulsipur, 2 in 
Charikot) were collected.
2.4  Chemical Analysis of Aerosols
2.4.1  Elements
Aerosols collected on nitrocellulose membrane filters 
were analyzed for elemental content. Each filter was 
decomposed in 3 mL of concentrated, sub-boil grade 
nitric acid using a microwave-assisted digestion sys-
tem (UltraWAVE, Milestone). The decomposed fil-
ters were transferred quantitatively along with 7 mL 
of deionized water into polyethylene scintillation 
vials (Kartel, Italy). The content of 25 elements (Na, 
Mg, Al, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Ti, Cu, Zn, Fe, 
As, Se, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba, Tl, Pb, Rh, Pd, and Pt) in the 
digestions was determined using a triple quadrupole 
ICP-MS (ICP-MS/MS 8800, Agilent) with two quad-
rupoles (Q1 and Q2) and an octupole reaction cell in 
different tune modes (collision/reaction, He, ­O2, and 
­NH3), working in the on mass mode and mass shift 
mode used to determine selected elements. Cd was 
analyzed in ­NH3 MS/MS mode As, and Se and Fe 
were analyzed in ­O2 MS/MS mode. The forwarded RF 
power was 1550 W, carrier gas (Ar) flow rate 1.07 L 
­min−1, and integration time per isotope was 0.3 s in 
all used modes and cell gas flow rates: helium in col-
lision single quadrupole mode: 4 mL ­min−1, ­4th cell 
gas ­(O2 in reaction MS/MS mode): 0.29 mL ­min−1, 
­3rd cell gas ­(NH3 in reaction MS/MS mode) + helium: 
4 mL ­min−1 ­NH3 + 1 mL ­min−1 He (Cigánková et al.,

European Commission, Belgium) were digested and 
analyzed at the same conditions as samples for the 
control of the whole determination process from 
preparation to determination.
Calibration standards were prepared in a matrix 
of 2% ­HNO3 from a 1.0000 g ­L−1 stock solution of 
a single element (Analytika Prague, Czech Republic) 
mixing into one solution in the concentration range of 
0–10 mg ­L−1 for Na, Mg, Ca, K, Mn, Al, and Fe and 
0 – 100 µg ­L−1 for the rest of elements. Calibration 
curves of all elements were linear in the whole range 
(R2 = 0.9994–1.0000). Internal standard for elements 
determination were prepared from commercial 10 mg 
­L−1 mixture of Bi, Ge, In, Li, Sc, Tb, and Y (Agilent 
technologies, USA) by dilution in 2% ­HNO3 to final 
concentration 100  µg ­L−1. The tuning solution was 
prepared from commercial 10 mg.l−1 mixture of Li, 
Co, Y, Ce, Mg, and Tl (Agilent technologies, USA) to 
final concentration 1 μg ­L−1 each element in a matrix 
of 2% ­HNO3.
The accuracy of the method was periodically 
evaluated by use of two standard reference materi-
als: SRM 1640a Trace Elements in Natural Water 
(National Institute of Standards & Technology, Gaith-
ersburg, USA) and SLRS-5 River water reference 
material for trace elements (National Research Coun-
cil, Canada). In addition, a control standard (10 μg 
­L−1 calibration standard) was measured periodically 
for instrument stability control. Instrument stability 
control was online monitored using internal standard 
solution (Cigánková et al., 2021a).
2.4.2  Organic Compounds
Aerosols sampled on quartz fiber filters were ana-
lyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
and hopanes content. Recovery standards (phen-
anthrene-D10, chrysene-D12, perylene-D12, and 
ααα(20R)-cholestane-D2) were added to the filters 
prior to organic compounds extraction to compen-
sate for losses during sample preparation. The filters 
were extracted three times with 15 mL of mixture of 
a dichloromethane and hexane (v/v 1:1) for 30  min 
under ultrasonic agitation. The extracts (total 45 mL) 
were dried to 0.5 mL under a stream of nitrogen and 
fractionated by column chromatography (Křůmal 
et al., 2013). Two fractions were taken after eluting 
the prepared column with different solvents. The first 
hexane fraction (30 mL) contained hopanes and the 
second dichloromethane/hexane fraction (1:1, v/v, 
30  mL) contained PAHs. Both fractions were again 
dried to 1 mL under a gentle stream of nitrogen and 
analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass 
spectrometry (GC–MS). The GC–MS (Agilent, 
7890A, 5975C) was equipped with a capillary column 
HP5-MS (30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d., and 0.25 µm film 
thickness). A sample (1 µL) was injected. The carrier 
gas was helium (5.5) with a flow rate of 1 ml ­min−1. 
The MS was operated in electron ionization mode 
(70  eV) and in single-ion monitoring (SIM) mode 
with m/z characteristic of PAHs, hopanes, and recov-
ery standards (Křůmal et al., 2013).
Analyzed organic compounds included 20 polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., fluorene, phenanthrene, 
anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene, retene, benz[a]
anthracene, chrysene, triphenylene, benzo[b]fluoran-
thene, 
benzo[j]fluoranthene,

(i.e., 17α,21β-norhopane, 17β,21α-norhopane, 17α,21β-
hopane, 17β,21α-hopane, 22S-17α,21β-homohopane,

3  Results and Discussion
3.1  PM10 Concentration and Meteorological 
Conditions
Table  1 shows the average temperature and relative 
humidity of air, global radiation, wind speed, and 
direction at the measured locations in Tulsipur and 
Charikot. Daily clocks with zero values were counted 
when calculating daily average of global radia-
tion. Measurements took place at the studied loca-
tions during the pre-monsoon (May) and monsoon 
(August) seasons, which represent two different types 
of weather conditions. The monsoon period is mostly 
accompanied by a higher temperature and higher rela-
tive humidity in the studied localities.
The concentrations of ­PM10 aerosol (µg ­m−3) 
during the monsoon and pre-monsoon period, meas-
ured with a temporal resolution of 30 min using the 
Haz-Dust monitors at selected locations in Tulsipur 
and Charikot, are shown in Fig. 2. The concentra-
tion of ­PM10 aerosols showed a seasonal trend: in 
the monsoon season, the daily ­PM10 concentra-
tions were lower than in the pre-monsoon period 
(Table  2). The lower concentration observed dur-
ing monsoon season can be attributed to washout by 
rainfall and higher relative humidity of air leading 
to reduced resuspension of street dust. In the mon-
soon period, the 24-h limit value of 50 µg.m−3 for 
human health (World Health Organization, 2006) 
for ­PM10 was significantly exceeded at the Tul-
sipur-bus station and Charikor-crossroad (Table 2). 
On the other hand, during pre-monsoon periods, 
the WHO limit value for ­PM10 was significantly 
exceeded at all locations, and the Nepal concentra-
tion limit of 150 µg.m−3 was exceeded at Tulsipur 
bus station, Tulsipur village, and Charikot hospi-
tal (Table 2). These results are consistent with the 
minimum ­PM10 level during monsoon period and 
maximum ­PM10 levels during pre-monsoon periods 
in Kathmandu Valley in the year 2005 presented by 
Giri et al., (2004, 2008) who reported the influence 
of meteorological conditions on ­PM10 concentra-
tions at different locations in the Kathmandu Val-
ley with ­PM10 levels ranging from 7 μg ­m−3 (Mat-
syagaon) to 633 μg ­m−3 (Putalisadak). Our highest 
measured 24  h concentration (182.07  μg  ­m−3) at 
Tulsipur bus station in the pre-monsoon period is 
about three times lower than the highest daily ­PM10 
average of 633  μg  ­m−3 in the Kathmandu Valley 
(Giri et al., 2008).
The ­PM10 concentrations measured in high traf-
fic areas during the present study were mostly much 
lower values than those reported by Majumder et al. 
(2012) at a network of ten high-traffic road intersec-
tions in the Kathmandu Valley, but similar or lower 
than those reported in other studies conducted in 
Nepal (Aryal et al., 2008; Giri et al., 2007, 2008).
PM10 concentrations were dynamic during the 
day, with the minimum at night and the maximum

in the morning and late afternoon at all Tulsipur 
sites in the pre-monsoon period, as traffic and 
movement on roads increased at this time (Fig. 2a, 
b, c). A similar trend was observed in the monsoon 
period (peak values in the morning and afternoon), 
but with lower maximum values (Fig. 2a, b, c). The 
highest ­PM10 concentrations were measured at traf-
fic site at both Tulsipur and Charikot. A very high 
value (668.34  μg  ­m−3) was measured in the late 
afternoon at the bus station in Tulsipur (Fig.  2a) 
in the pre-monsoon season and a concentration of 
743.22 μg ­m−3 was measured at a busy crossroad in 
Charikot (Fig.  2d) at night in the monsoon period 
and a concentration of 675.43  μg  ­m−3 in the late 
afternoon in Charikot Hospital in the monsoon 
period (Fig. 2e).
In the monsoon season, the easterly wind direction 
prevailed in Tulsipur-bus station (Fig. 3a), westerly in

Tulsipur-bank (Fig. 3c), northerly in Tulsipur-village 
(Fig.  3e), and the southerly in Charikot-crossroad 
(Fig. 3g). Throughout the measurement, the average 
wind speed in all locations was about 0.6 m ­s−1, with 
maximum values up to 0.8 m ­s−1. In the pre-monsoon 
period, the variable southwesterly wind direction pre-
vailed in Tulsipur-bus station (Fig. 3b), variable east-
erly in Tulsipur-bank (Fig.  3d) and Tulsipur-village 
(Fig.  3f). The variable southeasterly wind direction 
prevailed in Charikot-crossroad (Fig. 3h) in the pre-
monsoon period. The average wind speed was about 
4.9  m  ­s−1 throughout the measurement at all loca-
tions, with peak values up to 9.4 m ­s−1, which is com-
mon for the area during this period (www.​meteo​blue.​
com). ­PM10 concentrations correlate with wind direc-
tion at each site (Fig. 3).
3.2  Comparison PM10 Results of HAZ‑DUST 
EPAM‑5000 Analyzer and Sensor ENVEA PM 
Cairsens
The low-cost devices seem to be promising tool for 
establishing an air quality monitoring network in 
Nepal, where it is difficult to set up stationary moni-
toring stations for economic and technical reasons. 
Due to their small size and low weight, these sensors 
can also be used for mobile measurements and on 
unmanned aerial vehicles (drones).
In addition, it is necessary to focus on appropri-
ate methods of data processing (especially their vali-
dation) and subsequent interpretation of the results, 
since the measurement itself can be severely affected 
not only by the recognized lower accuracy of sen-
sor measurements (Castell et  al., 2017) but also by 
current meteorological conditions (temperature and 
humidity) or interference from various pollutants 
(especially observed especially in gaseous sensors) 
(Lewis et al., 2018).
Figure  4 shows a comparison of measured data 
from HAZ-DUST EPAM-5000 optical analyzer at a 
sampling rate of 1 per minute and ENVEA PM Cairs-
ens optical sensor at a sampling rate of 1 per minute 
at the monitored sites in Tulsipur and Charikot in the 
pre-monsoon period. The correlation coefficient (R2) 
between the raw ­PM10 sensor data and ­PM10 analyzer 
is 0.96 (RMSE is 63.4 μg ­m−3) for Tulsipur – bus sta-
tion (Fig. 4a), 0.94 (RMSE is 42.8 μg ­m−3) for Tul-
sipur – bank (Fig. 4b), 0.93 (RMSE is 76.9 μg ­m−3) 
for Tulsipur – village (Fig.  4c), 0.84 (RMSE is 
51.7 μg ­m−3) for Charikot – crossroad (Fig. 4d), and 
0.85 (RMSE is 54.6 μg ­m−3) for Charikot – hospital 
(Fig.  4e). These results indicate a good correlation 
between the low-cost sensor and the reference ana-
lyzer (i.e., Haz-Dust). The accuracy of the optical 
particle sensor was calculated as the mean error and 
maximum error compared to the ­PM10 analyzer.
It is evident that the data from both instruments 
show a similar trend, but they show differences in 
the particle concentrations measured. This is mainly 
due to the difference in measurement configuration. 
­PM10 concentrations found by Cairsens sensors 
are in average by 13.2% lower than those found by 
EPAM analyzer. Sahu et al. (2020) validated Plan-
tower PM sensor measuring ambient ­PM10 concen-
trations with that measured with optical particle 
sizers (OPS) and aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) 
at two sites in the Delhi (India) with Spearman’s 
rank-order correlations (rs = 0.64–0.83) between

­PM10 RMSE of 6.1 μg ­m−3, R2 0.96 was achieved. 
However, the low–cost sensor needs to be in detail

3.3  PAHs and Hopanes
All ­PM10 samples were analyzed for PAHs and hopanes. 
PAHs are generally derived from imperfect combustion of 
organic matter. Some PAHs serve as a specific molecular 
markers for the combustion of plastics (1,3,5-triphenylb-
enzene), softwood (retene), or coal (picene). Gasoline 
vehicles emit higher concentrations of indeno[1,2,3-c,d]
pyrene, 
dibenz[a,h]anthracene 
and 
benzo[g,h,i]per-
ylene, while diesel vehicles emit higher concentrations of 
phenanthrene and pyrene (Mikuška et al., 2015; Ravindra 
et al., 2008; Simoneit et al., 2005). PAHs were present in 
low concentrations in all ­PM10 samples (Table 3). Low-
molecular weight PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthylene, 
and acenaphthene) resulted in high losses during sample 
preparation; therefore, these PAHs were not quantified. 
Phenanthrene/anthracene, 
benz[a]anthracene/chrysene/
triphenylene, and benzo[b + j + k]fluoranthene are listed 
in the table as sum values because these compounds were 
not sufficiently separated in the GC column.

Indeno[1,2,3-c,d]pyrene, 
dibenz[a,h]anthracene, 
and benzo[g,h,i]perylene were the most abundant 
PAHs both at Tulsipur and Charikot, while lighter 
PAHs such as phenanthrene, fluoranthene, or pyrene 
were present at lower concentrations.
The measured PAH concentrations were different 
at the five sampling sites in both the monsoon and 
pre-monsoon period. In addition, the concentration of 
PAHs showed seasonal variation with concentrations 
higher in the pre-monsoon period than in the mon-
soon period at all sites (except the Tulsipur bank at a 
busy traffic junction). The mean total PAH concentra-
tions during the monsoon period were 2.4 ng ­m−3 in 
Tulsipur and 2.0 ng ­m−3 in Charikot in the monsoon 
period and 31.6 ng ­m−3 in Tulsipur and 12.2 ng ­m−3 
in Charikot in pre-monsoon period, respectively. Con-
centrations during the monsoon period were similar 
at both locations, but during pre-monsoon period, 
PAH concentrations were higher in Tulsipur than 
Charikot. A similar difference between the southern 
rural area of Nepal (Tulsipur) and the Northern Him-
alayan region of Nepal (Charikot) was recently found 
in another study (Chen et al., 2017).
Table 4 compares our results for PAHs with other 
Nepalese and foreign cities in Asia. The average val-
ues of PAHs for each location listed in the table did 
not differ between monsoon and pre-monsoon peri-
ods, except for Nanjing (urban district) in China and 
Barapani (foothills of Himalayas) in the Nepal in 
pre-monsoon season. The values at Tulsipur Bank 
(2.7 ng ­m−3), Charikot crossroad (16.2 ng ­m−3), and 
Charikot Hospital (8.2  ng  ­m−3) in the pre-monsoon 
season are lower to those reported (Wang et al., 2017) 
in Nanjing (18.1 ng ­m−3) in China and higher (except 
Charikot junction) than the value reported (Rajput 
et al., 2013) in Barapani (14.1 ng ­m−3) in Nepal in the 
pre-monsoon season.
Hopanes, which serve as coal combustion and traf-
fic markers, were found in ­PM10 samples only in the 
pre-monsoon period (Table  5). The concentrations

of some hopanes in the samples were slightly above 
the limit of detection (LOD) and were affected by 
the higher uncertainty of analytical determination, 
while the concentrations of hopanes in all monsoon 
samples were below LOD (0.080—0.302  ng/m3). 
The mean total concentration of hopanes during the 
pre-monsoon period was 1.39  ng  ­m−3 in Tulsipur 
and 0.69 ng ­m−3 in Charikot. At both sites, the high-
est concentrations were found for 17α(H),21β(H)-
norhopane that serves as a tracer for motor vehicle 
exhaust (Mikuška et al., 2015). The high concentra-
tions were found also for 17α(H),21β(H)-hopane, 
another marker of traffic.
Since the concentrations of hopanes in the air 
have not yet been measured in Nepal, we compared 
our results with urban and mountain measurements 
in China (Table  6). The concentrations of selected 
hopanes in Tulsipur and Charikot were several times 
lower than those in Baoji (urban). On the other hand, 
the concentration of 17α,21β-hopane in Tulsipur 
and Charikot was 2–5 times higher than that in Mt. 
Tai (mountain) and the concentration of 17α,21β-
norhopane was 5–14 times higher than that in Mt. Tai 
(mountain).
3.4  Elements
25 elements were analyzed in ­PM10 samples col-
lected only during monsoon period due to a failure 
of one sampler during the 1st day of sampling in the 
pre-monsoon period. The concentration of platinum 
elements (Rh, Pd, and Pt) in all samples was below 
the value of LOD. The concentrations of the other 
analyzed elements in ­PM10 are shown in Table 7 and 
Fig. 5. Al was dominant element followed by Ca, Fe, 
K, Mg, Na, and Ti in all locations except Tulsipur 
– village. High concentrations of these elements (Fe, 
Ca, Al, Mg, Na, K, and Ti) were mainly due to street 
dust resuspension of Earth crust material by wind or 
vehicle operation. Other elements were present in 
­PM10 aerosol samples at lower concentrations. The 
sum of elements in localities in Tulsipur town (15.1,

6.36 and 3.60  ng  ­m−3) is mostly higher than those 
in localities in Charikot (3.28 ng ­m−3, 5.52 ng ­m−3). 
The sum of elements in localities in Tulsipur vil-
lage (3.60  ng  ­m−3) is similar to Charikot crossroad 
(3.28 ng ­m−3).
Table 8 compares our results with selected foreign 
localities. The concentrations of elements in Tul-
sipur and Charikot were higher than those reported 
by Tyagi et al. (2012) for rural and industrial sites in 
India except Cr at Tulsipur – bank. On the contrary, 
the concentrations of elements in localities in India 
are lower compared to Tulsipur and Charikot.
3.5  Source Identification
Identification of emission sources of analyzed aero-
sols and their components is currently mostly per-
formed by using various multivariate receptor models 
(Cigánková et al., 2021a; Mikuška et al., 2020; Viana 
et al., 2008). However, the use of receptor models is 
not possible in this study due to the small number of 
­PM10 samples. Therefore, the emission sources of 
the analyzed ­PM10 aerosols were identified using the 
diagnostic ratios and the content of selected organic 
markers and elements in the analyzed samples 
(Cigánková et al., 2021a; Křůmal et al., 2013, 2017; 
Mikuška et al., 2015, 2020).
The presence of retene and picene in ­PM10 samples 
proves the combustion of biomass and coal (Křůmal 
et al., 2017; Mikuška et al., 2015) as the sources of 
PAHs in analyzed ­PM10 samples, while the presence 
of 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene suggests the combustions 
of plastics and waste (Simoneit et al., 2005). The high 
concentration of indeno[123-cd] pyrene, dibenz[a,h]
anthracene, and benzo[g,h,i]perylene in the ­PM10 
samples indicates vehicular emissions (particularly 
emissions from gasoline vehicles) as another emission 
source of the ­PM10 aerosols in Tulsipur and Charikot 
(Mikuška et al., 2015; Ravindra et al., 2008).
Presence of hopanes in ­PM10 aerosol samples 
indicates both traffic and coal combustion as emis-
sion source of hopanes in both Tulsipur and Charikot. 
17α(H),21β(H)-norhopane was the most abundant 
hopane, which together with high concentration of 
17α(H),21β(H)-hopane and similar concentrations 
of R and S isomer of 17α(H),21β(H)-homohopane 
proves that hopanes in Tulsipur and Charikot origi-
nated predominantly from traffic emissions.

The parental PAH ratios are calculated to identify 
the origin of PAHs (Rajput et al., 2014). Table 9 lists 
most commonly used parental PAH ratios (Rajput 
et al., 2014) calculated for aerosols collected during 
the monsoon and pre-monsoon period at selected 
sites in Tulsipur and Charikot and their comparison 
with other sites in Nepal and China. In this case, 
they are indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, benzo[g,h,i]per-
ylene, fluoranthene, and pyrene. If the ratio IndP 
/ (IndP + BghiP) is less than 0.2, it is unprocessed 
oil, if it is between 0.2 and 0.5, it is petroleum prod-
ucts combustion and the value more than 0.5 shows 
biomass and coal combustion. For the ration Fla / 
(Fla + Pyr), it is less than 0.4, it is clear that it is crude 
oil, if it is between 0.4 and 0.5, it is the combustion 
of petroleum products and the combustion of biomass 
and coal shows values more than 0.5 (Chen et  al., 
2017; Yunker et al., 2002).
Table 9 shows the diagnostic ratios of PAHs in aer-
osols during the monsoon and pre-monsoon period at 
selected sites in Tulsipur and Charikot and their com-
parison with other sites in Nepal and China. From 
the measurements, it is clear that the average IndP / 
(IndP + BghiP) ratio was higher than 0.5 during the 
measurements in the monsoon period at individual 
locations in Tulsipur and Charikot, which clearly 
indicates high pollution from biomass and coal burn-
ing. In pre-monsoon period, the ratio was less than 
0.5, suggesting combustion of petroleum products 
probably within vehicle traffic or household activities 
as a source of PAHs. For the Fla / (Fla + Pyr) ratio, 
values between 0.3 and 0.5 prevailed, indicating a 
high proportion of combustion of petroleum products.
A ratio of BeP/(BeP + BaP) due to different atmos-
pheric stability of both species is frequently used to 
distinguish local/regional sources from long range 
transport of pollutants (Mikuška 2015). In pre-mon-
soon period, the values of the ratio for both studied 
localities were smaller than 0.5 (mean value of 0.41), 
which indicates sampling of ­PM10 aerosols freshly 
emitted from the local or nearby regional emission 
sources. During monsoon period, the values of the 
ratio for both studied localities were higher than 0.5 
(mean value of 0.64), suggesting transport of sampled 
­PM10 aerosols from larger distances.
The elements analyzed in collected ­PM10 aerosols 
largely originate from various emission sources such 
as resuspension of Earth crust material (Al, Ca, Mg, 
Fe, Ti, K, etc.), industrial activity (Fe, Co, Cd, Cu, 
Cr, V, Ni, As, Ca, Mn, Sn, Zn, etc.), biomass (wood) 
burning (K, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Na, etc.), coal combus-
tion (Se, As, Cd, K, Mn, Zn, Pb, Na, Cu, Ca, Tl, Cr, 
etc.), emissions from automobile transport (Sb, Mn, 
Ba, Zn, Cu, Fe, V, Ca, Tl, Sn, Cd, Cr, Mg, Ni, and 
Pb), oil combustion (V and Ni), cement plant (Ca, Zn, 
Fe, Mn, Sb, Pb, Cd, Tl, As, Cu, Ni, etc.), and others.

Precise identification of the emission source of a par-
ticular elements is difficult because of the overlap of 
the individual emission sources (Mikuška et al., 2020; 
Tasić et al, 2017). However, some elements serve as 
markers of a certain emission source, e.g., potassium 
is considered as a good marker for biomass burning, 
while Se, As, and Cd indicate coal combustion and 
Ni and V combustion of oil. Sb, Ba, Zn, Cu, Mn, Tl, 
and Fe are important markers of traffic emissions. 
Increased concentration of thallium in ­PM10 sampled 
in Tulsipur village could indicate combustion of coal 
or production of cement in the cement factory located 
north of Tulsipur (Karbowska, 2016).
From the above, it is clear that the combustion of 
biomass (predominantly wood) and coal combined 
with the dense traffic and street dust resuspension 
is the main reasons of air pollution in the measured 
localities in Tulsipur and Charikot. In addition, the 
incineration of waste in households is another possi-
ble source of elements and PAHs. The cement factory 
located nearby Tulsipur also contributes to the com-
position of ­PM10 aerosols in Tulsipur.
4  Conclusion
In this study, PAHs, hopanes, and elements were 
analyzed in ­PM10 aerosols collected in Tulsipur and 
Charikot in Nepal in monsoon and pre-monsoon 
period. The ­PM10 aerosols and their components were 
analyzed for the first time in these Nepalese cities. 
In addition, the concentrations of hopanes and ele-
ments in ­PM10 aerosols have not yet been measured 
in Nepal.
The WHO 24-h limit value of 50 µg ­m−3 and the 
Nepal concentration limit of 150 µg ­m−3 for human 
health for ­PM10 was significantly exceeded in the 
pre-monsoon periods. The concentrations of ­PM10 
and analyzed organic components (i.e., PAHs and 
hopanes) showed seasonal variations in both Tulsipur 
and Charikot, with lower concentrations in monsoon 
period and the higher values in pre-monsoon period. 
The lower concentration observed during monsoon 
season can be attributed to washout by rainfall of 
aerosols and higher relative humidity of air leading to 
reduced resuspension of street dust.
Traffic, biomass (mainly wood) burning, and 
coal combustion were identified as prevailing local 
sources of PAHs and several elements analyzed in 
­PM10 aerosols sampled in Tulsipur and Charikot. The 
incineration of waste in households was suggested 
as another source of elements and PAHs. Aluminum 
and other elements of Earth crust material in ­PM10 
aerosol samples originate predominantly from street 
dust resuspension. Calcium, thallium, and other ele-
ments found in Tulsipur samples may be emitted by 
the cement factory located nearby Tulsipur. The traf-
fic was suggested as the prevailing emission source of 
hopanes in Tulsipur and Charikot.
The value of diagnostic ratio IndP/(IndP + BghiP) 
during post-monsoon period indicates pollution due 
to combustion of biomass and coal, while during 
pre-monsoon period indicates pollution due to petro-
leum combustion. The ratio Fla / (Fla + Pyr) indicates 
petroleum product combustion during both pre-mon-
soon and monsoon period.
The diagnostic ratio BaP/(BeP + BaP) indicates 
emission of ­PM10 aerosols prevaily from the local 
or nearby regional emission sources in pre-monsoon 
period, while during monsoon period, the ratio for 
both studied localities suggests transport of sampled 
­PM10 aerosols from larger distances.
