Variations in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) due to agriculture crop residue burning (ACRB) on children
between the age group of 10 to 13 years and the young between 20 to 35 years are studied. The effects of
exposure to smoke due to rice–wheat crop residue burning on pulmonary functions like Force Vital Capacity
(FVC), Force Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Force Expiratory Flow
in 25 to 75% of FVC (FEF25–75%) on 40 healthy subjects of rural/agricultural area of Sidhuwal village of Patiala
City were investigated for a period from August 2008 to July 2009. Measurements were taken by spirometry
according to the American Thoracic Society standards. High volume sampler (HVS) and Anderson Impactor
were used to measure the concentration levels of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 in ambient air of the Sidhuwal village.
A signiﬁcant increase in the concentration levels of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 was observed due to which PFTs of
the subjects showed a signiﬁcant decrease in their values, more prominently in the case of children. PFTs of
young subjects recovered up to some extent after the completion of burning period but the PFT values of
children remained signiﬁcantly lower (pb0.001) even after the completion of burning episodes. Small size
particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) affected the PFTs to a large extent in comparison to the large size
particulate matter (SPM). The study indicates that ACRB is a serious environmental health hazard and
children are more sensitive to air pollution, as ACRB poses some unrecoverable inﬂuence on their PFTs.

The study deals with the assessment of health impact and the respective economic cost attributed to particulate
matter (PM) emitted into the atmosphere from biomass burning for space heating, focusing on the differences
between the warm and cold seasons in 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 in Thessaloniki (Greece). Health impact
was assessed based on estimated exposure levels and the use of established WHO concentration–response func-
tions (CRFs) for all-cause mortality, infant mortality, new chronic bronchitis cases, respiratory and cardiac hospi-
tal admissions. Monetary cost was based on the valuation of the willingness-to-pay/accept (WTP/WTA), to avoid
or compensate for the loss of welfare associated with illness.
Results showed that long term mortality during the 2012–2013 winter increased by 200 excess deaths in a city of
almost 900,000 inhabitants or 3540 years of life lost, corresponding to an economic cost of almost 200–250m€.
New chronic bronchitis cases dominate morbidity estimates (490 additional new cases corresponding to a mon-
etary cost of 30m€). Estimated health and monetary impacts are more severe during the cold season, despite its
smaller duration (4 months). Considering that the increased ambient air concentrations (and the integral of out-
door/indoor exposure) are explained by shifting from oil to biomass for domestic heating purposes, several alter-
native scenarios were evaluated. Policy scenario analysis revealed that signiﬁcant public health and monetary
beneﬁts (up to 2b€ in avoided mortality and 130m€ in avoided illness) might be obtained by limiting the biomass
share in the domestic heat energy mix. Fiscal policy affecting fuels/technologies used for domestic heating needs
to be reconsidered urgently, since the net tax loss from avoided oil taxation due to reduced consumption was fur-
ther compounded by the public health cost of increased mid-term morbidity and mortality.

Health implications of air pollution vary dependent upon pollutant sources. This work determines the value, in
terms of reduced mortality, of reducing ambient particulate matter (PM2.5: effective aerodynamic diameter 2.5
μm or less) concentration due to different emission sources. Suva, a Paciﬁc Island city with substantial input
from combustion sources, is used as a case-study. Elemental concentration was determined, by ion beam analysis,
for PM2.5 samples from Suva, spanning one year. Sources of PM2.5 have been quantiﬁed by positive matrix
factorisation. A review of recent literature has been carried out to delineate the mortality risk associated with
these sources. Risk factors have then been applied for Suva, to calculate the possible mortality reduction that
may be achieved through reduction in pollutant levels. Higher risk ratios for black carbon and sulphur resulted
in mortality predictions for PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, road vehicle emissions and waste burning that sur-
pass predictions for these sources based on health risk of PM2.5 mass alone. Predicted mortality for Suva from fos-
sil fuel smoke exceeds the national toll from road accidents in Fiji. The greatest beneﬁt for Suva, in terms of
reduced mortality, is likely to be accomplished by reducing emissions from fossil fuel combustion (diesel), vehi-
cles and waste burning.

"PM2.5 is considered the principal air pollutant caused by open biomass burning (OBB) in Mainland Southeast 
Asia (MSEA) and significant adverse health effects and economic burdens. The goals of this work are to conduct a 
literature review on relative measures of the effect associated with the exposure to OBB emission in MSEA, to 
analyze the impact of OBB emission on PM2.5 concentration in MSEA using the dispersion model, and to estimate 
the public health and economic impacts associated with the exposure to PM2.5 from OBB on regional and na­
tional scales using Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program during a smog episode. This work 
found that OBB was the largest emission source in MSEA, contributing 57% to the PM2.5 concentrations, with the 
substantial OBB impact was found in Northern Laos and Eastern Myanmar. As a result, the exposure to PM2.5 
from OBB was estimated to contribute a substantial number of deaths regarding all-cause (78,276 cases - 95% CI: 
62,915–92,629), respiratory disease (6,716 cases – 95% CI: 3,639–9,482), and cardiovascular disease (1,076 
cases – 95% CI: 490-1,615). The economic impact was estimated at 23.28 billion (95% CI: 18.69–27.57), 1.90 
billion (95% CI: 0.88–2.40), and 0.44 billion (95% CI: 0.20–0.67) USD, respectively. OBB emission caused the 
greatest public health and economic impact in Myanmar, while the smallest impact was found in Cambodia. Our 
study provides policymakers with quantitative estimates of the OBB impacts so that they can develop appropriate 
control measures at the regional and national levels in MSEA.

"Background: Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of air pollution and particulate matter (PM) in Southeast Asia. However, the health effects 
of PM smaller than 10 µm (PM10) originating from BB may differ from those of other sources. This study aimed to estimate the short-term asso­
ciation of PM10 from BB with respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Peninsular Malaysia, a region often exposed to BB events.
Methods: We obtained and analyzed daily data on hospital admissions, PM10 levels and BB days from five districts from 2005 to 2015. We identified 
BB days by evaluating the BB hotspots and backward wind trajectories. We estimated PM10 attributable to BB from the excess of the moving average 
of PM10 during days without BB hotspots. We fitted time-series quasi-Poisson regression models for each district and pooled them using meta- 
analyses. We adjusted for potential confounders and examined the lagged effects up to 3days, and potential effect modification by age and sex.
Results: We analyzed 210 960 respiratory and 178 952 cardiovascular admissions. Almost 50% of days were identified as BB days, with a 
mean PM10 level of 53.1 µg/m3 during BB days and 40.1 µg/m3 during normal days. A 10 µg/m3 increment in PM10 from BB was associated with 
a 0.44% (95% CI: 0.06, 0.82%) increase in respiratory admissions at lag 0–1, with a stronger association in adults aged 15–64 years and 
females. We did not see any significant associations for cardiovascular admissions.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that short-term exposure to PM10 from BB increased the risk of respiratory hospitalizations in Peninsular Malaysia.

"1.  Introduction
In Africa, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) caused 1.1 million premature deaths, when considering ambient and 
household air pollution (361,000 of the deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5) in 2019 (Fisher et al., 2021; Murray 
et al., 2020) making it the leading environmental risk factor for premature death, ahead of unsafe water, unsafe 
sanitation, and handwashing. PM2.5 leads to health impacts because particles can travel far beyond the head 
airways and deposit deep in the tracheobronchial or alveolar region of the respiratory system, depending on the 
diameter of the particle (Hussein et al., 2013; Kodros et al., 2018; Londahl et al., 2009). Long-term exposure 
to PM2.5 has been linked to heart failure, pneumonia, Parkinson's disease, urinary tract infections, dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease, increased risk for psychiatric disorders, depression, anxiety, increased brain inflammation, 
reduced fertility and miscarriages, Ischemic heart disease (IHD), lung cancer (LC), stoke, and chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. (Allen et al., 2016; Braithwaite et al., 2019; Elliott et al., 2013; Grande 
et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2011; Holstius et al., 2012; Ilango & Shaffer, 2020; Johnston et al., 2012; Naeher 
et al., 2007; Peeples, 2020; Stefanidou et al., 2008; Veras et al., 2010). Many people across Africa currently live 
in regions that exceed the World Health Organization's (WHO) newly revised PM2.5 guideline of annual average 
Abstract  Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the second leading risk factor 
of premature death in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use GEOS-Chem to quantify the effects of (a) trash burning, 
(b) residential solid-fuel burning, and (c) open biomass burning (BB) (i.e., landscape fires) on ambient PM2.5 
and PM2.5-attributable mortality in Africa. Using a series of sensitivity simulations, we excluded each of the 
three combustion sources in each of five African regions. We estimate that in 2017 emissions from these three 
combustion sources within Africa increased global ambient PM2.5 by 2%, leading to 203,000 (95% confidence 
interval: 133,000–259,000) premature mortalities yr −1 globally and 167,000 premature mortalities yr −1 in 
Africa. BB contributes more ambient PM2.5-related premature mortalities per year (63%) than residential 
solid-fuel burning (29%) and trash burning (8%). Open BB in Central Africa leads to the largest number of 
PM2.5-attributed mortalities inside the region, while trash burning in North Africa and residential solid-fuel 
burning in West Africa contribute the most regional mortalities for each source. Overall, Africa has a unique 
ambient air pollution profile because natural sources, such as windblown dust and BB, contribute strongly 
to ambient PM2.5 levels and PM2.5-related mortality. Air pollution policies may need to focus on taking 
preventative measures to avoid exposure to ambient PM2.5 from these less-controllable sources.
Plain Language Summary  Air pollution substantially impacts human health in Africa and may 
continue to get worse in the coming years with population and economic growth and urbanization. In this 
modeling study, we estimate the health benefits from removing three combustion sources (trash burning, 
residential biofuel used for home cooking and heating, and open biomass burning) and the regional differences 
across Africa. Our finding suggests that eliminating these sources in Africa can prevent 167,000 premature 
mortalities each year in the continent alone and 203,000 deaths globally. The information we provide may help 
policy makers in developing appropriate policies to mitigate the impacts of air pollution in Africa.

concentration of 5 μg m −3 (Ayetor et al., 2021; WHO, 2021a, 2021b). Additionally, Africa is experiencing rapid 
urbanization, population growth, and a growing economy, and it is projected to grow to 40% of the world's 
population by 2100 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, & Population Division, 2017). 
Africa is projected to have the fastest urban growth rate in the world: by 2050, Africa's cities will be home to 
an additional 950 million people, and the continent's population is anticipated to be primarily urban by 2035 
(OECD/SWAC, 2020). Thus, air pollution is likely to increase and impact more people across the continent in the 
future (Abera et al., 2021; Coker & Kizito, 2018).
The PM2.5 in Africa likely has different physical properties (e.g., size, composition) than PM2.5 in many other 
parts of the world. Compared to other regions of the world, such as North America and Europe, there are rela-
tively few studies on the sources, composition, and health impacts of PM2.5 in Africa (Abera et al., 2021; Katoto 
et al., 2019; Liousse et al., 2014). Important sources of PM2.5 in Africa include waste burning, residential solid-
fuel burning for cooking and heating, and open biomass burning (BB) (Amegah & Agyei-Mensah, 2017; Bearak 
et al., 2021; Mead et al., 2008; Naidja et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2016). We selected these three 
combustion sources because they are more diffuse and inefficient than sources that have been studied in North 
America and Europe (e.g., traffic, industry, power generation). While there are other large sources of PM2.5 on 
the African continent, such as natural dust (Kotsyfakis et al., 2019; Urrutia-Pereira et al., 2021), here, we focus 
on three diffuse combustion sources because they are less controlled across Africa in comparison to other regions 
of the world, are understudied and unique from fossil-fuel sources that have been studied more historically, and 
they may have increased emissions in the future with population growth and climate change.
Although some countries have regulations in place that prohibit open trash burning, waste burning is common 
across Africa due the lack of solid waste collection services, the inability to fund collection programs, and poor 
waste management (Godfrey et al., 2019; Solomon, 2011). Residents in Africa generate low quantities of waste 
when compared to other regions of the world, however, only approximately 44% of waste is collected and the 
future growth rates of waste generation are likely to be large (Godfrey et al., 2019). Sub-Saharan Africa generates 
less than 0.6 kg per capita per day as opposed to an average of 2.2 kg per capita per day in developed countries 
(Hoornweg & Bhada-Tata, 2012). When residents burn waste, toxic gaseous and PM2.5 are emitted (Christian 
et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014), leading to degradation of regional air 
quality.
More than 60% of people who live in Africa still depend on residential combustion of solid fuels such as wood, 
coal, dung, crop waste, and charcoal for household heating and cooking (Bonjour et al., 2013; Eberhard et al., 2008; 
Girard, 2002; World Health Organization. Regional Office for South-East Asia, 2006). When combusted, resi-
dential solid fuels emit high levels PM2.5 with a large fraction composed of black carbon and organic matter. Air 
pollution from residential solid fuels impacts indoor air quality as well as outdoor air quality in regions of heavy 
use. Because of the large electricity deficit in Africa (IEA, 2021) residential solid-fuel use is widespread, thus 
negatively impacting air quality and public health across the region. Population growth in Africa is projected to 
outpace future electricity access gains (IEA, 2021). According to recent studies, there has been a slow decrease in 
the use of residential solid fuel for cooking in Africa but few programs have been created to switch to clean fuels 
for cooking (Stoner et al., 2021).
Across Africa, open BB (i.e., landscape burning) is the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles and 
the second largest source of trace gasses (Aghedo et al., 2007; Andreae & Merlet, 2001; Bond et al., 2004; Giglio 
et al., 2013). Open BB refers to wildfires, prescribed burning, and agricultural fires, and it encompasses a range 
of fuel types (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands). Africa is the largest source of global BB total carbon emissions, 
contributing ∼52% of global BB emissions (Roberts et al., 2009; van der Werf et al., 2003, 2006, 2010). Open 
BB occurs between November and February in the Northern Hemisphere of Africa (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, 
Nigeria, Niger, Cameron, Sudan, Uganda) and June until October in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Congo, 
Angola, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi) (Roberts et al., 2009). 
These emissions have a substantial impact on human health and air quality locally and downwind (Li et al., 2021)
Here, we use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to quantify the effects of three combustion 
sources in Africa: (a) trash burning, (b) residential solid-fuel burning, and (c) open BB across the five regions of 
Africa defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD): North, Southern, West, Central, and East Africa (Figure 
S1 in Supporting Information S1). We present an analysis of a range of regional sensitivity simulations to inves-
tigate the impacts of local emissions and regional transport on ambient PM2.5 levels across Africa. We use the

GBD approach with newly updated concentration-response function from R. Burnett et al. (2018) to estimate the 
PM2.5-attributable mortalities from local and transported air pollution for each of the emissions sources in each of 
five African regions. To our knowledge, very few health impact assessments have been conducted in this region 
of the world for the three combustion sources we address here.
2.  Methods
2.1.  GEOS-Chem Model Configuration
We use the global 3-D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem version v12.6.0 (https://doi.org/10.5281/
zenodo.3507501) aerosol-only simulation with offline oxidation fields (Bey et  al.,  2001; Leibensperger 
et al., 2012; R. J. Park et al., 2004). The model is driven by assimilated meteorological data from the Goddard 
Earth Observing System Forward Processing product (GEOS-FP) provided by the NASA Global Model and 
Assimilation Office (GMAO, https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov). Each GEOS-Chem simulation was conducted at a 
horizontal resolution of 2° × 2.5° (∼222 by 277.5 km) with 47 vertical layers for the year of 2017 with a one 
month spin up. The model produced surface level ambient PM2.5 concentrations over the continent of Africa 
including all emission sources using the following equation.
PM2.5 = 1.33 (NH4 + NIT + SO4) + BCPI + BCPO + 1.5 (OCPO + 1.16 ∗OCPI)
+1.16 ∗SOA + DST1 + 0.38 ∗DST2 + 1.86 ∗SALA

(1)
Equation 1 includes ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NIT), sulfate (SO4), hydrophilic black and organic carbon (BCPI 
and OCPI), hydrophobic black and organic carbon (BCPO and OCPO), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), fine-
mode dust aerosol size bins (DST1 and DST2), and fine-mode sea salt (SALA) to calculate surface level ambient 
PM2.5 at an assumed relative humidity of 35%.
Anthropogenic emissions are based on the Community Emissions Data System GBD-Major Air Pollution 
Sources (CEDSGBD-MAPS) inventory (McDuffie et al., 2020), which is a collection of several inventories and 
includes trash (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014) and residential solid-fuel burning emissions to ambient air in Africa 
(Marais & Wiedinmyer, 2016). There are four open BB emissions inventories available over Africa for use with 
GEOS-Chem: The Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) (Giglio et al., 2013), Fire INventory from NCAR 
(FINN) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2011), Quick Fire Emissions Data set (QFED) (Koster et al., 2015), and the Global 
Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) (Kaiser et al., 2012). (See Text S1 in Supporting Information S1) We conducted 
simulations using each of the four BB emissions inventories to evaluate the impacts of inventory choice on 
surface level ambient PM2.5 estimates over Africa. We used the Mineral Dust Entrainment and Deposition model 
(Zeng et al., 2019) to account for emissions of mineral dust. Sea salt emissions followed (Jaegle et al., 2011).
The 28 simulations presented in this study are summarized in Table 1. The first four simulations were base-case 
simulations that varied the open BB emissions inventory. To evaluate the performance of each open BB inven-
tory, we compared the first four simulations to annually averaged PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) 
by conducting a linear least squares regression (Figure 1 and Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). (See 
Section 2.3 for additional details.) The All_on_QFED simulation better reproduced annually-averaged surface 
level ambient PM2.5 estimates than the simulations that used the other BB emission inventories: thus, we used the 
QFED inventory for the remaining 24 simulations.
The remaining simulations were sensitivity simulations that were used to evaluate the impacts of each of the three 
combustion sources (i.e., trash burning, residential solid-fuel burning, and open BB) by region. By comparing 
each sensitivity simulation with the base case, we isolated the influence of regional emissions and atmospheric 
transport on ambient PM2.5 levels across the continent. We conducted six sensitivity simulations for each of 
the three combustion sources, five simulations where the source was turned off in each of the five African 
regions and one simulation where the source was turned off across the whole African continent. Additionally, we 
conducted a set of six simulations where we turned off all three of the combustion sources together in each of the 
five African regions and across the whole African continent.
2.2.  Health Impact Assessment
We used our base case and sensitivity simulations to estimate the PM2.5-attributable mortalities from local emis-
sions and atmospheric transport across the continent using the GBD approach. To calculate PM2.5-attributable

ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) for five causes of premature mortalities: stroke, LC, IHD, COPD, and 
lower respiratory infections (LRI). Additionally, we used gridded population for 2015 from the NASA Socioec-
onomic Data and Application Center (SEDAC, N. E., 2022). We regridded our model resolution of 2° × 2.5° to 
the population data resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°.
The Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) concentration response function (CRF) was used to relate ambi-
ent PM2.5 exposures to the risk of mortality (R. Burnett et al., 2018) for premature mortalities across all age 
groups. The GEMM was formulated by 41 cohort epidemiological studies in 16 countries (but not including 
any African countries) for adults that are older than 25 years old and assumes all PM2.5 components have equal 
toxicity. We selected this CRF, because it is based on a larger data set with wider geographical coverage and

included a wider range of ambient air pollution exposure levels compared to previous CRF meta analyses. Using 
the GEMM coefficients we report mean premature mortalities including their uncertainty range of ±2 × standard 
error. Further, we acknowledge that our choice of GEMM CRF, which does not include health studies in Africa 
(R. Burnett et al., 2018), assumes equal toxicity for all PM2.5 components (M. Park et al., 2018), and is applied to 
all age groups, will contribute to uncertainty in our mortality estimates. We applied the CRF using the attribution 
method. The equation used to calculate PM2.5-attributable mortality from residential solid-fuel use from emis-
sions in North Africa is provided below.

where MRS_North is defined as the number of premature mortalities attributable to residential solid-fuel combustion 
emissions in North Africa, PM2.5,BASE is the estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations the base case simulation, 
and PM2.5,RS_North is the estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations from each of the simulation where residential 
solid-fuel use emissions were turned off in the North, and MBASE is total PM2.5-related mortalities in the base case 
simulation. For each of the five GBD regions of Africa, we used an equivalent version of Equation 2 to calculate 
the annual premature mortalities attributed to emissions from each combustion source in each region.
Measurement data that is available across Africa suggests that ambient PM2.5 concentrations vary substantially 
throughout Africa (Arku, 2015; Arku et al., 2008). Our model resolution does not capture the spatial variability 
of PM2.5 at the city-scale, which may lead to exposure misclassification. Kodros et al. (2016) suggested that lower 
horizontal model grid resolutions may underestimate the fraction of the population that is exposed to higher PM2.5 
concentrations at least for anthropogenic sources that spatially correlate with where people live, meaning that our 
PM2.5-related mortality values may be biased low.
2.3.  Model Evaluation
Insufficient PM2.5 monitoring data exists across Africa (Martin et al., 2019). Therefore, we used annually aver-
aged PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) to evaluate our simulations. These estimates combine data 
from satellites, ground measurements, and chemical-transport models. We evaluated the model using statistical 
metrics: the slope, coefficient of determination (R 2), mean normalized bias, mean bias (MB), mean normalized

error, mean error, and normalized mean bias (NMB). Hammer et al. (2020) estimates are provided at 0.1° × 0.1° 
degree resolution, so we regridded the data to 2° × 2.5° for the model-estimate comparisons.
3.  Results and Discussion
3.1.  Evaluation of Modeled PM2.5
The global comparison of the Hammer et al. (2020) PM2.5 estimates to the GEOS-Chem estimates for the BASE 
case are given in Figure 1. We acknowledge that the lack of continuous ground-based monitoring of PM2.5 in 
Africa leads to uncertainty in estimated PM2.5 concentrations. The choice and uncertainty of emission inventories 
may also lead to uncertainty in estimated PM2.5 concentrations. Further uncertainty in the percentage of ambient 
PM2.5 that is emitted from a certain source can lead to large uncertainties in premature mortality estimates in 
Africa according Kodros et al. (2018). On an annual global basis compared to Hammer et al. (2020), GEOS-
Chem ambient global PM2.5 estimates have a NMB of −6.9% (Figure 1) a R 2 of 0.776. The negative bias from 
our model ambient PM2.5 will contribute to uncertainties in our PM2.5-attributed premature mortality estimates 
from each of the three combustion sources covered in this study particularly as we cannot evaluate the bias in 
each source separately.
3.2.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for All Three Combustion Sources
Figure  2 shows the percentage change in annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 when all three combustion 
sources are removed. The annual-average percent changes in surface ambient PM2.5 are presented in Table 2. 
Results are presented based on the region of Africa where the air pollution is emitted (i.e., North, Southern, East, 
West, Central) and the region that is impacted by the emissions. In addition to presenting the impacts across the 
five African regions, Table 2 also contains the percent change in ambient PM2.5 concentrations due to emissions 
from each of the five regions to the entire African continent itself and outside of the African continent (Table 2). 
Although the Northern and Southern Hemisphere portions of Africa have different open BB seasons (Ramo 
et al., 2021), we present the annual-average changes in surface ambient PM2.5 because the annual changes are 
used to estimate the impacts of chronic exposure to ambient PM2.5.

Overall, these three combustion sources substantially impact ambient PM2.5 across 
Africa, and they have a non-trivial impact outside of Africa. Across the African conti-
nent, these three sources contribute 28% of annual-average ambient PM2.5 and 6% across 
the globe (Table 2, Figure 2f). Within Africa, the impact is largest over Central Africa, 
where these three combustion sources contribute 72% of the ambient PM2.5 within Africa. 
These  three  sources have the smallest impact on ambient PM2.5 over North Africa (8%).
Across all regions, local emissions from these three sources impact ambient PM2.5 the most 
within the source region itself. For example, local emissions from these three combustion 
sources in Central Africa contribute 49% of the annual average surface ambient PM2.5 within 
that region (Figure 2c), but <10% in the other four African regions. Emissions in Central 
Africa have the largest local impact on ambient PM2.5. The contribution of local emissions 
from these three sources on annual-average ambient PM2.5 concentrations over North Africa 
is the smallest (2%), and this is in part due to the large contribution of dust to ambient PM2.5 
and likely due to a lower population density across the Sahara Desert, which contributes to 
lower emissions in this region.
The impacts of emissions from one region on the annual-average ambient PM2.5 in another 
region depends strongly on meteorology. For example, these three combustion sources in 
East Africa contribute 20% of the annual-average ambient PM2.5 over Central Africa. This 
phenomenon is likely due to the trade winds at these latitudes primarily blowing from East to 
West. Consistent with this, these three combustion sources in Central Africa contribute only 
5% of the annual average ambient PM2.5 within East Africa. These three sources in Central 
Africa contribute 8% of ambient PM2.5 concentrations in the Southern African region due to 
the close proximity of the Southern Africa region to open BB in the southern portion of the 
Central Africa region.
3.3.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Trash Burning
The contribution of trash burning to annual average ambient PM2.5 in each region of Africa 
is shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 and summarized in Table 2. Of the 
three sources investigated here, trash burning contributes the least to annual-average 
ambient PM2.5 (Table 2). Southern Africa contributes the largest percentage of ambient 
PM2.5 from trash burning (1.5% in Southern Africa) followed by East Africa (1.2% in 
East Africa). Although the regional percentages are small, highly populated regions of 
Africa can experience high local ambient PM2.5 contributions from this source. Kodros 
et al. (2016) estimated that the local percent changes of ambient PM2.5 from waste combus-
tion within Africa ranged from 0% to ∼30% in the year 2010. The range of our local percent 
changes (0%–30%) is the same despite using different emissions inventories. The invento-
ries are different because of the assumptions of waste/trash emissions of the CEDSGBD-MAPS 
(McDuffie et  al.,  2020) used in our study. Although CEDSGBD-MAPS incorporated the 
Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) waste combustion inventory, only 30% of generated waste was 
assumed to be combusted as opposed to 60%, as was used in Kodros et al. (2016). The 
reduction was based on a literature survey conducted to understand the fraction of resi-
dential waste that is combusted resulting in the assumption of 30% of uncollected waste is 
burnt by weight in CEDSGBD-MAPS (McDuffie et al., 2020).
Transported air pollution from trash burning had only minor impacts on ambient PM2.5 
concentrations outside of the region where the emissions originated from due to the small 
magnitude of this source. Consistent with the impacts of transport for all three combustion 
sources combined, trash emissions from East Africa have the largest relative impact on ambi-
ent PM2.5 in Central Africa, but even this impact is minor (∼0.3% of annual average ambient 
PM2.5).

3.4.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Residential Solid-Fuel Burning
The contribution of residential solid biofuel burning to annual-average ambient PM2.5 is shown in Figure S4 in 
Supporting Information S1 and summarized in Table 2. Residential combustion is the second largest contributor 
to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 (5%) over Africa when compared to trash (1%) and open BB (22%). 
Residential combustion in East Africa makes the largest local contribution to annual-average surface ambient 
PM2.5 (9% in East Africa) followed by Central Africa (2% in Central Africa). Emissions from this source make 
only a minor contribution (1%) to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 in North Africa. The largest changes in 
regions outside of a source region due to transport were again from emissions in East Africa, where East Africa 
contributes 2% and 1% of the annual average ambient PM2.5 over Central Africa and Southern Africa, respectively.
3.5.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Open BB
Maps showing the contribution of open BB to annual-average ambient PM2.5 in Africa are displayed in Figure 
S5 in Supporting Information S1 with the percentage changes summarized in Table 2. Of the three sources 
investigated here, open BB in Africa makes the largest contribution to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 
across Africa (22%) and globally (5%). Across all the regions, open BB in Central Africa makes the largest local 
contribution to annual-average ambient PM2.5 (45% in Central), followed by meaningful contributions in East 
(21% in East) and Southern Africa (15% in Southern). In contrast, the contribution is much smaller over West 
(5% in West) and North Africa (1% in North). Roberts et al. (2009) reported that most open BB in Africa occurs 
in woodland regions, which is the land cover type primarily found in Central Africa.
Compared to the other two combustion sources, open BB emissions makes a larger contribution to annual-average 
surface ambient PM2.5 concentrations outside of individual source regions. For example, turning off open BB 
emissions in Central Africa decreased ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Southern Africa by 8%, and turning off 
emissions in East Africa reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Central Africa by 17%. Open BB has larger 
impacts because the emissions are greater than trash and residential solid-fuel combustion and because emissions 
from open BB may be lofted to outside of the planetary boundary layer resulting in a longer atmospheric lifetime, 
which increases the likelihood that they will be transported over longer distances (Paugam et al., 2016).
3.6.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality
The annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities attributable to emissions from all three combustion sources from 
each of the African regions and the entire continent are shown in Figure 3. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 but shows 
results for annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities, rather than changes in ambient PM2.5. Using our base-
case scenario, we find that there are 7.6 million (95% confidence interval: 5.3–9.4) annual PM2.5-attributable 
premature mortalities globally from the five causes of death explored here (see Section 2.2). Our global annual

global premature mortality estimates are similar to R. Burnett et al. (2018) of 8.9 million 
(7.5–10.3) and Lelieveld et  al.  (2020) of 8.8 million (7.11–10.41) deaths. Of these 7.6 
million PM2.5-attributable premature deaths, we find that 203,000 (95% confidence interval: 
133,000–259,000) annual global premature mortalities are attributable to emissions from the 
combination of three combustion sources in Africa, or 10% of total global ambient PM2.5 
premature mortalities. Of the 203,000 annual mortalities attributable to these three sources, 
167,000 of these annual mortalities are within the African continent, which represents 25% of 
total PM2.5 related premature mortalities in Africa. The PM2.5-attributable premature moral-
ities from these sources represent 2% of total annual PM2.5-related premature moralities in 
North Africa, 5% in Southern Africa, 10% in East Africa, 49% in West Africa, and 10% in 
Central Africa.
Following the changes in ambient PM2.5, we found that annual PM2.5-attributable prema-
ture mortalities were mainly driven by emissions within their own region, while transported 
ambient PM2.5 to the surrounding regions resulted in fewer premature mortalities. The largest 
ambient PM2.5 emissions are in West Africa, and these led to the highest number of local 
mortalities when considering all three combustion sources, that is, 43,000 PM2.5-attributable 
mortalities per year in this region. In contrast, Central Africa also has a large number of 
annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities (35,000 mortalities per year) despite the fact that these 
three combustion sources are responsible for larger contributions to ambient PM2.5, compared 
to other regions. This is due to the larger population numbers. Further, despite contributing to 
a relatively large percent of ambient PM2.5 in Southern Africa, these three sources only cause 
9,000 annual PM2.5-attributable deaths in the region.
3.7.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Trash Burning
The map of our estimates of premature mortalities attributed to trash-burning ambient PM2.5 
is shown in Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1 with results summarized in Table 3. We 
find that 11,200 premature mortalities are attributable to ambient PM2.5 from trash combus-
tion across Africa. Of the five regions, the largest number of PM2.5-attributable premature 
mortalities occurs in North Africa (∼5,000 deaths). Kodros et al. (2016) attributed 19,000 
premature adult mortalities to waste combustion PM2.5 in Africa for the year of 2010. This 
estimate is relatively close to the premature mortalities found in our study. These are a few 
differences in the emissions inventories used between the two studies and they also used a 
different concentration-response function. On the other hand, when we compared our esti-
mates to McDuffie et al. (2021) which also used CEDSGBD-MAPS, our estimates are close to 
their premature mortality estimates of 16,000 deaths. Although McDuffie et al. (2021) used 
the same inventory and GEMM concentration-response function, they attributed premature 
mortality estimates to six causes of premature death (IHD, stroke, COPD, LC, LRI, and type 
II diabetes), whereas we use five causes of death for all age groups in our estimates.
3.8.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Residential Burning
We attribute 49,000 annual premature mortalities to ambient PM2.5 from residential solid-
fuel burning in Africa. The regional map of premature mortalities attributed to this source of 
ambient PM2.5 is shown in Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1. Residential combustion 
contributes to the fewest number of PM2.5-attributable mortalities in Southern Africa. On the 
other hand, residential combustion leads to the most premature mortalities in West Africa 
(21,700 mortalities per year). The relatively large population in this region contributes to 
the higher mortality estimates. The effect of population is evident between the contrast of 
Table 2 with Table 3. When residential biofuel burning was removed in West Africa PM2.5 
concentrations were only reduced by 3% within the region (second smallest of any region's 
self-effect). However, this removal led to the most premature mortalities within the source 
region of any of the five regions. The West Africa region is one of the largest populated 
regions in Africa.

Note. The horizontal axis indicates the region where the emissions were turned off, while the vertical axis indicates the region where the mortality was calculated. In addition to the five regions (i.e., 
North, Southern, East, West, and Central), we calculated the mortality across the continent of Africa (indicated by the word Africa) and outside of Africa (indicated by the words Total out). Units are in 
attributable mortalities per year.

3.9.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Open BB
Following the effects on ambient PM2.5 concentrations, open BB contributes to the largest number of annual 
PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1, Table 3). In Africa, this source 
amounts to 106,200 annual premature mortalities, and outside of Africa, it amounts to 20,500 annual premature 
mortalities. Bauer et al. (2019) estimated that open BB leads to 43,000 annual premature deaths in Africa, which 
is lower than our findings. We found that emissions from open BB in Central Africa lead to the largest number of 
annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities within that region (31,000 in Central Africa), and contribute to the largest 
number of PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities across all of Africa (48,300 mortalities per year). Open BB 
in West Africa leads to the second largest number of annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities across the continent, 
with 18,700 in West Africa and 19,900 across all of Africa. Additionally, compared to the other regions, open BB 
in East Africa leads to the largest number of PM2.5-attributable mortalities outside of Africa (8,800 mortalities 
per year).
While previous studies have not investigated all three of these three sources in Africa directly, several studies 
have looked at similar sectors or have included one or more of these sources in health-impact assessments. 
Lacey et al. (2017) estimated 13,210 annual premature deaths from anthropogenic activity (including trans-
portation, household energy generation, waste burning, and home heating and cooking but not open BB) in 
Africa by implementing the Diffuse and Inefficient Combustion Emissions in Africa (DICE-Africa) (Marais & 
Wiedinmyer, 2016) and the 2010 Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutant emissions inventories for 2006. The 
Lacey et al. (2017) study used the Integrated Exposure-Response model (IER) (R. T. Burnett et al., 2014) that 
incorporates relative risk information from ambient air pollution, second tobacco smoke, household solid fuel 
for cooking, and active smoking to estimate premature mortalities for five causes of death including IHD, stroke, 
COPD, and LC. The IER generally produces lower PM2.5-attributable mortality estimates than the GEMM func-
tion that we used in this study. Hence, these lower annual premature mortality estimates from Lacey et al. (2017) 
attributed to anthropogenic activity may be due to the use of this IER model in addition to not including BB. On 
the other hand, Bauer et al. (2019) estimated 780,000 premature deaths annually from PM2.5 from desert dust, 
all anthropogenic activity, and BB in Africa for 2016. In the terms of premature mortalities due to fossil-fuel 
combustion in Africa (not covered in our study), Vohra et al. (2021) calculated 194,000 premature mortalities 
annually in Africa due to fossil-fuel combustion from power generation, industry, ships, aircraft, ground trans-
portation, backup generators, kerosene, and oil/gas extraction for the year 2012. Marais et al. (2019) attributed 
79,000 premature deaths from exposure to ambient PM2.5 fossil fuel use from 2015 emissions in Africa. None of 
these studies are directly comparable to ours due to factors such as differences in sources investigated, emissions 
inventories, atmospheric models, and concentration-response functions. However, despite these differences, the 
estimated number of annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities provided here are similar in magnitude, support-
ing the validity of our results.
4.  Conclusion
We use the GEOS-Chem chemical-transport model to estimate the annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 concen-
trations and annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities from three combustion sources (trash burning, resi-
dential solid-fuel use, and open BB) across Africa for 2017. We estimate the impacts of these three combustion 
sources across five regions of Africa (as defined by the GBD), including both the impacts of emissions from 
each region to each of the African regions as well as outside of Africa. Via a set of sensitivity simulations, we 
show that these sources lead to 203,000 annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities globally and 167,000 
annual premature mortalities in Africa. Ambient PM2.5 from these three combustion sources leads to a substan-
tial number of premature mortalities in Africa compared to the deaths from communicable diseases, such as the 
Ebola Virus (∼11,000 deaths from 2014 to 2016) (Bell, 2016). To our knowledge there are very few health impact 
assessments in this region of the world that are focused on the three combustion sources we examined here.
Overall, the largest impact of PM2.5 emissions occurs in the region of Africa where the emissions occur. However, 
emissions from some regions have substantial impacts on neighboring regions. For example, in East Africa these 
three combustion sourced had substantial impacts on PM2.5 concentrations in Central Africa due to the predom-
inant East-West wind patterns in the tropics. Of the three sources, open BB has the largest impact on ambient 
PM2.5 and annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities in Africa (106,000 per year), followed by residential 
solid-fuel combustion (49,000 per year), and trash combustion (11,000 per year).

Overall, Africa has a unique ambient air pollution profile because sources such as windblown dust and BB 
contribute strongly to PM2.5 levels and PM2.5-related mortality. Although open BB has the largest health impacts, 
this source is probably one of the most difficult of three sources to control or regulate in Africa. Trash and 
residential solid-fuel emissions may be mitigated more easily through financial investments in municipal trash 
collection programs and/or assistance programs that help finance conversions from residential solid-fuel use to 
electric stoves (as well as electrification of rural/remote African regions in general).

"Uncontrolled combustion of domestic waste has been observed in many countries, creating concerns
for air quality; however, the health implications have not yet been quantiﬁed. We incorporate the
Wiedinmyer et al (2014 Environ. Sci. Technol. 48 9523–30) emissions inventory into the global
chemical-transport model, GEOS-Chem, and provide a ﬁrst estimate of premature adult mortalities
from chronic exposure to ambient PM2.5 from uncontrolled combustion of domestic waste. Using the
concentration-response functions (CRFs) of Burnett et al (2014 Environ. Health Perspect. 122
397–403), we estimate that waste-combustion emissions result in 270 000 (5th–95th:
213 000–328 000) premature adult mortalities per year. The conﬁdence interval results only from
uncertainty in the CRFs and assumes equal toxicity of waste-combustion PM2.5 to all other PM2.5
sources. We acknowledge that this result is likely sensitive to choice of chemical-transport model,
CRFs, and emission inventories. Our central estimate equates to 9% of adult mortalities from
exposure to ambient PM2.5 reported in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. Exposure to PM2.5
from waste combustion increases the risk of premature mortality by more than 0.5% for greater than
50% of the population. We consider sensitivity simulations to uncertainty in waste-combustion
emission mass, the removal of waste-combustion emissions, and model resolution. A factor-of-2
uncertainty in waste-combustion PM2.5 leads to central estimates ranging from 138 000 to 518 000
mortalities per year for factors-of-2 reductions and increases, respectively. Complete removal of waste
combustion would only avoid 191 000 (5th–95th: 151 000–224 000) mortalities per year (smaller than
the total contributed premature mortalities due to nonlinear CRFs). Decreasing model resolution
from 2°×2.5° to 4°×5° results in 16% fewer mortalities attributed to waste-combustion PM2.5,
and over Asia, decreasing resolution from 0.5°×0.666° to 2°×2.5° results in 21% fewer mortalities
attributed to waste-combustion PM2.5. Owing to coarse model resolution, our global estimates of
premature mortality from waste-combustion PM2.5 are likely a lower bound.

Abstract
Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that biomass open-burning (BOB) related air pollution has been associ­
ated with adverse health effect, but limited evidence is found in Thailand. We investigated the effects of BOB occurrence 
on outpatient department (OPD) visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Thailand and further explored the 
effects of longer exposure duration and higher exposure intensity to BOB. Fire hotspot data were acquired from the Vis­
ible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) 
satellite during January 2016 through December 2020 across Thailand, and OPD visits data were obtained from the 
National Health Security Office during the same period. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic 
regression was used to examine province-specific estimates of BOB-related air pollution on OPD visits, controlling for 
many possible confounders, and random-effect meta-analysis was then applied to derive the national estimate. Odds ratio 
(ORs) of cardiovascular and respiratory OPD visits on the day of BOB occurrence was 1.0105 (95% CI: 0.9971, 1.0240) 
at lag 5 days and 1.0131 (95% CI: 1.0050, 1.0213) at current day, respectively. ORs of cardiovascular and respiratory 
OPD visits associated with longer exposure duration to BOB was 1.0272 (95% CI: 1.0104, 1.0442) and 1.0275 (95% CI: 
1.0139, 1.0413), respectively. Higher exposure intensity to BOB was not significantly associated with OPD visits for both 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Findings from this study can be used to establish the warning systems associated 
with exposure to BOB-related air pollution to reduce adverse health effects in Thailand.

human health problems (Vichit-Vadakan and Vajanapoom 
2011). The various sources of air pollution in Thailand have 
been observed depending upon location, where traffic emis­
sion and biomass open burning (BOB) have been found 
as the major source of air pollution in Bangkok. Specifi­
cally, vehicle emission contributed to approximately 33% 
of PM10 and 32% of PM2.5 mass, whereas BOB contributed 
to approximately 33% of PM10 and 26% of PM2.5 mass at 
traffic locations (Chuersuwan et al. 2008). In Pathum Thani, 
an adjacent province of Bangkok, the two major sources of 
air pollution were vehicle emission and BOB as well. In 
particular, vehicle emission contributed to approximately 
28% and 27% of total PM2.5 mass during wet and dry sea­
son, respectively whereas 26% and 41% of total PM2.5 con­
centration was contributed from BOB during wet and dry 
season, respectively (Narita et al. 2019). The vegetation 
burning was also observed as the largest contributor to PM10 
concentration in Chiang Mai and Lamphun, the provinces 
in the northern part of Thailand, contributing to 46–82% 
of total PM10 concentration (Pengchai et al. 2009). There­
fore, BOB is considered as a significant source of air pol­
lution emission in Thailand (Yin et al. 2019) that generally 
increases the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CH4, CO, CO2, 
N2O and NO2 in the ambient air (Boonman et al. 2014). The 
potential sources of BOB that influence air quality are var­
ied in different regions of Thailand. Specifically, air pollu­
tion derived from BOB in the Northern region is originally 
emitted from the local residue burning activities (Kumar et 
al. 2020), whereas that in the Southern region is sometime 
likely to occur from the transboundary air pollution (Phairu­
ang et al. 2020).
A previous epidemiological study conducted in Malaysia 
has indicated that exposure to PM10 emitted from BOB was 
significantly associated with increased risk of non-accidental 
and respiratory mortality at various lag structures (Sahani et 
al. 2014) and the health impact assessment study conducted 
in Thessaloniki, Greece showed that PM2.5 emitted from 
BOB contributed to an increase of 200 premature deaths or 
3,540 years of life lost in 2012–2013 winter compared to the 
same period of 2011–2012, corresponding to the economic 
burden up to 1.2  billion euros (Sarigiannis et al. 2015). 
Furthermore, a previous study conducted in eight Northern 
provinces of Thailand, the region with the most serious air 
pollution situation contributed from BOB, revealed that an 
increase of 10 µg/m3 in PM10 concentration on the same day 
(lag 0) was associated with 2.00% (95% CI: 1.20, 2.80) and 
2.00% (95% CI: 0.40, 3.50) increased risk of outpatient vis­
its for chronic lower respiratory disease and cerebrovascular 
disease, respectively (Mueller et al. 2020). Although such 
studies examined the effect of BOB related air pollution on 
premature mortality, limited evidence on the effect of expo­
sure to BOB occurrence, as well as exposure duration and 
intensity to BOB related air pollution on human health is 
available in Thailand to date. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate the effects of short-term exposure to BOB occur­
rence on cardiovascular and respiratory outpatient depart­
ment (OPD) visits in Thailand. The risk of longer exposure 
duration and higher exposure intensity to BOB related air 
pollution on OPD visits was also examined.
2  Methods
Thailand consists of 77 administrative provinces. The total 
area of Thailand is approximately 500 km2 with roughly 
70 million populations in 2020. Thailand is divided into six 
regions according to the Thai Meteorological Department, 
including Northern, Northeastern, Central, Eastern, South­
ern East-Coast and Southern West-Coast (Fig.  1A). This 
study was conducted in 37 out of 77 provinces because of a 
limited air pollution and meteorological data (Fig. 1B).
2.1  Fire hotspot data
Fire hotspot data from the Fire Information for Resource 
Management System (FIRMS) distributes Near Real-Time 
(NRT) active fire data of satellite observations under the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
was used as the proxy of BOB in this study. In particular, fire 
hotspot data was acquired from the Visible Infrared Imag­
ing Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National 
Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, where 
the Suomi NPP VIIRS instrument has the overpass local 
time (LT) at around 1:00–3:00 PM LT with spatial resolu­
tion of 375 × 375 m2 (https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/
find-data/near-real-time/firms/viirs-i-band-375-m-active-
fire-data). Because of the quality of individual fire hotspot 
pixels is different depending upon the relative temperature 
anomaly and the potential sun glint contamination, this 
study considered only the nominal and high confidence fire 
hotspot pixels with vegetation burning point. The number 
of fire hotspot was then summed by date and province dur­
ing January 2016 through December 2020 and BOB occur­
rence day was defined when fire hotspot was detected in that 
particular day regardless how many fire hotspot counts was 
observed. Specifically, a day with active fire hotspot occur­
rence was assigned as 1, otherwise 0.
2.2  Air pollution and meteorological data
Hourly air pollution (particulate matter with aerodynamic 
diameter less than or equal to 10 μm: PM10 (µg/m3), nitro­
gen dioxide; NO2 (ppb), and ozone; O3 (ppb)) and meteo­
rological data (temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%)) 
1 3
2886Stochastic Environmental Research and Risk Assessment (2023) 37:2885–2895
was obtained from air quality monitoring stations operated 
by Thailand Pollution Control Department (PCD) under the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment during Jan­
uary 2016 through December 2020. Daily average concen­
tration of individual air pollutants, temperature, and relative 
humidity was calculated by taking the average of hourly data 
within the same day, but the day that had missing data more 
than 6 h was considered as missing. The missing of indi­
vidual air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity was 
then imputed using the expectation – maximization (EM) 
algorithm under the assumptions of a multivariate normal 
distribution (Junger and Ponce de Leon 2015). In case there 
are many monitoring stations situated in the same province, 
daily concentration of air pollutants, ambient temperature, 
and relative humidity from all available monitoring stations 
located in the same province were then averaged and uti­
lized as a proxy for daily exposure.
2.3  Outpatient department (OPD) visits data
Daily number of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respira­
tory disease was obtained from the National Health Security 
Office (NHSO) during the same period as of fire hotspot, air 
pollution, and weather variables. The OPD visits data under 
the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) scheme was consid­
ered in this study with anonymously recorded by age, sex, 
date of OPD visits, and primary diagnostic code according 
to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision 
(ICD-10), where I00-I99 has been coded for total cardio­
vascular disease and J00-J99 for total respiratory disease. 
This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of 
the Mahidol University Faculty of Public Health as research 
with exemption category (Protocol No. 145/2564).

Moreover, to examine the province-specific effect of longer 
exposure duration to BOB on OPD visits, a dummy variable 
of two or more consecutive day of fire hotspot occurrence 
was fitted in the conditional logistic regression model con­
trolling for temperature and relative humidity as shown in 
the following equation;
logit (Py=1i) = α + βi ∗DURt,i + ns (tmeant,i, df = 3) + ns (humidt,i, df = 3) + stratumt,i
(2)
Where DURt,i indicates the dummy variable for the longer 
duration of exposure to BOB at day t and province i, defined 
by two or more consecutive days of fire hotspot occurrence. 
Specifically, a day with two or more consecutive days of 
active fire hotspot occurrence at particular province was 
assigned as 1, otherwise 0. This method was used to inspect 
whether or not exposure to BOB related air pollutant for 
more than one day is associated with higher estimated effect 
on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases 
than that up to one day.
The province-specific effect of higher exposure intensity 
to BOB on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
disease was also investigated by fitting an indicator variable 
for higher exposure intensity to BOB, defined by daily aver­

2.4  Statistical analysis
The time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional 
logistic regression was used to examine the province-spe­
cific association between BOB related air pollution and OPD 
visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In par­
ticular, this design generally takes into account comparison 
between case and control periods, where each case serves as 
his/her own control but in different periods of time (Maclure 
1991). In this study, exposure to BOB related air pollution 
at the date of OPD visits (case day) was compared with 
that in the same day of the week within the same calendar 
month of the same year (control days). This design is there­
fore automatically controlled for day of the week, long-term 
trend and seasonality by design that assumed to be constant 
within the same stratum. To explore province-specific effect 
of BOB occurrence on OPD visits, the indicator variable for 
of fire hotspot occurrence was fitted in the conditional logis­
tic regression model adjusting for temperature and relative 
humidity using the natural cubic spline function with three 
degrees of freedom at moving average lag 0–3 days for both 
temperature and relative humidity because previous studies 
purported that adjusting for temperature and relative humid­
ity at lag 0–3 days did not confound the estimates of the 
association between air pollution and health outcome (Lin 
et al. 2013; Thongphunchung et al. 2021). The maximum 
adequate model was selected based on minimizing Bayesian 
Information Criterion (BIC) value, in which three degrees 
of freedom of the natural cubic splines function for both 
temperature and relative humidity provided the lowest BIC 
value that was then used as the best model fit in this study 
(Table S1). The following equation was used to investigate 
the association between BOB related air pollution and OPD 
visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in this 
study.
logit (Py=1i) = α + βi ∗BOBt,i + ns (tmeant.i, df = 3) + ns (humidt,i, df = 3) + stratumt,i
(1)
Where logit(Py=1i) is the natural logarithm of odds ratio 
comparing case and control days within the same stratum 
at province i; α is the model intercept; BOBt,i is the indica­
tor variable of fire hotspot occurrence at day t and prov­
ince i ; βi is the coefficient of BOB occurrence associated 
with OPD visits at province i; ns(●) is the natural cubic 
splines function with three degrees of freedom; tmeant,i and 
humidt,i define daily mean temperature and relative humid­
ity at day t and province i, respectively; stratumt,i defines 
the case and control day within the same stratum t at prov­
ince i. The effect of BOB occurrence on OPD visits was 
examined until lag 7 days using unconstrained distributed 
lag model because the preliminary analysis indicated that 
the estimated effect was relatively constant after 7 days lag.

high exposure intensity compared to that in the days with 
low intensity (p-value < 0.001) (Table S3). The total number 
of OPD visits for cardiovascular disease over 37 provinces 
during the study period was 50,302,593 cases (Table  2), 
ranged from 266,955 cases in Mae Hong Son to 4,683,507 
cases in Bangkok, whereas that for respiratory disease 
was 46,845,417 cases with the minimum number of cases 
observed in Samut Songkhram (316,931 cases) and maxi­
mum number in Nakhon Ratchasima (4,092,245 cases). The 
prevalence rate of OPD visits for cardiovascular disease per 
1000 populations during the study period was 1,324, ranged 
from 825 in Bangkok to 2,772 in Phrae, whereas those for 
respiratory disease was 1,233, ranged from 412 in Bangkok 
to 1,836 in Yala (Table S4). There was an average of 399 
days that were assigned as longer exposure duration (a day 
with two or more consecutive days of active fire hotspot 
occurrence) during the study period. The daily average 
PM10 concentration for the days with longer exposure dura­
tion was 64.02 µg/m3 and daily mean number of OPD visits 
for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases was 883 and 769 
cases, respectively (Table S5). During the study period, 435 
days were assigned as higher exposure intensity with daily 
average PM10 concentration of 60.87 µg/ m3 and daily mean 
number of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases of 889 and 739 cases, respectively (Table S6).
The association between BOB occurrence and OPD vis­
its for cardiovascular and respiratory disease at different 
lag structures is shown in Fig. 2. The effect of BOB occur­
rence on cardiovascular OPD visits at national level was the 
highest at lag 5 days. In particular, the ORs of cardiovas­
cular OPD visits associated with BOB occurrence day was 
1.0105 (95% CI: 0.9971, 1.0240), compared to non-BOB 
occurrence day. The significant heterogeneity of the effect 
estimate among provinces was found with I2 of 99.3% and 
is within-province variance and τ2 indicates between-prov­
ince variance.
The sensitivity analysis was also performed by changing 
degree of freedom of the natural cubic spline function for 
temperature and relative humidity that were used as con­
founding factors on the association between BOB and OPD 
visits. The quartile cut-off point for defining higher expo­
sure intensity to BOB occurrence was also varied to explore 
the robustness of the effect estimates. The estimates of 
BOB occurrence and those of longer exposure duration and 
higher exposure intensity to BOB-related air pollution were 
also adjusted for other air pollutants by incorporating other 
air pollutants into the model one at a time. All analyses were 
performed using R packages for statistical computing (Ver­
sion 4.1.0), where “survival” and “splines” packages were 
used to analyse province-specific effect of BOB on OPD 
visits, whereas the “metafor” package was used to perform 
the random-effect meta-analysis. The result was presented 
as odds ratio (ORs) with its 95% confidence interval (CI).
3  Results
The average number of fire hotspot occurrence over 37 
provinces during the study period was 563 out of 1,827 
days (Table 1), ranged from 10 days in Samut Songkhram 
to 1,119 days in Nakhon Sawan (Table S2). Daily aver­
age concentration ± standard deviation (SD) of PM10, O3, 
and NO2 during the study period was 35.7 ± 22.4  µg/m3, 
36.8 ± 18.7 ppb, and 9.8 ± 6.2 ppb, respectively. Mean­
while, daily average temperature and relative humidity 
was 27.0 ± 7.7 oC and 71.6 ± 22.7%, respectively (Table 1). 
The spatial variations for fire hotspot and PM10 concentra­
tion during the study period are indicated in Fig. S1. The 
daily average PM10 concentration was significantly differ­
ent between the day with and without burning occurrence 
(p-value < 0.001), where higher concentration was observed 
in the days with fire hotspot occurrence. Similarly, PM10 
concentration was significantly different between 1-day 
exposure and longer exposure duration (p-value < 0.001). 
Moreover, PM10 concentration was higher in the days with

of OPD visits for cardiovascular disease with ORs of 1.0272 
(95% CI: 1.0104, 1.0442) (I2 = 99.4% and p-value from 
Cochran’s Q test < 0.001) and respiratory diseases with ORs 
of 1.0275 (95% CI: 1.0139, 1.0413) (I2 = 99.0% and p-value 
from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001). Nevertheless, we did not 
observe the significant effect of higher exposure intensity 
to BOB (daily average PM10 concentration higher than 
1st quartile on fire hotspot occurrence day) on OPD visits, 
where ORs of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respira­
tory diseases associated with exposure to higher intensity of 
BOB was 0.9828 (95% CI: 0.9641, 1.0018) (I2 = 99.4% and 
p-value from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001) and 0.9936 (95% CI: 
0.9831, 1.0049) (I2 = 97.8% and p-value from Cochran’s Q 
test < 0.001), respectively. The province-specific effects of 
longer exposure duration and higher exposure intensity to 
BOB related air pollution on OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory diseases are shown in Tables S8 and S9, 
respectively.
The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that the effects 
of exposure to BOB, as well as its longer duration and higher 
intensity, on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases were not different even when degrees of freedom 
of the natural cubic splines function for daily temperature 
and relative humidity was varied (Fig. 3 and Table S10). 
Furthermore, when we changed the definition of higher 
exposure intensity, the effect estimate of higher exposure 
intensity to BOB on cardiovascular and respiratory OPD 
visits was relatively robust (Table 4). The estimate of BOB 
occurrence, longer exposure duration, and higher exposure 
intensity on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
p-value from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001. Moreover, the high­
est estimate of BOB occurrence on respiratory OPD vis­
its was observed at current day lag (lag 0), where ORs of 
respiratory OPD visits associated with BOB occurrence was 
1.0131 (95% CI: 1.0050, 1.0213). The significant difference 
on the effect estimates among provinces was also observed 
with I2 of 97.6% and p-value from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001. 
The province-specific ORs of OPD visits for cardiovascular 
and respiratory disease associated with BOB occurrence at 
different lag structures is shown in Table S7.

and intensity to BOB on OPD visits for cardiovascular and

intensity to BOB on OPD visits for cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases in Thailand during the period spanning 
from January 2016 to December 2020. The results indicate 
that BOB occurrence day was associated with higher risk 
of cardiovascular and respiratory OPD visits compared to 
non-BOB occurrence day. The negative effect of exposure 
to BOB on cardiovascular OPD visits was found at lag 1 
(Fig. 2). This finding may be due in part to the harvesting 
effect, where the susceptible persons may visit the OPD 
due to cardiovascular disease at earlier time after expo­
sure, leading to a fewer number of OPD visits at later lag 
(Schwartz 2001; Zanobetti et al. 2002). Longer exposure 
duration to BOB was also associated with increased risk of 
cardiovascular and respiratory OPD visits. Higher exposure 
intensity was not significantly associated with OPD visits 
for both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The effect 
estimates were robust even when changing degrees of free­
dom of the natural cubic spline function for adjusting tem­
perature and relative humidity and varying the definition of 
higher exposure intensity, as well as after adjusting for other 
air pollutants.
The estimated risk of cardiovascular and respiratory OPD 
visits associated with BOB occurrence was 1.0105 (95% CI: 
0.9971, 1.0240) and 1.0131 (95% CI: 1.0050, 1.0213) times 
higher than non-BOB occurrence. This finding is similar to 
disease was robust even after adjusting for other air pollut­
ants (Table S11).

and respiratory OPD visits than shorter exposure duration, 
respectively. These findings have been supported by the 
concept of the continuous exposure to high concentrations 
of particulate matter reporting that higher exposure to wild­
fire-related particulate matter was associated with increased 
burden of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospi­
tal admission (Requia et al. 2021; Ye et al. 2021). Specifi­
cally, exposure to biomass smoke activates the production 
of many pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 
(IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α), thereby causing intracellular damage through the 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reduc­
tion of antioxidant mechanisms. This would induce chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and increase burden of respi­
ratory morbidity (De Oliveira Alves et al. 2017; Dutta et 
al. 2013; Silva et al. 2015). Moreover, higher exposure to 
smoke particles can affect cardiovascular system through 
inhalation pathway, where inhaled particle may penetrate 
into the circulatory system via the air-blood barrier (Wu 
et al. 2018), leading to oxidative stress, activation of auto­
nomic reflex, and systemic inflammation (Chen et al. 2021). 
Avoiding longer exposure to BOB related air pollution that 
last for many days might be difficult because of daily activi­
ties, but finding of this study can be useful for establishing 
the warning system of BOB-related air pollution in Thailand 
taken into account exposure duration to prevent harmful 
health effect of BOB-related air pollution since there was no 
official BOB warning system in Thailand to date.
We observed the negative association between higher 
exposure intensity to BOB and OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory disease, although there was statistically 
insignificant. This might be due in part to the effectiveness 
of protective practices in which people may spend less time 
outdoor during high concentration of particulate matter 
emitted by biomass burning in order to avoid exposure (De 
Pretto et al. 2015). Moreover, people may wear face masks 
in outdoor activities or use air purifier indoor when severe 
haze concentration has been reported upon checking the rel­
evant air quality index (AQI) on daily basis (Majumder et 
al. 2019; Sereenonchai et al. 2020). However, this negative 
association may also be observed by chance.
Several limitations of this study are acknowledged. First, 
we applied fire hotspot data from the Suomi NPP VIIRS 
instrument as indicator for the occurrence of BOB-related 
air pollution, which might not accurately represent the emis­
sion of air pollution from BOB because satellite observation 
sometimes cannot detect fire emission even when substantial 
amount of grounded-levels particles was emitted by BOB 
(Johnston et al. 2018). In case of few points of fire hotspot 
included, it may not significantly increase the concentration 
of air pollutants on that particular day which means that the 
main contributor may be originated from other sources such 
the result observed in previous studies in the upper North­
ern of Thailand, indicating that every 10 µg/m3 increase of 
PM10 on biomass burning day was associated with increased 
risk of OPD visits for respiratory diseases (Mueller et al. 
2020; Uttajug et al. 2021). We also observed that the occur­
rence of BOB was significantly associated with respiratory 
OPD visits, but was not significantly associated with car­
diovascular OPD visits, which is in agreement with previ­
ous studies (Johnston et al. 2014; Karanasiou et al. 2021; 
Martin et al. 2013). This finding might be speculated that 
there is no truly association between BOB occurrence and 
cardiovascular OPD visits or it could reflect the heteroge­
neity of the effect estimates among provinces. Neverthe­
less, the plausible mechanism underlying the effect of BOB 
occurrence on cardiovascular diseases has been suggested. 
In particular, exposure to smoke particles is likely to influ­
ence systemic inflammation, blood coagulation, and lipid 
peroxidation that are the cardiovascular risk factors (Bar­
regard et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2021). Moreover, higher risk 
of hospital admission for cardiovascular disease has been 
associated with wildfire events where BOB-related PM2.5 
is largely generated (Requia et al. 2021). Finding of this 
study also reveals that BOB occurrence was associated 
with a sudden increase in OPD visits for respiratory disease 
and with a lagged increase in OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar disease. Support of this result comes from a prior study 
suggesting that people with chronic respiratory conditions 
is susceptible to the exacerbation by exposure to air pollu­
tion, leading to an increase of respiratory morbidity (Jiang 
et al. 2016). However, the onset of cardiovascular disease 
requires lagged time after exposure (Peters et al. 2001). In 
order to reduce the effect of BOB related air pollution, spe­
cific actions are therefore required to reduce exposure or to 
reduce the emission of air pollution from BOB.
We observed the significantly high heterogeneity among 
the province-specific estimates, showing that the associa­
tion between BOB related air pollutant and OPD visits for 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases highly varies among 
provinces. There is no clear evidence explaining the hetero­
geneity of the association between BOB related air pollutant 
and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that is similarly 
observed in this study, but this high heterogeneity might be 
partly explained by the variation in geographical locations, 
as well as demographical and socioeconomic characteristics 
(Jones et al. 2020; Karanasiou et al. 2021) that require fur­
ther investigations.
Longer exposure duration to BOB was significantly asso­
ciated with increased risk of OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory diseases. Specifically, exposure to BOB 
occurrence for two or more consecutive day was associated 
with 1.0272 (95% CI: 1.0104, 1.0442) and 1.0275 (95% 
CI: 1.0139, 1.0413) times higher risk of cardiovascular

inherently controls for day of the week, long-term trend and 
seasonality, and personal characteristics because each case 
was served as their own controls. Moreover, we compre­
hensively controlled for air pollution and meteorological 
variables that may influence the occurrence of BOB-related 
air pollution and number of OPD visits for cardiovascular 
and respiratory disease. Therefore, results of this study are 
reliable, to some extent.
5  Conclusions
Exposure to BOB occurrence was associated with an imme­
diate effect on respiratory OPD visits and a lagged effect 
on cardiovascular OPD visits. We also observed that longer 
exposure duration to BOB was significantly associated with 
higher risk of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases. However, we found that higher exposure intensity 
to BOB-related air pollution was associated with lower risk 
of OPD visits, although it is not statistically significant. 
Finding from this study can be used to improve or establish 
the warning systems to reduce cardiovascular and respira­
tory risk associated with exposure to BOB-related air pollu­
tion and longer exposure duration. Further study may also 
require quantifying the compositions of BOB-related air 
pollution so as to gain insight into understanding the toxico­
logical effects of BOB occurrence in Thailand.

as vehicle exhaust, particularly in the urban areas. This can 
lead to exposure misclassification. In addition, air pollution 
from BOB might be affected by burning events from sur­
rounding countries (transboundary haze), in which air pol­
lution from BOB might not be captured as no occurrence 
of fire hotspot in this study area was detected. However, 
we observed that concentration of PM10, one of the major 
air pollutants emitted from BOB (Chen et al. 2017; Junpen 
et al. 2018), in the day with BOB occurrence was signifi­
cantly higher than that in the day with non-BOB occurrence 
(p-value < 0.001) (Fig. S2). Hence, using fire hotspot data 
as a proxy for BOB occurrence in this study is reasonable, 
to some extent. Second, fire hotspot data was obtained from 
the satellite database, as well as air pollution and meteoro­
logical data was obtained from the air quality monitoring 
stations that is not well representing personal exposure. This 
could result in non-differential misclassification that biases 
the effect estimate towards the null hypothesis (Copeland et 
al. 1977). Therefore, findings from this study are unlikely 
due to false positive. Third, we did not quantify the concen­
tration of air pollution that is specifically emitted by BOB. 
Nevertheless, we characterized higher intensity of BOB 
according to fire hotspot occurrence and PM10 concentra­
tion that is well correlated (Fig. S2), indicating that higher 
PM10 concentration may be contributed from BOB occur­
rence. Moreover, we explored the effects of longer expo­
sure duration to BOB related air pollutant on OPD visits by 
defining two or more consecutive days of active fire hotspot 
occurrence as indicator for longer exposure duration. This 
result is only reflected that the effects of two or more con­
secutive days of exposure have the same effect on OPD vis­
its. Fourth, we did not take into account the effect of BOB 
occurrence on OPD visits in different population groups, 
such as age, sex, or other socioeconomic characteristics. 
Therefore, findings of this study could not determine which 
groups of population are more susceptible to the effects of 
BOB that may need to consider in the future study.
Several strengths of this study are also noted. First, it 
is the first multi-provinces study across Thailand deter­
mined the effect of BOB occurrence and health outcomes 
taken into account longer exposure duration and higher 
exposure intensity. Therefore, findings of this study could 
provide an insight into understanding the possible health 
effects of BOB occurrence over the whole Thailand. Sec­
ond, we estimated the association between BOB occurrence 
and OPD visits using both PM10 concentration data from 
air quality monitoring stations and fire hotspot data from 
satellite observations that might be more accurate reflecting

"India, a highly populated economy in transition generates huge quantity of municipal solid wastes and its management is 
posing great challenges. Infrastructural limitations force the urban local bodies to rely on traditional routes such as open 
dumpyards and landfills, where incidents of massive fire breakouts are often reported. In places where the collection system 
fails, the public seeks a much easier option of open burning of wastes in streets and households. The study reports a com-
parative assessment of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dl-PCBs emitted to air and residue during the repetitive incidents of massive fire 
breakouts at a municipal solid waste dumpyard and localized street waste burning in cities of India. The study also evaluated 
the direct exposure routes viz. inhalation as well as dermal and predicts the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks 
to the receiving population. The observed PCDD/F levels in the ambient air and burned residue samples ranged from 2.7 to 
41.4 pgTEQ/m3 and 79.8 to 860 ngTEQ/kg, while that of dl-PCB varied from 0.2 to 2.3 pgTEQ/m3 and 6.0 to 46.2 ngTEQ/
kg respectively. The dermal, as well as the inhalation daily exposure doses were estimated and the non-carcinogenic hazard 
indices of the children were found to be in levels of concern at two of the street burning sites while for adults the levels were 
found to be within the threshold limit. The cumulative Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) values ranged from 2 × ­10–6 
to 2 × ­10–4 suggesting moderate to low risk to cancer or cancer-linked illnesses to exposed individuals.

"Background: Exposure to particulate matter (PM) emitted from biomass burning is an increasing concern,
particularly in Southeast Asia. It is not yet clear how the source of PM influences the risk of an adverse health
outcome. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare health risks of PM from biomass burning and
non-biomass burning sources in northern Thailand.
Methods: We collected ambient air pollutant data (PM with a diameter of < 10 μm [PM10], PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide
[CO], Ozone [O3], and Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2]) from ground-based monitors and daily outpatient hospital visits in
Thailand during 2014–2017. Outpatient data included chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), ischaemic heart
disease (IHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD). We performed an ecological time series analysis to evaluate the
association between daily air pollutants and outpatient visits. We used the 90th and 95th percentiles of PM10
concentrations to determine days of exposure to PM predominantly from biomass burning.
Results: There was significant intra annual variation in PM10 levels, with the highest concentrations occurring
during March, coinciding with peak biomass burning. Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) between daily PM10 and
outpatient visits were elevated most on the same day as exposure for CLRD = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.012 to 1.028) and
CBVD = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.004 to 1.035), with no association with IHD = 0.994 (95% CI: 0.974 to 1.014). Adjusting for
CO tended to increase effect estimates. We did not find evidence of an exposure response relationship with levels
of PM10 on days of biomass burning.
Conclusions: We found same-day exposures of PM10 to be associated with certain respiratory and cardiovascular
outpatient visits. We advise implementing measures to reduce population exposures to PM wherever possible, and
to improve understanding of health effects associated with burning specific types of biomass in areas where such
large-scale activities occur.

"Open burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a poorly-characterized and frequently-underestimated
source of air pollution in developing countries. This paper estimates the quantity of MSW that was
burned in ﬁve erstwhile municipalities of the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. A household survey, a transect
walk survey, an experiment to measure the fraction of waste that is combustible, a survey on fraction
of population burning waste outside their houses, and a survey of the fraction of MSW burned at dump
sites were performed in this study, whereas burning/oxidation efﬁciency, municipal populations, MSW
generation rates, and emission factors were derived from the literature. The total mass of MSW burned
during 2016 is estimated to be 7400 tons (i.e., 20 tons/day), which was of 3% of the total MSW generated
in the valley municipalities that year. This exceeds Government estimates by a factor of three.
Multiplying the burned MSW mass by emission factors, the air pollutant emissions are estimated as
PM2.5 55 tons (OC 42 tons and EC 1.4 tons), PM10 60 tons, BC 25 tons, CO2 11,900 tons, CH4 30 tons,
SO2 5.0 tons, NOx 19.2 tons, CO 630 tons, NMVOC 112 tons, and NH3 5.7 tons per year. Open burning
of MSW can trigger health impacts such as acute and chronic respiratory disease, heart diseases, and
allergic hypersensitivity, in addition to impacts on local climate. Improved waste-segregation practices
at the source and waste-collection systems throughout the valley are needed to mitigate this pollution
source and its effects.

": Coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal made up of small particles, including heavy
metals and radioactive elements, is discarded in open-air landﬁlls where it can be emitted into the
air, contributing to air pollution in the surrounding community. Few regulations exist regarding
the storage, disposal, and transport of coal ash. There is limited research on the health impacts of
coal ash exposure on communities. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
respiratory symptoms among adults exposed to coal ash and non-exposed adults. A cross-sectional
epidemiological study was conducted among two populations: one exposed to coal ash and one not
exposed to coal ash. Perception of health (p-Value < 0.0001), cough (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =
5.30, 95% Conﬁdence Intervals (CI) = 2.60–11), shortness of breath (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.56–4.31),
hoarseness (AOR = 4.02, 95% CI = 2.45–6.60), respiratory infections (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.14–2.89),
and mean overall respiratory health score (p-Value < 0.0001) were all statistically signiﬁcantly greater
in exposed adults (N = 231) when compared to non-exposed adults (N = 170). Adults residing near
the coal ash facility were more likely to report respiratory symptoms than the non-exposed population.
More research on the health impact of coal ash and storage regulations needs to be conducted.
