Variations in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) due to agriculture crop residue burning (ACRB) on children
between the age group of 10 to 13 years and the young between 20 to 35 years are studied. The effects of
exposure to smoke due to rice–wheat crop residue burning on pulmonary functions like Force Vital Capacity
(FVC), Force Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) and Force Expiratory Flow
in 25 to 75% of FVC (FEF25–75%) on 40 healthy subjects of rural/agricultural area of Sidhuwal village of Patiala
City were investigated for a period from August 2008 to July 2009. Measurements were taken by spirometry
according to the American Thoracic Society standards. High volume sampler (HVS) and Anderson Impactor
were used to measure the concentration levels of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 in ambient air of the Sidhuwal village.
A signiﬁcant increase in the concentration levels of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 was observed due to which PFTs of
the subjects showed a signiﬁcant decrease in their values, more prominently in the case of children. PFTs of
young subjects recovered up to some extent after the completion of burning period but the PFT values of
children remained signiﬁcantly lower (pb0.001) even after the completion of burning episodes. Small size
particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) affected the PFTs to a large extent in comparison to the large size
particulate matter (SPM). The study indicates that ACRB is a serious environmental health hazard and
children are more sensitive to air pollution, as ACRB poses some unrecoverable inﬂuence on their PFTs.

1. Introduction
The health effects of agriculture crop residue burning (ACRB) on
the respiratory system of humans have been a matter of concern since
the past few decades in the developing countries as this is the most
cost effective way to dispose off the residue from the agriculture farms
(Cancado et al., 2006). It is a common practice in the northern regions
of India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab where, due to
modernization, large amounts of agricultural residues are produced
which are disposed off by burning in open ﬁelds (Mittal et al., 2009;
Sahai et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2010). This process continues for more
than one month depending upon the metrological conditions. During
the exhaustive period of ACRB due to less combustible conditions,
large amount of smoke is produced that is seen clearly in the form of
thick cloud over ﬁelds and the residential areas (Ezcurra et al., 2001).
Chemical agents that are released due to ACRB into the environment,
affect human health adversely, mainly respiratory system (Cancado
et al., 2006; Dennis et al., 2002; Lara et al., 2005; Long and Manfreda,
2006; Mohammad et al., 2002; Regalado et al., 2006). Since the
respiratory system is one major route whereby chemical and toxic
agents enter the body and cause disorders, and in severe cases may
lead to mortality (Donaldson and Macnee, 2003; Nicod, 1999; Olivieri
and Scoditti, 2005). The respiratory tract is their ﬁrst target, because it
comes into direct contact with the air and to protect the body itself it
mobilizes defense mechanisms. Due to increase in the concentration
of pollutants in the ambient air, oxidative stress and inﬂammation of
lung tissues occur that may affect the proper functioning of the lungs
(Brunkreef and Holgate, 2002; He et al., 1993; Olivieri and Scoditti,
2005; Macnee and Donaldson, 2003).
Several investigations on the respiratory status were done on the
basis of hospital admissions, survey and respiratory symptoms (Cao
et al., 2009; Cho et al., 2000; Jeffrey et al., 1997; Larrieu et al., 2007;
Regalado et al., 2006). Most of the investigations are reported which
take into account the ill-effects of pollution due to automobiles or
industrialization (Chan and Kwok, 2001; Cho et al., 2000; Hoek et al.,
2002; Roosbroeck et al., 2006) but effects of ACRB on health lag
behind these types of studies. ACRB is particularly dangerous since
most of the particulate are smaller than 10 microns (PM10) in size and
are easily able to penetrate deep into the lungs causing signiﬁcant
increase in the levels of respiratory and heart problems (American
Thoracic Society, 1996; Hauck et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005; Lee et al.,
2007; Macnee and Donaldson, 2003; Makkonen et al., 2010; Moris,
2001). Therefore, there is a need of systematic study to investigate the
ill-effects of agriculture crop residue burning on health. In the present

investigations, Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) of the healthy subjects
were done continually for 12 months and attempt are made to compare
the variations on PFTs of the young and children to see the effect of
ACRB.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study area
Study was conducted at Sidhuwal village of Patiala district of
Punjab. It is a rural/agricultural area located between 3021′ N and
7627′ E. Sidhuwal site is surrounded by agriculture land and has
minimal trafﬁc density. There is not even small industry within 10 km
radius and national highway is away by about 10 km circumference
from the selected position of the ambient air sampling. Location of
study was selected to cover maximum agricultural area around it so
that during ACRB, inﬂuence can be clearly checked. Rice and wheat are
the two major crops of this region with a combined cropping area of
more than 86%. The total biomass generated in Patiala from all sources
like agriculture crop residues, forest and other wastelands and agro-
industry is 3,792,252 MT/year. Out of total biomass generation in
Patiala, crop residue contributes 90.4% (TERI, 2003).
2.2. Subjects
Forty healthy subjects (male and female) having no lung disease
between age from 10 to 35 years with mean age of 17 year were
continually tested for a period of one year from August-2008 to July-
2009. Lung function capacity of human being generally increases from
birth up to the age of 20 years and after this it decreases slowly up to
40 but after the age of 40 years a sharp decrease is seen in their values
(Knudson et al., 1976, 1983). On the basis of these facts, total subjects
in the present study were divided under two categories; children (10
to 13 years) and young (20 to 35 years) and their demographic
characteristics at the start of the study are presented in Table 1. Before
including the subjects in the study, prior consent of the young and
children (from parents) were collected. Prior to testing all subjects
were questioned for their habits like smoking, health status, occupa-
tional and medical history. Children under observation were students
of sixth and seventh standards in a senior secondary school located in
the Sidhuwal village. All the subjects were non-smokers and none of
the subjects had any existing medical problem, respiratory illness or
symptoms and were of North Indian ethnicity.
2.3. Pulmonary Function Test
Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) like Force Vital Capacity (FVC),
Force Expiratory Volume in ﬁrst Second (FEV1), Peak Expiratory Flow
Rate (PEF) and Force Expiratory Flow in 25 to 75% (FEF25–75%) were
carried out by using portable Spirometer (Spirobank-G, IIa, MIR,
Roma, Italy). Spirometry of children was performed at their school
and remaining subjects in their homes during morning hours between
9 to 12 PM, according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS)
standards (Miller et al., 2005). Initially, each subject was instructed
and maneuver was demonstrated. Each subject was advised to take a
deep breath and then exhale in the sensor with force for as long as
possible and then inhale maximum volume of air. With each subject,
ﬁve to eight maneuvers were carried out in an attempt to achieve
three acceptable ﬂow-volume loops. From a minimum of three valid
maneuvers (difference between two value of FVC not more than
200 ml), Spirometer selected the best possible values of FVC, FEV1, PEF
and FEF25–75% based on the maximum value of FVC+FEV1. Respira-
tory parameters of subjects were measured in a room for at least two
times in a month by using individual mouthpieces. Data was recorded
after entering ethnicity, age, height, weight and gender of the
subjects, Spirometer predicts values according to the E.R.S.′93
Knudson (Knudson et al., 1983; Quanjer et al., 1993). To account the
variation due to age factor, data have been presented as percentage of
predicted value during different type of analysis. ATS Standards were
followed for the selection of subjects for the study, according to which
person whose FVC/FEV1 value is found to be greater than 75% comes
under the category of normal/healthy in terms of pulmonary diseases,
hence subjects whose FVC/FEV1 value were found to be greater than
80% were selected for the study.
2.4. Ambient Air Sampling
To access air pollution, SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 were monitored on
the roof of the same target secondary school by using high volume
sampler (HVS) and eight stages Anderson Impactor. Standardized
methods were used to measure the concentration of particulate
matter (IS: 5182 (Part XV), (1974)). To ensure the measurement
studies of pollutants reﬂected the pollutant exposure with higher
accuracy, the subjects were selected within 2 km of the air quality
monitoring site.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
For statistical analysis, Statistical Package for Social Sciences
(SPSS) (for windows, version 15) was used and standard methods
were applied. To analyze the difference for different parameters at
different time interval, Paired t-test was used. Method of linear
regression was applied to calculate the association between different
size particulate matters on PFTs. Origin 7.5 was used for plotting
different types of graphs. All statistical signiﬁcance tests were 2-tailed
and conﬁdence index was set at 95%. A level of p-value≤0.05 was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Descriptive statistics were
shown as mean and standard deviation. PFTs of a particular period
were calculated in two steps: (i) calculating average of different
values of one subject in respective month and (ii) taking mean of
average values of all subjects in respective periods.
3. Results and discussion
The Harmful effects of ACRB on PFTs of the healthy subjects have
been reported earlier (Agarwal et al., 2010). The effect of ACRB on
PFTs (FVC, FEV1, PEF and FEF25–75%) of children (10–13 years age) and
young (20–35 years) were reported here. For comparison between
two different age groups and to account for age factor, data for PFTs is
expressed as percentage of predicted value (% pred).
Monthly mean value of PFTs of children and young subjects from
August 2008 to July 2009 are shown in Fig. 1. For the category of
young subjects (Fig. 1A), the value of PFTs decreased in October and
November 2008. After November, PFTs show increase till March with
slight decrease in January 2009. Again sharp fall was observed in April
2009. Once again PFT value increase gradually up to July 2009.
In Children (Fig. 1B), the values of PFTs shows slight increase from
August to September followed by major decrease in October–
November 2008 which again increases in December 2008. After
December 2008, there is slight decrease in January–February 2009.

There is another sharp dip observed in the PFT values during April
2009. All the PFTs show similar trends i.e., signiﬁcant decrease in the
October–November and April–May during the rice and wheat crop
residue burning, but with different magnitude. Fig. 1(A and B) clearly
show that crop residue do have an appreciable effect on PFTs. Effect of
crop residue burning is precisely more prominent for children as their
lung function capacities suffers more permanent damage as the FVC of
98% in the month of August 2008 drops to 92% at the end of July 2009.
Fig. 2 represents the monthly average levels of SPM, PM10 and
PM2.5 at Sidhuwal village. SPM levels were minimum in August and
start increasing from September till November due to exhaustive
burning of rice crop residue. This increase in SPM level till November
was followed by decrease up to March as there was no burning
activity during this period. Again an abrupt rise in the concentration of
SPM level was observed in the April–May during the wheat crop
residue burning activity. PM10 and PM2.5 variations were found to be
almost same as that of SPM during the crop residue burning months
i.e., October–November and April–May.
Concentration of different size particulate matter were found to be
elevated during October–November and April–May in comparison to
pre and post crop residue burning months, which clearly indicates
that the crop residue burning had a prominent effect on the ambient
air quality (Fig. 2) as documented earlier (Mittal et al., 2009; Singh
et al., 2010). For better understanding the effects of crop residue
burning, results of 12 months were expressed into 6 periods on the
basis of burning time of rice and wheat crop residue; BRBP: before rice
crop residue burning period (August–September); DRBP: during rice
crop residue burning period (October–November); ARBP: after rice
crop residue burns (December–January); BWBP: before wheat crop
residue burning period (February–March); DWBP: during wheat crop

residue burning period (April–May); AWBP: after wheat crop residue
burns (June–July).
Table 2 shows the bimonthly mean value of PFTs like FVC, FEV1,
PEF, FEF25–75% and SpO2, and particulate matter like SPM, PM10 and
PM2.5 for each measured period. All pulmonary function indices were
lower DRBP and DWBP than those taken in other periods (BRBP, ARBP,
BWBP and AWBP). As expected, values of environmental parameters
like SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 are higher DRBP and DWBP than in other
periods. It is seen from Table 2 that concentration levels of almost all
parameters after increasing from before burning period of rice and
wheat to during rice and wheat burning period fall down after the
completion of exhaustive burning period. It was found from Table 2
that the momentous decreases in PFTs and increases in the con-
centration of different size particulate matter were seen during the
rice and wheat crop residue burning. During one third period of year
(April–May and October–November), concentration of particulate
matter remains higher than the prescribed safe limit of 200, 100 and
60 μgm−3 as per National ambient air quality standards for SPM, PM10,
PM2.5, respectively. Hence, common peoples are at higher risk during
this period. Variation in the level of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 support the
hypothesis that the changes in the PFTs are the result of variation in
levels of particulate matter in the ambient air.
In order to check whether the observed decreased values of PFTs
during rice and wheat crop residue burning episodes are signiﬁcant or
not, difference in PFTs between BWBP with other periods of children
and young age group were calculated by using paired T-test and
shown in Table 3. Signiﬁcant decrease was seen in all PFTs of young
and child age group during rice and wheat crop residue burning in
comparison to BRBP. For lower age group (children), difference for
FVC value found signiﬁcantly lower during the burning periods.
Difference was observed as 8.272 and 8.658 (pb0.001) for DRBP and
DWBP, respectively. These values recovered up to some extent during
the non-burning periods but were signiﬁcantly lower (3.666, 7.298,
and 5.737) for ARBP, BWBP and AWBP. Trends in other PFTs were
almost same as that of FVC in children.
In case of young age group, value of PFTs were signiﬁcantly
lowered in DRBP, but only FVC and FEV1 values were found to be
signiﬁcant low in ARBP (4.105, 5.334, pb0.001) where as in BWBP
non-signiﬁcant ( pN0.05) change were seen in all PFTs with a positive
value observed in case of FEV1. All the PFTs show signiﬁcant difference
DWBP. Differences (BRBP−AWBP) were found to be non-signiﬁcant
negative in all PFTs except FEF25–75% in which non-signiﬁcant positive
difference were found. Negative values in the difference of BRBP with
BWBP and AWBP of some pulmonary functions in case of young
subjects indicate that there is recovery in their PFTs indices. Whereas,
for lower age group, difference between BRBP and AWBP were found
to be signiﬁcant positive ( pb0.001) in all PFTs which shows that due
to ACRB, PFTs did not recover completely even after the completion of
burning episode and caused some permanent affect in the children .
Results (Table 3) illustrate that PFTs of children have large and
unrecoverable decrease in their PFTs which give evidence that
increase in the pollution level during ACRB; children have more ill-
effect on their respiratory system in comparison to young subjects.
The airways epithelium of growing children is more permeable to air
pollutants and lung defenses against particulate and gaseous pollution
are not fully evolved. Children also have a differential ability to
metabolize, detoxify and excrete environmental agents (Schwartz,
2004), and perform a greater level of physical activity than young;
hence, their intake of air into the lungs is much greater than that of
young subjects (Stanojevic et al., 2008; Ulrik and Backer, 1999).
Children spend more time outside the home, particularly in the late
afternoon, which signiﬁcantly increases their exposure and intake of
ambient air, compared to the young. Children have higher resting
metabolic rate of oxygen consumption per unit body weight than the
young because they have large surface per unit body weight and
because they are growing rapidly. An additional consideration is the
smaller lung surface area/kg of body mass in the early stages of
development. Thus, higher amounts of inspired air will affect a
relatively smaller area of lungs tissue. On the basis of body weight, the
volume of air passing through the lungs of a child is more than that of
young under the same conditions and more atmospheric pollutant
could reach the lung of child. Moreover, children have narrower
airways, thus irritation caused by air pollution would produce only
slight response in young which can result potentially signiﬁcant
obstruction in the airway of child (Moya et al., 2004; Staurt, 1984).
Among children and young, children are more susceptible to the
harmful effects of air pollution; this may be the possible reason that
PFTs of children were affected more in comparison to young.
Signiﬁcant negative correlation is found between different size
particulate matter and PFTs. To ﬁnd which size particulate matters
have more effect on PFTs, association between different sized par-
ticulate matter and PFTs were calculated. The relationship between
the monthly average concentration of different size particulate matter
and monthly average PFTs value of 40 subjects was developed using
linear regression and considering PFTs as dependent and particulate
matter as independent variables, respectively.
Table 4 shows the change in the PFTs with respect to the 10 μgm−3
increment of each type of particulate matter. The increase in the
concentration of SPM, PM10 and PM2.5 by 10 μgm−3 was signiﬁcantly
related (pb0.05) to all PFTs, except for SPM with FEF25–75%. Negative
value of change shows that with the increase in the concentration of
particulate matter, there is a signiﬁcant decrease in the value of all
PFTs. A close look on the decrease in the values of PFTs resulting from
increase in pollutant levels (SPM, PM10 and PM2.5) indicates that

decrease in PFT values is in the order PM2.5NPM10NSPM. Results show
that effect of small size particulate matter is found to be higher as
compared to larger size particulate matter. The nasal turbulence
mechanism for removing particles from air is so effective that almost
no particle larger than 10 μm in diameter enters the lung through the
nose but respiratory ﬁltration system could not entrap particular
matter with size less than 2.5 μm which pass the respiratory ﬁltration
system and enter the alveoli, diffuse through the walls of the alveoli
and adhere to alveolar ﬂuid. Due to this, available surface area for gas
exchange mechanism gets affected and hence PFTs show signiﬁcant
decrease in their values with the increase of small size particulate
matter i.e., PM2.5.
One possible factor for decrease in PFTs could be quality of lung
function maneuvers that might have decreased over time because of
decreased efforts of the subjects. If decreasing efforts was the only
reason for the decline in the value of PFTs, then the values should have
continued to decline after the completion of burning of wheat and rice
residue; however, results showed that after the completion of
exhaustive burning period i.e. in December and June the value of
PFTs increased. Variation of PFTs over time was not inﬂuenced by the
technical effects (e.g. possible irregularity in taking sample), because
necessary care like minimum of three acceptable maneuvers with less
then 5% difference between consecutive maneuvers were done during
the whole study period of the measurement.
There are several limitations in this study including the lack of
personal exposure data, small number of subjects and the possibility of
other air pollutants effect. Since signiﬁcant decrease in the value of PFTs
were seen two times in the study, ﬁrst in the period of rice crop residue
burning and second time during the wheat crop residue burning, which
illustrate that ACRB induced negative effect on the PFTs of healthy
inhabitants. Moreover, large signiﬁcance level (p b0.001) for the mean
difference in the PFT values of subjects before and after the burning
period of rice and wheat residue burning increase the reliability of the
results. Current study is in good agreements with other studies, in which
increase in pollution due different reasons affect the health status
(hospital admission or respiratory symptoms or mortality and morbid-
ity rate) (Cao et al., 2009; Hoek et al., 2002; Jeffrey et al., 1997; Moris,
2001; Ostro, 1984; Schwartz et al., 1996; Schwartz, 2004).
4. Conclusion
Open burning of agriculture crop residue is episodic but still a
serious issue for both health and environment perspectives. Present
study reveals that due to ACRB there is a signiﬁcant increase in the
concentration of particulate matter, which had a negative effect on the
PFTs of the healthy subjects with higher contribution of PM2.5 and
PM10. Increase in pollution level due to ACRB posed more and
unrecoverable decrease in PFTs of the children as compared to young
age group. Study showed that children are at higher risk due to ACRB
and possess some permanent decrease in their PFTs by the increase in
pollution level. In the initial stage of life, if any permanent effects are
added, proper development of lung function would be affected which
in due course of time may lead to lowering the respiring capacity of
the adult and cause a major epidemiological hazard. Thus, ACRB is
really big and serious health issue on which necessary steps must be
taken and if this is not controlled at present it will become a more
serious health issue in coming years, because with time new
technique and machinery would be used for harvesting that might
produce more residues on ﬁelds. Therefore, health research strategies
should focus on how to control this open crop residue burning.

The study deals with the assessment of health impact and the respective economic cost attributed to particulate
matter (PM) emitted into the atmosphere from biomass burning for space heating, focusing on the differences
between the warm and cold seasons in 2011–2012 and 2012–2013 in Thessaloniki (Greece). Health impact
was assessed based on estimated exposure levels and the use of established WHO concentration–response func-
tions (CRFs) for all-cause mortality, infant mortality, new chronic bronchitis cases, respiratory and cardiac hospi-
tal admissions. Monetary cost was based on the valuation of the willingness-to-pay/accept (WTP/WTA), to avoid
or compensate for the loss of welfare associated with illness.
Results showed that long term mortality during the 2012–2013 winter increased by 200 excess deaths in a city of
almost 900,000 inhabitants or 3540 years of life lost, corresponding to an economic cost of almost 200–250m€.
New chronic bronchitis cases dominate morbidity estimates (490 additional new cases corresponding to a mon-
etary cost of 30m€). Estimated health and monetary impacts are more severe during the cold season, despite its
smaller duration (4 months). Considering that the increased ambient air concentrations (and the integral of out-
door/indoor exposure) are explained by shifting from oil to biomass for domestic heating purposes, several alter-
native scenarios were evaluated. Policy scenario analysis revealed that signiﬁcant public health and monetary
beneﬁts (up to 2b€ in avoided mortality and 130m€ in avoided illness) might be obtained by limiting the biomass
share in the domestic heat energy mix. Fiscal policy affecting fuels/technologies used for domestic heating needs
to be reconsidered urgently, since the net tax loss from avoided oil taxation due to reduced consumption was fur-
ther compounded by the public health cost of increased mid-term morbidity and mortality.

1. Introduction
Indoor biomass burning for residential heating is a major source of
indoor and outdoor air quality degradation. One of the major compo-
nents of biomass burning is emitted PM. The association of biomass
burning PM with potential health effects, as well as their toxicity poten-
cy in comparison to other PM combustion sources have been
investigated through a controlled study of human exposure to wood
smoke, epidemiological studies (observational or interventional), as
well as with toxicological tests — a very comprehensive review on
both perspectives was carried out by Naeher et al. (2007).
To date, solely a single controlled study of human exposure to wood
smoke has been published (Barregard et al., 2006). Inﬂammatory medi-
ators and coagulation factor levels of the exposed subjects were altered
and free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation increased after wood
smoke exposure. Although this is the only controlled study of wood
smoke exposure published to date including a small number of subjects
(13), it is suggestive of wood smoke-associated systemic inﬂammatory
effects.

The majority of information regarding direct human health effects
associated with wood smoke exposure is derived from a relatively
large number of epidemiologic studies that have documented respirato-
ry effects of residential wood burning, especially in children (Naeher
et al., 2007). One of the earliest studies was conducted in Michigan by
Honicky et al. (1985) who compared respiratory symptoms in 31 chil-
dren who lived in homes with wood stoves with an equal number of
children who lived in homes without wood stoves. Exposure to smoke
from wood stoves resulted in exacerbation of severe symptoms of respi-
ratory diseases. Related health effects research in Seattle shows associ-
ations between PM2.5 exposure and lung function decrements in
children (Koenig et al., 1993), visits to the emergency departments for
asthma (Norris et al., 1999), hospitalizations for asthma (Sheppard
et al., 1999), and increases in asthma symptoms in children (Yu et al.,
2000), as well as increases in exhaled nitric oxide (Koenig et al.,
2005). Considering that wood burning is one of the major sources of ex-
posure to ﬁne PM in the Seattle area, the related studies resulted in sig-
niﬁcant associations between wood burning PM and adverse health
outcomes. Another study examined the relationship of woodstoves to
otitis media and asthma in a case–control study of home environmental
air pollutants in Springville, NY (Daigler et al., 1991). Use of biomass
burning sources resulted in increased incidence rate of several adverse
health effects such as otitis media and severe shortness of breath.
Thus, indoor biomass burning was identiﬁed as the second most impor-
tant source of exposure to ﬁne PM after environmental tobacco smoke
(Ostro et al., 1991).
In the study of Happo et al. (2013) health-related toxicological prop-
erties of PM1 emissions from ﬁve modern and two old technology appli-
ances were examined. Mice were intratracheally exposed to a wide
range of particulate samples and then bronchoalveolar lavage ﬂuid
(BALF) was assayed for indicators of inﬂammation, cytotoxicity and
genotoxicity. The results indicated that although older technologies
emit higher amounts of PM1 per energy unit produced, PM1 emitted
from modern appliances induced higher inﬂammatory potential, prob-
ably due to ash-related compounds.
A recent meta-analysis by Diette et al. (2012) concluded that inhala-
tion of wood smoke at a relatively low level, had the potential to sup-
press the immunity of the respiratory system, resulting in increased
susceptibility to infections as well as to several types of lung disease.
To date, only a limited number of studies have evaluated the results
of shifting between biomass and conventional fuel for domestic heating
(intervention studies). The most comprehensive study up to now is an
intervention study in Australia carried out by Johnston et al. (2013)
who evaluated the effect of community education campaigns, enforce-
ment of environmental regulations, and a wood heater replacement
program on daily mortality. This bundle of actions resulted in a 17 μg/
m3 reduction of ambient air PM10 in the wintertime, which, was
reﬂected, in turn, in reduced annual cardiovascular and respiratory
mortality, especially for males.
In their study in Austria Haluza et al. (2012) estimated that replace-
ment of light oil by biomass as well as fossil gas would result in in-
creased mortality and morbidity due to the related hike in PM
ambient air levels. The higher the biomass energy share, the higher
the PM attributed mortality and morbidity. Although interesting from
the perspective of scenario analysis, the use of PM10 as input in concen-
tration–response functions, does not seem to fully capture the variabil-
ity on PM concentrations related to biomass burning. Thus inter-
scenario differences might well be underestimated.
Despite the uncertainties related to monetization of air pollution re-
lated impacts, signiﬁcant efforts have been made based on the Value-
per-Statistical-Life (VSL) concept. Alberini et al. (2006) concluded that
VSL is not signiﬁcantly lower for older persons, but income was posi-
tively associated with willingness to pay (WTP). Roman et al. (2012)
elucidated the uncertainties related to VSL for a reduction in mortality
risks, while Ortiz et al. (2011) identiﬁed altruism towards children,
and a strong income effect on WTP to avoid the loss of welfare
associated with illness. In the recent years, scientiﬁc interest has shifted
towards the assessment of climate change impact health costs. The re-
spective cost is in the range of 100 billion euros annually in the EU-27
region (Watkiss and Hunt, 2012). Finally, the study carried out by
Desaigues et al. (2011), aimed at the economic valuation of air pollution
mortality. Based on a 1493 person survey carried out in 9 EU countries,
the monetary value of a life year (VOLY) was estimated to be equal to
25,000 euro.
Over the last couple of years, the use of biomass as heating source
was allowed in Greece as a CO2-neutral means of space heating in the
large metropolitan areas of Athens and Thessaloniki affecting more
than half of the country's population. At the same time the use of light
heating diesel was heavily taxed apparently to combat illegal trafﬁcking
of heating diesel. In the same period Greece faced a ﬁnancial crisis with
signiﬁcant repercussions on the average household income. That com-
bination of parameters resulted in increased use of biomass for residen-
tial heating in year 2012, followed by a signiﬁcant increase of ambient
air, indoor air and exposure to PM10 and PM2.5. In this study, we aim
to quantify the health and socioeconomic effects related to that shift
from light heating diesel to biomass burning, as well as to evaluate alter-
native scenarios of residential heating energy share.
2. Methodology
2.1. Exposure assessment
To better reﬂect the effect of biomass burning on public health, actual
population exposure was estimated. Thus, indoor concentrations taking
into account outdoor penetration as well as indoor sources (biomass
burning among them) were estimated. The estimation was based on a
mass balance model, that takes into account the major processes
governing particle concentration i.e., emissions, deposition, indoor/out-
door exchange rate, and outdoor inﬁltration. A detailed description of
the indoor air model and the related parameterization has been given
by Sarigiannis et al. (2014) on the model and the related parameteriza-
tion. In summary, the mass balance is described by the following formula:
V  dCind
dt
¼ Q  inf  Cout−Cind
ð
Þ þ E−kdep  Cind  V
where:
E
the strength of the emission sources (mass / time)
V
the volumes of the indoor location
Cout
the outdoor concentration
Cind
the indoor concentration of the indoor location
Q
the indoor–outdoor air exchange rate
inf
the inﬁltration fraction
kdep
the deposition rate
Particle penetration into buildings from the ambient air depends on
pollutant species, geometry, surface materials and pressure drop across
the leakage path. It is usually expressed by means of a dimensionless
penetration factor; typical values of the latter for domestic environ-
ments were taken from the PTEAM study (Özkaynak et al., 1996).
These values are normally distributed with a mean value of 1 and a stan-
dard deviation of 0.06. Background emission rates for PM10 and PM2.5
were taken equal to 5600 and 1400 μg/h respectively (not including in-
door smoking or long-term burning activities). These values are consid-
ered to be representative of Greece (Hänninen et al., 2004). Biomass
burning emissions into the indoor environment from open ﬁreplaces
and other biomass combustion sources (e.g., stoves) were estimated ex-
perimentally in our study, found to be equal to 2300 μg/h. Deposition of
atmospheric aerosol particles on indoor surfaces (the ﬂoor, walls, ceiling
and furniture) takes place via electrostatic and thermostatic processes,
and it is signiﬁcantly affected by the type of air mixing (turbulent vs.

laminar ﬂow). The distribution for this variable was taken from the
PTEAM study (Özkaynak et al., 1996) and the respective values for
PM10 and PM2.5 were 0.67 and 0.39 h−1 respectively. Finally, a typical
residence volume equal to 245 m3 was considered as representative
(UNECE, 2006).
2.1.1. Personal exposure
Personal exposure is the average concentration of PMx to which an
individual is exposed to over a given period of time. If over time T the in-
dividual goes through n locations, spending a fraction fn of time in loca-
tion n where the concentration of the pollutant under consideration is
Cn, then the personal exposure for this period T, represented by the con-
centration ET, is given by (Ott, 1982):

Micro-environments were differentiated in terms of time spent
within them. Time-weighted factors were used, based on the time–ac-
tivity data from the EXPOLIS study enriched with data from the
MTUS1 database. Exposure factors used were cross-checked against
the European Commission's EXPOFACTS database.2 Thus, to estimate
exposure, we used information on actual detailed time activity patterns,
linking several types of activities and their respective duration to specif-
ic indoor micro-environments. By using detailed activity patterns and
linking them to speciﬁc micro-environments an additional factor
inﬂuencing the actual human intake of PMx, namely inhalation rate,
was accounted for. Different types of activities demand different levels
of effort that correspond to different inhalation rates. A detailed descrip-
tion of activity-dependent inhalation rates is given in Sarigiannis et al.
(2012). For this purpose, based on the time weighed contribution of in-
dividual activities, their intensity and the corresponding inhalation rate,
we derived adjustment factors for each location and activity type. As a
result, PMx intake was given by the following formula:
E ¼
X
n
f loc  Cloc  inhact
where inhact is the inhalation adjustment factor for each type of micro-
environment and activity encountered in the calculations.
2.2. Health impact assessment
To estimate the health effects of PM exposure, we used well
established epidemiological concentration–response functions for out-
door PM (WHO, 2005). Differences in toxicity depending on particle
composition (e.g., concentration and types of PAHs adsorbed) were
not taken into account, since the current level of epidemiological knowl-
edge does not allow the use of different concentration–response
functions based on the differences in composition, an opinion which is
also supported by WHO (2007). Different concentration–response
functions might be used only for particles of different aerodynamic
diameters (PM10 and PM2.5). Other authors have come to similar con-
clusions. According to Boman et al. (2006), biomass burning related
health outcomes were similar to the ones observed from acute effects
of exposure to PM from different sources (Boman et al., 2003),
concluding that there is no reason to consider biomass burning PMs
less toxic. Moreover, a limited number of studies provided evidence
on the impact of biomass smoke exposure on lung cancer (Behera and
Balamugesh, 2005; Hernández-Garduño et al., 2004). Similarly, there
is relative paucity of established cohort results on outcomes such as
asthma and cardiovascular disease related to PM that originated from
indoor biomass use. This is in contrast to other PM sources that have
been extensively evaluated with regard to their effects on human
health, such as sidestream smoke.
Based on an extensive review of studies investigating the toxicity of
PM, Naeher et al. (2007) concluded that the scientiﬁc evidence from the
studies existing so far is sufﬁcient enough to justify that PM emitted
from biomass combustion is no less toxic than PM emitted from other
sources. A recent study from our group (Sarigiannis et al., 2015) deter-
mined age-differentiated lung cancer risk from PAHs adsorbed onto
particulate matter emitted from biomass burning. When differences in
respiratory tract physiology in different age groups and lung deposition
dynamics of different PMx size fractions are taken into account a signif-
icant variation in exposure to PAHs is observed, resulting in similarly
varying lung cancer risks. Based on the difference of the size fraction be-
tween particles emitted from biomass burning and the ones emitted
from trafﬁc and industrial sources, the estimated lung cancer risk from
biomass-derived particles may be higher than the risk from other
types of atmospheric particulate matter.
Among the currently regulated pollutants in wood smoke, ﬁne par-
ticles (PM2.5) serve as the best exposure metric in most circumstances
(Sarigiannis et al., 2014). In addition, PM2.5 tends to be among the most
elevated in relation to existing air quality standards. The concentration–
response functions used in this study are given in Table 1. For endpoints
where original PM2.5 functions are not available, the respective PM10
CRF estimates were converted to estimates of PM2.5 by multiplying
the PM10 CRFs by a conversion factor obtained from the con-current
measurements of PM10 and PM2.5 in the Apheis-3 study (APHEIS,
2004). Apheis-3 measured PM10 and PM2.5 in 26 cities — 11 of the cit-
ies had simultaneous PM10 and PM2.5 measurements. On average, the
ratio of mass concentration of PM2.5 to PM10 was about 0.65 and
ranged from 0.5 in Gothenburg, Sweden to 0.71 in Rouen, France. The
PM2.5/PM10 ratio was used as the conversion factor between PM2.5
and PM10.
As the relationship between PM measurements and health effects is
log-linear, the conversion from PM10 CRFs to PM2.5 CRFs followed the
mathematical formula below:

The detailed analysis for the extrapolation of PM10 concentration–
response functions is given in the ﬁnal deliverable of the HEIMTSA pro-
ject case studies report (IOM, 2011), based on the initial concept de-
scribed by WHO (WHO, 2004d). Brieﬂy, the epidemiological studies
from where the CRFs for the endpoints of interest were retrieved are
given below:
Infant mortality: Quantiﬁcation of PM10 effects on infant mortality
followed the CAFE study (Hurley et al., 2005), which was based on a
cohort of four million infants (Woodruff et al., 1997). Post-neonatal in-
fant mortality is considered as death between the ages of one month
and one year. The associations reported between infant mortality
(all-cause) and PM10 produced a CRF (relative risk) of: 4% (95% CI:
2%, 7%) for increase in infant mortality per 10 μg/m3 PM10.
Chronic bronchitis (adults): Schindler et al. (2009) reported on the
relationship between chronic bronchitis in the SAPALDIA cohort
and PM10. Their study comprised 7019 participants who had com-
pleted the follow-up questionnaire, lived at the same address for at
least one year before baseline and had sufﬁciently complete core
data. Chronic bronchitis here is deﬁned as chronic cough and/or
chronic phlegm, which persisted for at least 3 months per year
for the last 2 years. By processing the data in the CAFE study
(Hurley et al., 2005), an impact function for new cases of chronic
bronchitis was derived, estimating a 22% (95% CI: 2%, 38%) increase
per 10 μg/m3 PM10. Under the coordination of WHO existing data

were re-analyzed in the frame of the Health Risks of Air Pollution in
Europe (HRAPIE) project (WHO, 2013). Based on the recently pub-
lished systematic review of studies on the relationship of COPD to
air pollution (Schikowski et al., 2014), the HRAPIE team produced
revised estimates, which brought the CRF to an 11.7% (95% CI: 4%,
18.9%) change per 10 μg/m3 of PM10.
Chronic bronchitis (children): The WHO (2013) evaluated the re-
sults of the PATY study (Hoek et al., 2012), which analyzed data col-
lected by cross-sectional studies previously conducted in 11
countries. A borderline signiﬁcant association of bronchitis preva-
lence with long-term average PM10 concentration in cities was re-
ported with a RR of 8% (95% CI −2%, 19%) per 10 μg/m3 annual
mean PM10.
Cardiac hospital admissions: According to a WHO meta-analysis of
PM10 and cardiovascular hospital admissions, there is stronger evi-
dence that daily variations in PM are related to cardiac hospital ad-
missions (i.e., those affecting arteries near the heart itself) than to
cerebrovascular admissions (stroke, etc.) or to cardiovascular ad-
missions in general (WHO, 2004b,c). Based on this conclusion, the
effects of PM10 on cardiac hospital admission (ICD 9 codes 390–
4292) have been quantiﬁed. The Apheis-3 report includes a CRF
linking PM10 and cardiac hospital admissions based on data from
the APHEA-2 study of eight European cities (Barcelona, Birmingham,
London, Milan, Paris, Rome, Stockholm and the Netherlands, consid-
ered as one large urban area) (Le Tertre et al., 2002). The derived CRF
for cardiac admissions (relative risk) for all ages was a 0.6% (95% CI:
0.3, 0.9%) change in cardiac hospital admissions per 10 μg/m3 PM10.
Respiratory hospital admissions: The WHO meta-analysis of hos-
pital admissions and PM10 provides European risk estimates for
different age groups (WHO, 2004c). For adults aged 65 and
older, studies in eight cities, six of them from the APHEA 2
study, were included in the meta-analysis producing a CRF of
0.7% (95% CI: 0.2%, 1.3%) per 10 μg/m3 PM10 in adults aged 65
and older. For people aged 0–64, information on daily variations in
PM10 and respiratory hospital admissions was only found for
three European cities — two in England and one in Rome (WHO,
2004b,c). The three studies reported rates separately for the 0–14
and 15–64 age groups. The results for the two age groups were sim-
ilar and the overall 0–64 CRF is roughly 1% (95% CI: 0%, 2%) per 10 μg/
m3 PM10 in people aged 0–64. Previously published systematic re-
views and meta-analyses from Europe as well as North America
were incorporated in the meta-analysis ensuring that the most up-
to-date estimates were included in the overall risk estimate. Eleven
risk estimates were included producing a CRF (relative risk) for
respiratory hospital admissions of 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7, 1%) change in
respiratory hospital admissions per 10 μg/m3 PM10.
Mortality: For quantiﬁcation in Europe the CAFE cost–beneﬁt analysis
(CAFE CBA) used a relative risk (RR) estimate of 1.06 for all-cause
mortality hazards (95% CI 1.02–1.11) per 10 pg/m3 PM2.5. This esti-
mate was taken from analyses of American Cancer Society (ACS)
data by Pope et al. (2002), and was based on a recommendation by
the Task Force on Health (UNECE/WHO, 2004; WHO, 2006;
UNECE/WHO, 2004). It reﬂects an effect of exposures averaged over
the 16+ years of mortality follow-up. The relative risk estimate
used in CAFE is different from the corresponding RR estimate of 1.04
(95% CI 1.01–1.08), in all-cause mortality hazards, used by the WHO
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project (WHO, 2004a) for quantiﬁca-
tion of mortality effects worldwide. That lower estimate was also
taken from Pope et al. (2002); it expresses the effect of exposure as
measured close to the start of the follow-up period. The experts
team participating in the HRAPIE study under the coordination of
WHO (2013) re-analyzed all cohort studies published before January
2013 (Hoek et al., 2013). Thirteen different studies conducted in the
adult populations of North America and Europe contributed to revis-
ing the respective estimates, which bring the CRF to 1.062 (95% CI
1.040, 1.083) per 10 μg/m3.
Relative risk was calculated for the average concentration X, using
the following for PM2.5:
RR ¼ CRF
X
10
ð Þ:
The exponential is used because the original analyses used a propor-
tional hazard, i.e., log-linear, regression model. From this relative risk
was derived the attributable fraction AF which was derived as follows:

and this was multiplied by the background rate of disease BR to derive
the estimated health impact HI as the number of cases expected to rep-
resent the respective adverse health outcome in the population of inter-
est P. Thus, the health impact HI is given as:
HI ¼ AF  BR  F:
The actual burden of mortality (i.e., the attributable death due to
PM2.5 exposure) was expressed in years of life lost (YLL). To estimate
YLL, life tables (WHO, 2014b) were employed, where national popula-
tion and the corresponding mortality data per age band are used.
These data are used to derive the population-weighed annual average

EUROSTAT databases (EUROSTAT, 2011). Additional data for back-
ground rate of disease and mortality were obtained by WHO (2008).
The CRFs used for the selected health endpoints are given in detail in
Table 1.
2.3. Monetary cost
The starting point for the valuation of health end-points is the iden-
tiﬁcation of the components that comprise changes in welfare. These
components should be added to reckon the total welfare change,
assuming no overlap between impact categories to avoid double-
counting:
– Resource costs i.e., medical costs paid by the health service or cov-
ered by insurance, and any other personal out-of-pocket expenses
made by the individual (or family).
– Opportunity costs i.e., the cost in terms of lost productivity (work
time loss or performing at less than full capacity) and the opportuni-
ty cost of leisure (leisure time loss) including unpaid work.
– Dis-utility i.e., other social and economic costs including any restric-
tions on or reduced enjoyment of desired leisure activities, discom-
fort or inconvenience (pain or suffering), anxiety about the future,
and concern and inconvenience to family members and others.
The welfare changes represented by components (i) and (ii) can be
approximated using existing market prices for these. This measure
needs to be added to a measure of the affected individual's loss of utility,
as the latter is reﬂected in a valuation of the willingness-to-pay/accept
(WTP/WTA), to avoid/compensate for the loss of welfare associated
with the illness. For the endpoints considered in this paper, Table 2 pre-
sents a summary of the unit values derived in the course of the HEIMTSA
project (UBath, 2011). These values are the result of both an evaluation
of the evidence available in the existing literature and ad hoc population
surveys in several European countries.
For each health endpoint unit values are identiﬁed on the basis of an
informal meta-analysis of the evidence, which accounted for the distri-
bution of available values and an assessment of the quality and
geographical focus of each study, incorporating thus considerable un-
certainty in health valuation. Uncertainty derives from a combination
of (a) paucity of the evidence base, (b) difﬁculty that people have
with identifying their preferences for (avoidance of) health conditions,
and (c) lack of maturity in the study methods themselves. Nonetheless,
in the view of the wealth of data upon which they are based, the unit
values given in Table 2 are robust estimates of both the central estimate
and the upper and lower bounds of monetary valuation for each of the
health endpoints considered in our study.
Mortality costs of air pollution were also estimated based on
change of life expectancy (LE), using the value of a life year (VOLY)
as monetary valuation metric. According to the VOLY methodology
air pollution premature mortality results in shorter LE loss per
death compared to other causes of mortality such as fatal accidents
(resulting in 30–40 years of LE loss), upon which VSL estimates are
based (Desaigues et al., 2011).
2.4. Scenario analysis
The results of the 2012–2013 measurements were compared to the
ones made in 2011–2012 to understand better the effect that different
policy measures regulating the market price of heating fuel in tandem
with the incumbent economic crisis in Greece and other countries in
the European South may have on non-occupational exposure of the
urban population to particulate matter and the associated health and
monetary impact. Own-price elasticity of light heating oil was taken as
eloil = −0.39 (IOBE, 2013). A ﬁeld survey encompassing ca. 300 house-
holds across the greater area of Thessaloniki implemented using the on-
line SurveyMonkey tool provided consumer behavior information that
was used to generate the cross-fuel elasticity table below (Table 3).
The scenarios are based on reasonable assumptions and existing
trends related to the energy market share of different fuels and heating
systems (e.g., the market share of natural gas use for space heating had
been increasing over the last years but it is currently stabilized to
around 40%). However the interplay of multiple factors such as ﬁnancial
pressures or incentives might result in unexpected ﬁgures (as occurred
with the increased biomass use), favoring one technological solution for
space heating over another. Through analysis of speciﬁc scenarios we
highlighted the attributable differences in public health burden, should
speciﬁc space heating practices be adopted. The different policy scenar-
ios examined (and the corresponding average urban background con-
centrations) are presented in Table 4.
Differences in the urban background concentration, which in turn
were reﬂected in population exposure to PM for the intervention sce-
narios examined herein, were estimated based on a data assimilation al-
gorithm coupling: (a) a regulatory atmospheric dispersion model
(CALPUFF) (Scire et al., 2000a, 2000b) following a Lagrangian Gaussian
formulation applied on area sources that was supported by a reﬁned
and up-to-date emissions inventory at high spatial resolution; (b) the
OSPM model (Berkowicz et al., 2008) for capturing trafﬁc-related emis-
sions taking into account street canyons; and (c) spatially distributed

measurements of PMx concentrations using ground monitors across the
Thessaloniki metropolitan area. The computed annual average concen-
trations at the receptor points for the OSPM and the CALPUFF models to-
gether with the observations from air pollution monitoring stations
across the greater area of Thessaloniki are used as input to a spatial in-
terpolation model employing ordinary kriging. The relative weight of
the pollution estimates from the atmospheric models and ground mon-
itors are optimized to reduce the residual error based on an advanced
Kalman ﬁlter formulation.
The following ﬁgure shows the resulting PM2.5 map of the metro-
politan area of Thessaloniki in 2011 (Fig. 1).
In order to simplify the estimation of the effect that different space
heating fuels and technological options have on the atmospheric burden
with particulate matter in Thessaloniki an empirical model was built,
correlating the 2011–2013 ambient air concentration data, the distribu-
tion of fuel/technology used for these years and the respective PM emis-
sion factors. The latter are equal to 0.36, 2.16 and 160 mg PM2.5/MJ for
natural gas (boilers), oil (boilers) and biomass burning (open and closed
ﬁreplaces, wood stoves, pellet and wood log boilers) as derived from both
an extensive literature review and experimental work regarding boiler
emission efﬁciencies for different types of fuel (Nussbaumer et al.,
2008). The emission factor for the biomass burning systems is a weighted
average of the emission factors of each of the biomass combustion tech-
nologies considered weighed by the respective relative market shares
(see Table 5). The latter were derived through the ﬁeld survey described
above.
The following regression model for the interpolation of projected
ambient air PM concentrations during the cold period of a given year
was derived based on the emission factors and the comparison of the
concentration data between 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 cold and
warm period data:
Ccold ¼ Cwarm þ a  f oil  Eoil þ b  f ng  Eng þ c  f bio  Ebio
where Cwarm is the urban background concentration in the warm period
of the same year, foil, fng and fbio are the residential heating technological
energy share for light heating oil, natural gas and biomass respectively
and a, b, c are the regression coefﬁcients (respectively equal to 0.95.
0.97 and 2) that best ﬁt the results for the average winter urban back-
ground levels in the Thessaloniki area. Additional parameters that
might affect the model were statistically insigniﬁcant, since the meteo-
rological conditions between the two years did not differ substantially
and long-range particulate pollution transport did not show signiﬁcant
variation for the duration of the study. During the cold period of 2011/
2012 daily mean temperature, wind speed and precipitation were
12.1 °C, 3.7 km/h and 0.8 mm, while the respective values for 2012/
2013 were 12.8 °C, 4.3 km/h and 1.3 mm. The number of heating degree
days was higher during the 2011–2012 winter (1528 deg-days) com-
pared to the 2012–2013 winter (1329 deg-days) (IOBE, 2013).

2.5. Uncertainty assessment
All health impact and monetary valuation calculations were com-
puted adopting a probabilistic framework that allows the incorporation
of uncertainty and variability across the health impact pathway with
Monte Carlo sampling. The latter involved a large number of samples
(500,000 iterations were executed for each calculation on Crystal Ball;
Oracle, 2011) based on the distributions of the input parameters.
Literature-derived prior distributions with regard to CRFs and the mon-
etary valuation were used for each health endpoint. For the CRFs, a nor-
mal distribution was ﬁtted to the mean value and the respective 5% and
95% conﬁdence intervals (these are given in Table 1). For monetary val-
uation, a log-normal distribution was ﬁtted to the mean, min and max
values (given in Table 2) based on prior knowledge on the type of prob-
ability distribution characterizing expression of societal preference with
regard to willingness to pay. Exposure distributions were computed
through the INTERA platform (Sarigiannis et al., 2012), based on the dis-
tributions of ambient air concentrations, air exchange rate, penetration
coefﬁcient, PM deposition and emission rates, already described else-
where (Sarigiannis et al., 2015). Overall, a fully probabilistic heath im-
pact and monetary valuation methodology was used in the study to
ensure statistical robustness of the results and rigorous quantiﬁcation

3.1. Health impact and monetary valuation
The estimated health impact and the corresponding monetary valu-
ation for the selected mortality and morbidity indicators are illustrated
in Figs. 2 to 8. Overall, the number of excess deaths (Fig. 2) attributed to
PM exposure in the metropolitan area of Thessaloniki (with a popula-
tion of more than 1 m inhabitants) for 2011 are 1369, while the respec-
tive number for 2012 is 1287. What is signiﬁcantly different between
these two years is the distribution between the warm and the cold sea-
sons. Despite the fact that the duration of the cold period is practically
half that of the warm period, in 2012 the impacts were higher in the
cold period (728 out of 1288 annual deaths), in contrast to 526 cases
out of 1369 (annually) in 2011. Thus, the air pollution burden associated
with particulate matter during the cold season of 2012–2013 resulted in
an estimate of more than 200 excess premature deaths attributable to
airborne PM exposure than in the corresponding period in 2011–2012.
Excess mortality during the cold period of the year corresponds to
3540 years of life lost (Fig. 3) taking into account the population age
distribution.
Similar ﬁgures are derived for morbidity indices: new cases of
chronic bronchitis (Figs. 5 and 6) dominate adverse health outcomes,
followed by respiratory hospital admissions (Fig. 7) and cardiovascular
hospital admissions (Fig. 8). In the remaining scenarios, impacts are
gradually decreasing, reﬂecting the improvement of ambient and in-
door air quality resulting from the reduction of biomass and the increase
of natural gas use for space heating.
Monetary costs related to annual mortality are in the range of billion
euros no matter whether we apply the value of statistical life (VSL) or
the value of a life year (VOLY) methodology. Following the VOLY meth-
od, the estimated costs are about 30% lower, mainly reﬂecting the differ-
ent costing structures of life expectancy lost according to the age
pyramid of the population studied. Morbidity cost related to chronic
bronchitis (especially for children) is, generally, one order of magnitude
lower (hundreds of millions). Morbidity costs related to cardiovascular
and respiratory morbidity (the most directly immediate effects of in-
creased PM pollution) are in the range of million euros.
Scenario analysis showed that large beneﬁts could be expected from
potential policy interventions bearing changes in the composition of the
fuel mix used for residential heating. These beneﬁts are attributable to
the differences in particulate emissions between biomass combustion
and the competing fuels and space heating systems. The most effective
way to achieving this result would seem to be a relaxation of the high
taxation imposed in the last three years on heating oil in Greece.
4. Discussion
In this study the health impact and the associated monetary cost
of non-occupational exposure to PM in the ambient and indoor air
were assessed, focusing on the effect of the increased use of biomass
as domestic heating source. Current methodological schemes for
assessing impacts of biomass combustion rely on the association of
indoor biomass burning with several adverse health outcomes.
These studies are subject to major uncertainties related to the actual
additional burden of exposure related to inﬁltration of outdoor air in
the indoor air (Noonan and Balmes, 2010). Our methodology reduces
these uncertainties by addressing the differences related to the var-
iability of temporal emissions and the corresponding outdoor and in-
door concentrations. In this way, the impact on the urban population
is taken into account, distinguishing between households that use

biomass for indoor space heating and the ones that do not do so. The
contribution of biomass combustion indoors is very important since
uncontrolled biomass burning results in a signiﬁcant degradation of
the overall urban air quality with dire consequences on indoor air
quality from ambient air penetration indoors. Moreover, biomass
combustion sources emit particles directly into the indoor air bur-
dening it even further. Quantifying the outdoor:indoor air interac-
tions as in the present study is key for correctly estimating the
overall health burden to the urban population. According to the
WHO (2007), PM that originates from biomass burning is at least as
harmful for public health as PM coming from different combustion
sources (Naeher et al., 2007). This allows aggregate exposure to PM
from different sources (trafﬁc, other combustion and biomass burn-
ing) and environmental interactions (such as the outdoor-to-indoor
air penetration) to be tackled within a uniﬁed modeling framework,
thus providing an aggregate input for the estimation of the total
health impact on the local population. Our team has shown recently
that lung cancer risk from PAHs adsorbed onto PM emitted from bio-
mass combustion is higher than the corresponding risk from PM in
car exhaust (Sarigiannis et al., 2015). In this study, however, we
shall adopt the WHO assumption and consider similar concentra-
tion–response functions to hold for PM emitted from all combustion
sources.
Our results on health impacts concord with the ones derived by other
recent studies. A direct comparison to a conceptually similar study carried
out in Austria (Haluza et al., 2012), indicates that the expected health im-
pact attributed to PM is higher in the city of Thessaloniki. This can be ex-
plained by the overall higher levels of PM, the incorporation of actual
exposure and inhalation rate based on type and intensity of activity of
the exposed population and of the indoor:outdoor interaction in our
methodology. Moreover, we have used PM2.5 instead of PM10 as the ex-
posure metric, considering that this is more relevant for explaining the
adverse health effects of biomass burning.
Compared to the intervention study of Johnston et al. (2013), we un-
derestimate cardiac effects. This could be due to the relative paucity of
mechanistic information characterizing epidemiological studies and
the respective CRFs. Wood smoke particles are generally smaller than
1 μm, with a size distribution that peaks between 0.15 and 0.4 μm
(Hays et al., 2002). As with other combustion mixtures, such as diesel
and tobacco smoke, fresh wood smoke contains a large number of ultra-
ﬁne particles (UFPs) with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 100 μm.
UFPs condense rapidly as they cool and age. Considering that biomass-
originated PM is characterized by very low aerodynamic diameter,
PM2.5 is rather a proxy than the actual exposure metric. When ultraﬁne
PM is emitted to the atmosphere it undergoes several transformations
(hydroscopic growth, condensation, etc.), which result in very fast par-
ticle growth and the formation of PM of a larger aerodynamic diameter
(Sarigiannis et al., 2002; Sarigiannis et al., 2004). Cardiovascular disease
attributed to exposure to particulate matter is related primarily to trans-
location of ultraﬁne particles from the respiratory tract through the
alveoli via systemic circulation. Thus, cardiovascular problems and
health effects not attributed to lung or systemic inﬂammation seem to
be associated primarily with exposure to UFPs rather than larger parti-
cles (Brook, 2008). Overall, the quantiﬁcation of exposure to airborne
PM and the assessment of the associated health impact would beneﬁt
greatly from the incorporation of mechanistic elements such as
human respiratory tract deposition and oxidative stress potential in
the determination of the CRFs used for health impact assessment.

Socioeconomic status affects the use of energy resources and the ac-
tivity patterns related to speciﬁc exposure scenarios of variable intensi-
ty. Several studies have shown that variations in socioeconomic status
may have a signiﬁcant impact on human exposure to pollutants. For
example, children of lower socioeconomic status families are more vul-
nerable to asthma (Neidell, 2004; Pediatrics, 2000), while increased
mortality due to exposure to PM10 concentrations has been associated
with lower income (Forastiere et al., 2007). In addition, health status
is also affected by behavioral factors, such as nutrition, smoking, alcohol
consumption and physical activity (Arcus-Arth Broadwin and Lam,
2001; Adler and Newman, 2002); therefore, socioeconomically disad-
vantaged populations experience more often chronic diseases (e.g.,
COPD or hypertension) during their life (Lee et al., 1995). Families of
higher socioeconomic status may also invest in their health and they
may be more likely to seek preventive health care (Leaderer et al.,
1999). Since 2009 signiﬁcant reductions were observed in GDP and
available income coupled to increased unemployment in Greek cities
(IMF, 2012). All three are key determinants of population well-being.
In the period 2012–2013 the dire economic situation of Greek house-
holds was further burdened by a heavy tax on light heating diesel,

which resulted in a market price increase of ca. 50% in 2012–2013 com-
pared to that in 2011–2012. The compounded effect of reduced avail-
able income and the dramatically increased retail price of heating oil
and – to a lesser extent – of natural gas, led many households to much
cheaper fuels such as woody biomass. This, in turn, resulted in the esti-
mated increase of overall mortality attributed to PM in the cold season
of 2012–2013 compared to the one in 2011–2012.
According to the WHO, indoor smoke is ranked as the second most
important environmental health risk factor, after poor water/sanitation/
hygiene. Among all major policy-relevant risk factors, indoor air pollution
from solid fuel is tenth globally, and fourth in less developed countries
(Naeher et al., 2007). Degradation of outdoor and indoor air quality am-
pliﬁes the differences between high and low-income countries. In
Greece, the main culprits for the health burden attributed to exposure
to airborne particles have shifted recently from trafﬁc to biomass use for
heating; this observation is consistent and can be explained by the ﬁnan-
cial ﬁgures described in Fig. 9.
The latter indicate the signiﬁcant repercussions of the incumbent
ﬁnancial crisis on the average household income, which when com-
bined with the simultaneous increase in the price of light heating
diesel due to extra-heavy taxation led a large number of Greek
households to energy poverty. The associated health effects are reck-
oned to be disproportionally high compared to the short-term po-
tential ﬁnancial gains from increased taxation and similar austerity
measures. In practice, according to the Foundation for Economic
and Industrial Research (IOBE, 2013), there were no actual ﬁnancial
beneﬁts from the increased taxation of light diesel for space heating.
On the contrary, the revenues from excise tax and VAT imposed on
heating oil from the over-taxation were 187 million euros less than
the previous year in Greece. This was due to the lower amount of
heating oil taxed (2,629,931 kt in 2011–2012 compared to
1,335,083 kt in 2012–2013). Austerity measures resulted in a dra-
matic change in consumer behavior, with a consequent consumer
shift to alternative fuels for space heating (such as illicit or unregulated
biomass burning). This change resulted in both reduced tax revenues to
the state and urban air quality deterioration, which would result in an in-
crease of 40% in health burden costs between the winters of 2012–2013
and 2011–2012.
5. Conclusions
This study deals with the health and economic impact of the in-
creased biomass use in Greece taking the example of Thessaloniki,
the second largest city in the country and a major economic, indus-
trial and commercial hub in Southeastern Europe. An integrated
methodology was developed, using PM2.5 as the exposure metric
to associate adverse health outcomes through the use of well
established CRFs. Total exposure to PM was considered taking into
account outdoor:indoor air interactions, population time activity
patterns, and inhalation rate correction factors related to the intensi-
ty of the respective human activities. This was used as input to up-to-
date CRFs, and health impact assessment was coupled to monetary

valuation functions for the endpoints of interest. Results showed an
increase of about 200 excess premature deaths (out of a population
of almost 900,000 inhabitants) or 3400 YLL from all causes during
the 2012–2013 winter compared to the 2011–2012 winter. The addi-
tional health burden corresponds to an average cost ranging
between 200–250 million euros (up to 1.2 billion). Morbidity,
expressed in new cases of chronic bronchitis, cardiovascular disease
and respiratory problems, corresponds to a ﬁnancial cost on the
order of 30 million euros. The most important adverse health impact
attributed to PM exposure is chronic bronchitis in children.
Considering the high overall cost the heavy taxation of light heating
diesel in Greece should be reconsidered. Thus, the effect of biomass
displacement was evaluated by an alternative scenario analysis,
which clearly showed the beneﬁts of policy interventions that
would discourage the use of biomass as fuel source for domestic
heating. Fiscal policies at the national level should take into account
environmental health externalities and indeed consider how the in-
creased public health burden would inﬂuence mid- and long-term ﬁ-
nancial turnovers.
Based on the results of the study and taking into account the impor-
tance of public health and the related socioeconomic cost, speciﬁc inter-
ventions are recommended, such as:
– Reduction of the price of light heating diesel through relaxation of
the related excise tax
– Financial incentives for light heating diesel replacement by natural
gas or electricity
– Enhancement of the support given to residential energy conserva-
tion schemes and simpliﬁcation of the relevant regulatory frame-
work to ease the access of larger numbers of households to such
programs.
If biomass continues to be used, then the following need to be taken
into consideration to reduce population exposure to ﬁne and ultraﬁne
particles:
– Closed ﬁreplaces are more efﬁcient in terms of heating performance
as well PM emissions. In that case, indoor PM emissions are almost
negligible.
– Emission factors for ﬁne particles are highly dependent on fuel char-
acteristics and burn conditions (smoldering vs. ﬂaming). Similarly,
emission factors for speciﬁc organic chemicals are inﬂuenced by
fuel moisture content and burning conditions (Guillén and
Ibargoitia, 1999; Khalil and Rasmussen, 2003). Thus, frequent venti-
lation of indoor spaces, good combustion conditions and high quali-
ty, low moisture wood would ensure relatively controlled direct
exposure to the urban population.

Health implications of air pollution vary dependent upon pollutant sources. This work determines the value, in
terms of reduced mortality, of reducing ambient particulate matter (PM2.5: effective aerodynamic diameter 2.5
μm or less) concentration due to different emission sources. Suva, a Paciﬁc Island city with substantial input
from combustion sources, is used as a case-study. Elemental concentration was determined, by ion beam analysis,
for PM2.5 samples from Suva, spanning one year. Sources of PM2.5 have been quantiﬁed by positive matrix
factorisation. A review of recent literature has been carried out to delineate the mortality risk associated with
these sources. Risk factors have then been applied for Suva, to calculate the possible mortality reduction that
may be achieved through reduction in pollutant levels. Higher risk ratios for black carbon and sulphur resulted
in mortality predictions for PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, road vehicle emissions and waste burning that sur-
pass predictions for these sources based on health risk of PM2.5 mass alone. Predicted mortality for Suva from fos-
sil fuel smoke exceeds the national toll from road accidents in Fiji. The greatest beneﬁt for Suva, in terms of
reduced mortality, is likely to be accomplished by reducing emissions from fossil fuel combustion (diesel), vehi-
cles and waste burning.

1. Introduction
It is well established that increased PM2.5 (particulate matter with
equivalent aerodynamic diameter 2.5 μm or less) concentrations relate
to adverse health impacts. Short and long term exposures to even low
levels of PM2.5 have been associated with all-cause mortality (Kloog
et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2016), with no evidence of a threshold below
which effects are not observed (Pope and Dockery, 2006; Brook et al.,
2010). Hoek et al. (2013) reviewed available studies, ﬁnding that the
risk of premature mortality due to PM2.5 increases by 6% per 10 μg/m3
increase in PM2.5; 11% for cardiovascular mortality. As coronary heart
disease is the leading cause of death in Fiji (Ministry of Health and
Medical Services, 2015), health implications of air quality warrant in-
vestigation. Associations have been made between PM2.5 and diabetes
(Potera, 2014; Rao et al., 2015), also a major cause of death in Fiji
(Ministry of Health and Medical Services, 2015); deep vein thrombosis
and pulmonary embolism (Kloog et al., 2015), as well as dementia,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2016). Health
care access and health education also inﬂuence susceptibility to impacts
arising from PM2.5 exposure (Garcia et al., 2016).
Certain PM2.5 constituents are more harmful than others (Bell et al.,
2014; Dai et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2015; Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2015;
Jia et al., 2017). In a toxicology study, Roper et al. (2017) reported the
most signiﬁcant associations of PM2.5 with lung tissue inﬂammatory re-
sponse from sampling sites with the lowest PM2.5 concentrations; dem-
onstrating that PM2.5 concentration alone is not a satisfactory measure
of health risk (similarly, Hao et al., 2016). Understanding of the health
risk of PM2.5 components, and the mechanism for toxicity, is still devel-
oping (Huang et al., 2014; Atkinson et al., 2015; Gray et al., 2015; Tong
et al., 2015; Weber et al., 2015). Recent research has explored the role of
oxidative potential, relating it to cardiovascular and respiratory health
impacts (Weber et al., 2015; Lakey et al., 2016; Pei et al., 2016; Sarnat
et al., 2016; Weichenthal et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). Weber et al.
(2015) reported vehicle emissions and biomass burning sources to ex-
hibit higher oxidative potential and hence higher toxicity than other
sources. Air pollution control measures should include consideration
of components, particularly those with high toxicities, rather than
PM2.5 mass alone (Liu, 2016). In particular, Eklund et al. (2014) advocate
use of black carbon (BC) in air quality regulations, as an indicator of ad-
verse health effects, due to the consistency of observed associations.
The disparate toxicity of PM2.5 components is of relevance for the Pa-
ciﬁc Islands, where diesel combustion and waste burning contribute sig-
niﬁcantly to the particulate loading (Periathamby et al., 2009; Mataki,
2011; Owens et al., 2011; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014; Escofﬁer et al.,
2016; Taibi et al., 2016). For Suva, PM2.5 levels are within World Health
Organization guidelines (7.4 ± 0.3 μg/m3 annual average of Wednes-
days and Sundays) yet black carbon in PM2.5 (2.2 ± 0.1 μg/m3) is similar
to levels in much larger cities (Isley et al., 2017) highlighting the need
for further investigation of air pollutant sources in order to facilitate
more effective air quality management. Source contributions to PM2.5
for Suva would be typical of dominant of emission contributions across
all the Paciﬁc Islands. Similarly, other developing communities in Africa,
Asia and South America that share similar climate, burning practices
and usage of diesel are likely to be equally affected.
An emissions inventory (Isley et al., 2016) showed diesel vehicle
emissions to be the largest source of BC in Suva. Emissions data was dif-
ﬁcult to obtain, meaning that sources may have been underestimated.
Calculated per-capita BC emissions for Suva were comparable to regions
with much lower ambient BC than Suva, indicating that the inventory
may not fully represent local emissions (Isley et al., 2016). Further
data are required to accurately deﬁne emission contributions. Alterna-
tively, elemental concentration data may be used to statistically model
sources. This has been attempted by Garimella and Deo (2007); who
interpreted elemental concentration data in Suva to provide qualitative
conclusions about PM sources. By comparing PM concentrations to the
earth's crust, Garimella and Deo (2007) concluded that Suva's PM was
dominated by marine aerosols, with possible inputs from automobile
exhaust. Source apportionment in Garimella and Deo's (2007) study
was constrained by identiﬁcation of only 5% of total PM mass. This
study aims to further that work, using a suite of elements likely to iden-
tify a larger proportion of particulate mass; H, Na, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti,
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Sr, Pb, N and BC. Because of the well-
deﬁned health implications identiﬁed above, this study focuses on
PM2.5. In order to make the study data more speciﬁcally applicable to fu-
ture Fijian air policy and health risk assessments, PM2.5 sources will be
deﬁned quantitatively using the positive matrix factorisation (PMF)
method.
The PMF technique (Paatero and Tapper, 1994; Paatero, 2000b;
Paatero, 2000a) identiﬁes statistical groupings of elements (source fac-
tors) within total PM2.5 mass; which are then related to emission
sources using known elemental ratios. Many recent source apportion-
ment studies have used PMF (Belis et al., 2013; Karagulian et al.,
2015), particularly due to its differentiation of sources that share com-
mon elements. This is an important advantage for Suva, where many
combustion sources share BC, H and S.
The objective of this paper is to quantitatively identify source contri-
butions to the total PM2.5 burden of Suva's air and to determine the mor-
tality risk presented by these factors. This will enable more effective and
targeted air quality policy in Fiji.
2. Method
2.1. Sampling
Sampling was carried out in Suva city centre, at −18.13°S, 178.42°E.
On the west coast of the Suva peninsula, the site is located atop a 4-level
building, at approximately 18 m height and 20 m elevation. The city
markets, Suva bus terminal, Walu Bay industrial area and shipping
port activities all lie within 1 km of this site. This site was selected as
it is downwind of Suva City and would indicate the sources that people
living and working in Suva are exposed to. Meteorological data
(Australian Government, 2016) were obtained from instruments co-

as locations of major industries and other emission sources.

located at the site. A map of the sampling site, showing signiﬁcant local
sources is shown in Fig. 1.
Samples were collected for 24-hour periods (midnight to midnight)
between November 2014 and October 2015 each Wednesday and Sun-
day. In addition, intensive campaigns covering approximately three
weeks in total, allowed for more frequent sample collection during
April/May 2015 and October 2015. Stretched Teﬂon ﬁlters (15 mm)
were used to collect samples, using an Aerosol Sampling Program
(ASP) cyclone sampler, built by the Australian Nuclear Science and
Technology Organisation (ANSTO) according to the IMPROVE design
(Cohen, 1996) and operating at 22 L/min ﬂowrate. The ASP samplers
have been shown to have good agreement with Beta Attenuation Mon-
itors (BAMs) (Hibberd et al., 2013; Hibberd et al., 2016). One ﬁeld blank
for the ASP PM2.5 sampler was collected for every ten exposed samples.
2.2. Laboratory analyses
Concentration of PM2.5 was determined by weighing ﬁlters under
controlled temperature (approx. 22 °C) and relative humidity condi-
tions (approx. 50%) before and after exposure. Black carbon (BC) was
determined from the ﬁlters using the Laser Integrated Plate Method
(LIPM). The BC concentration is estimated from two transmission mea-
surements from a HeNe laser (wavelength 633 nm) performed on each
ﬁlter before and after exposure; assuming a mass absorption coefﬁcient
value of 7 m2/g for carbon particles (Taha et al., 2007). This BC determi-
nation method, performed at ANSTO, has shown good agreement with
IMPROVE-A thermal optical methods (Hibberd et al., 2016) and thermal
desorption methods (Hibberd et al., 2013). Isley et al. (2017) provide a
thorough analysis of gravimetric PM2.5 and black carbon results for Suva
(the same data used in this study), including detail on quality control
and comparison to other measurement methods.
Elemental concentrations were determined by ion beam analysis
(IBA), a non-destructive technique established for the characterisation
of particulate sources (Crawford et al., 2016; Manousakas et al., 2017).
Analysis was carried out at ANSTO on a 2 MV Tandetron accelerator.
Four simultaneous techniques were applied: particle-induced X-ray
emission for concentrations of elements from Al to Pb; particle-
induced gamma-ray emission for Na, F, Al, Mg and Li; Rutherford back-
scattering to determine total C, N and O; and elastic recoil detection for
total H. The application of these methods to air pollution source appor-
tionment are discussed in Cohen et al. (2014); including the use of the
PIXAN analysis code, the technique used here to extract the elemental
concentrations from the spectrum peaks. Examples of spectrum graphs
for Suva samples and blanks as well as calibration details and plots for
ion beam analysis are included as Supplementary Section C. Average
ﬁeld blank levels of the analysed species in the particle samples were
equivalent to 0.0015 μg/m3 (b0.02 μg/cm2 on ﬁlters) with the majority
of ﬁeld blank values were below the method detection limit. The aver-
age detection limit for the particulate matter species was 0.0036 μg/
m3; ranging from 0.00025 μg/m3 for Ni to 0.043 μg/m3 for Na; with av-
erage error of 0.36% over all species. Error and method detection limit
matrices were inputted to the PMF analysis.
2.3. Determination of source factors
Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) was conducted at ANSTO, using
the original DOS version of the PMF analysis codes (PMF2-DOS) devel-
oped by Paatero and Tapper (1994). These have been demonstrated to
show good agreement with other PMF versions (Ramadan et al., 2003;
Kim and Hopke, 2007; Kim et al., 2010; Hibberd et al., 2013). PMF uti-
lises a measurement matrix X(n,m) [n samples, m chemical species]
which is factorised into smaller matrices factor(p,m) [p factors, m ele-
ments] and contribution(n,p) [p factors for each of the n samples];
each constrained to positive values. Then X(n, m) = factors(p,m) ×
contribution(n,p) + error(n,m); with the error matrix minimised in the
PMF process. The PMF analysis was performed multiple times, each
time incrementing the number of source factors. The criteria used to de-
termine a suitable ﬁt for the source factor analysis were: all average fac-
tor contributions to total PM2.5 mass were N1%; all factors were positive;
all regression coefﬁcients were positive; all p-values were b0.05 and χ2
is close to one. These statistical criteria were satisﬁed when eight source
factors (χ2 = 0.997) or nine source factors (χ2 = 0.748) were assumed.
The eight and nine factor PMF model scenarios provided similar re-
sults. The nine-factor model is discussed in this paper. Elemental contri-
butions to each factor in the eight factor model are included, for
comparison, as Supplementary Fig. A1; further comparison between
eight and nine factor scenarios is provided throughout the supplemen-
tary material. Uncertainty due to differences in modelled source

mass. The vertical axis of each graph has been normalised so that the main element in
each factor has a fractional contribution value of one.
452
C.F. Isley et al. / Science of the Total Environment 612 (2018) 450–461
contributions between the two models are included in health risk calcu-
lations (Supplementary Section B). The primary difference between the
eight and nine factor PMF models is the inclusion of a second road vehi-
cle factor. This extra factor, with 8 ± 2% contribution, is not formed by
splitting the road vehicle factor, as it appears in the eight-factor
model, but instead by re-distributing all elements, effectively reducing
each of factors by a small percentage (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. A1).
In terms of the contribution to total PM2.5 mass, the ranking of sources
from highest contribution to lowest contribution does not change be-
tween eight and nine factor models, except for slight variation in the
smallest two factors. Percentage of total mass for each element, appor-
tioned to each factor, is shown in Supplementary Fig. A2. These remain
fairly consistent between the eight and nine factor models, although in-
clusion of the second road vehicle source factor in the nine factor model
causes some redistribution of elements. Plots of the daily occurrence of
each factor, by mass, show general similarity between eight and nine
factor models (Supplementary Fig. A3 and percentage contribution
Fig. A4).
More than 99% of the gravimetric mass was explained in the PMF
model, with R2 = 0.99 (Supplementary Fig. A5). This result represents
a signiﬁcant improvement on the particulate mass percentages able to
be identiﬁed in previous studies (Garimella and Deo, 2007). In general,
modelled PMF mass for each element show very good ﬁt against IBA
mass (Supplementary Figs. A6 and A7). The IBA v PMF ﬁt for Cr and Co
was poor compared to other species, due to the high instance of concen-
trations below the detection limit. Still, these results do not adversely af-
fect the determination of source factors.
2.4. Meteorology
Meteorological data used in this study are based on hourly-averaged
wind speed and direction data collected by the Australian Bureau of Me-
teorology (Australian Government, 2016) at the Suva city air sampling
site. A summary of meteorological data, for the October 2014 to October
2015 period and their inﬂuence on PM2.5 mass and BC concentration,
are given in Isley et al. (2017). The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian In-
tegrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model (Stein et al., 2015) has been used
to calculate back trajectories. These have been calculated, commencing
at three-hourly intervals, for a total of 24 h before arrival at the Suva City
site, using an hourly timestep.
2.5. Risk analysis
Risk estimates were calculated for PM2.5 and its components in Suva,
using risk data from literature (included in Results). Mortality implica-
tions of risk were calculated according to a human health impact func-
tion (Cohen et al., 2004; Lelieveld et al., 2013; Fann, 2015; Broome et al.,
2016; United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017), using:

To demonstrate this, mortality risk calculations for road vehicle PM
have been included as Supplementary Section B. For Fiji, the baseline
mortality rate is 8 per 1000 (Ministry of Health and Medical Services,
2015). The exposed population is 143,900 (Fiji Bureau of Statistics,
2007; World Population Review, 2017); being residents of Greater
Suva (council areas of Suva, Lami, Nasinu and Nausori, Fig. 1) aged
N30 years. This age group is selected as it relates most closely to
epidemiologically based risk data (World Health Organization, 2013a;
Lelieveld et al., 2015; Broome et al., 2016).
3. Results
3.1. PMF data analysis
Elemental constituents of the source factors determined by PMF for
the Suva PM2.5 samples are shown in Table 1. Percentage mass con-
tribution of each factor are separated for Sunday and mid-week samples
as well as for wet and dry seasons. A comparison of the mass differences
for each source factor, averaged over one year, is also shown by wet/dry
season and week-day/Sunday.
In terms of the contribution to total PM2.5 mass, the largest source is
sea aerosol, followed by smoke from fossil fuels, secondary sulphates,
road vehicles, smoke from open burning, windblown soil, industry Ca
(an industrial source high in Ca) and heavy fuel oil. Back trajectory dia-
grams showing paths for air parcels 1 h prior to arrival in Suva city have
been drawn for the peak 5% of occurrence of each source (Supplemen-
tary Fig. A8). These back-trajectories show that air has typically trav-
elled mainly over open ocean in the hour prior to sampling in Suva.
However for some sources (secondary sulphates, road vehicles, smoke
from open burning, heavy fuel oil and industry Ca), these back-
trajectories include airﬂow paths over Fijian land.
3.2. PM2.5 source characteristics
The identifying features of each source factor are listed below. Wind
conditions under which peaks of each factor occurred are shown in
Fig. 3 and HYSPLIT back trajectories for each factor in Supplementary
Fig. A8.
3.2.1. Sea aerosols
The largest factor identiﬁed in Suva's PM2.5 was sea aerosol; com-
prising Cl, Na, BC, S, K, Ca, H, Si, Br and Ti (Fig. 2). The sea aerosol factor
has a Cl/Na ratio of 1.56, representing fresh sea salt. Surface sea water
has a Cl/Na, molar ratio of 1.16 (Keene et al., 1986), which is a mass
ratio of 1.8. Whilst there is a slight loss of Cl compared with sea water;
this factor has a similar Cl/Na ratio to sea aerosols measured at
Australia's Cape Grim coastal air monitoring station (Cohen et al.,
2014). Peak occurrence of the sea aerosol factor coincide with moderate
winds (4 m/s to over 7 m/s), mainly from the southeast; being, on aver-
age, 11% higher than 2014–2015 wind speed averages for Suva. The
presence of black carbon (BC) in this factor, accounting for approxi-
mately 16% of total BC (Supplementary Fig. A2), may show inﬂuence
from shipping sources in the Paciﬁc or land-based emissions in Suva,
mixing with sea-spray. Still, this proportion of BC in sea aerosol is simi-
lar to Australian sites (Cohen et al., 2014). Long-range sources may also
contribute to BC (Andreae, 1983; Liu et al., 2011).
3.2.2. Smoke from fossil fuels
The smoke from the fossil fuels factor is driven by BC and contains H
and S, which are characteristic of smoke. As K is not present, this indi-
cates an absence of biomass burning as a contributing source. Smoke
from fossil fuels contributes 21% to total PM2.5 mass and 57% of total
BC mass (Supplementary Fig. A2). Given that coal burning does not
occur in this region, this factor is likely to represent primarily diesel
emissions.
Prevailing winds during peak detection days were from the south-
east, as is typical for Suva, which would transport emissions from small-
er shipping vessels off the coast of Fiji (discussed below). Yet, 49% of
winds (peak detection days) are from the northeast quadrant. More
than one-third of all wind speeds (peak detection days) were below
2 m/s; with the majority (70%) of low-speed winds occurring in the
northeast quadrant. Relevantly, Suva's two thermal (diesel oil and
453
C.F. Isley et al. / Science of the Total Environment 612 (2018) 450–461
residual oil) power generation plants are positioned to the northeast of
the sampling area, at Kinoya (Fig. 1).
Contributions would also include industrial activity directly to the
northeast of the sampling site (1 km), where the steel recycling mill,
ﬂour mill, brewery and several smaller industries operate. Under low-
speed northeasterly winds, emissions from these industries and
smoke from vehicles in Suva would not disperse readily and would
therefore be likely to be detected more strongly at the sampling site.
Peak concentrations of this factor occurred in April and May of 2015
(Fig. A3). When considered as a percentage of total PM2.5, peak values
for this factor are more evenly distributed across the year (Fig. A4).
As mentioned above, small shipping craft around Suva would con-
tribute to this fossil fuel factor. Internationally, non-cargo vessels; pas-
senger and ﬁshing ships, tugboats and others; represent 50% of the
shipping ﬂeet (Eyring et al., 2005). Fuel use and accurate current
registration statistics for small shipping vessels in Paciﬁc Island coun-
tries including Fiji are difﬁcult to obtain (Holland et al., 2014), however
observations of port activities during ﬁeld sampling indicated that
smaller vessels comprise around half of the shipping ﬂeet in Suva.
Holland et al. (2014) calculate, for Fiji, that shipping accounts for 22%
of all fuel imports, representing up to 325 million litres of fuel annually;
with the ﬂeet being ‘typically made up of old, poorly maintained fossil fuel
[diesel] powered vessels’ p. 94.
Fuel usage may also be higher than reported, as some vessels re-fuel
outside of port and this is not included in national statistics (Eyring
et al., 2005). These shipping emissions were not included in previous
emission estimates for Suva (Isley et al., 2016), which provides some ex-
planation for high ambient concentrations of black carbon by compari-
son with emissions estimates. Whilst larger ships tend to use heavy fuel
oil, smaller ships use either marine diesel or automotive diesel.

Marine diesel typically contains around 0.155% sulphur by mass
(Kasper et al., 2007), over three times the sulphur content in Fiji's auto-
motive diesel. Whilst marine diesel contains 50 times less sulphur than
heavy fuel oil, particulate emissions were found to be only a factor of
two lower (Winnes and Fridell, 2009). Marine diesel does not contain
the nickel and vanadium characteristic of heavy fuel oil (Kasper et al.,
2007), meaning that marine diesel would not appear in the ‘heavy fuel
oil’ source, but would rather appear here in the ‘smoke from fossil
fuels’ source.
Very small boats in Fiji, that have outboard motors, use the same pet-
rol and diesel fuel as brushcutters, generators and motor vehicles
(Holland et al., 2014). Petrol and diesel-fueled craft are also common
in other Paciﬁc Islands (Paciﬁc Regional Data Repository, 2015). Because
two-stroke outboard engines burn oil, they emit high levels of particles
compared to other engine types, including car engines (Department of
the Environment and Water Resources, 2007; Kasper et al., 2007).
These very small boats are largely unregulated in Fiji.
3.2.3. Secondary sulphate
The secondary sulphate factor represents a composite of sulphates
from natural marine sources and anthropogenic sources. Secondary sul-
phates form when SO2 is scavenged by water droplets and is oxidised to
sulphate, over a period of approximately one day, effectively mixing
particles from multiple emission sources. Considering that air arrives
in Suva after travelling hundreds of kilometers over the Paciﬁc Ocean,
spending only minutes, on average, over the land area of Suva (Isley
et al., 2017), there is little time for emissions from land-based activities
to be converted to sulphates. Ocean-derived biogenic sulphur, due to
phytoplankton blooms, has been shown to contribute to inland aerosols
(Gaston et al., 2010). This algal source is anticipated to contribute signif-
icantly to Suva's secondary sulphates. Whilst Suva does not experience
highly distinct summer and winter seasons, the secondary sulphate fac-
tor displays seasonality (Supplementary Figs. A3 and A4). Peaks in the
summer months (December to February) correspond to peak phyto-
plankton activity. Emissions from shipping in the Paciﬁc, particularly
the use of high-sulphur fuels, would also contribute to secondary sul-
phates. Back trajectory modelling (Supplementary Fig. A8), shows that
some peak days for this factor correspond to periods when, quite unusu-
ally, the air mass has come from over the land area of Fiji. This indicates
that local, human-inﬂuenced sources, such as industrial activity and ve-
hicles, also contribute to secondary sulphates.
3.2.4. Road vehicles
The ‘road vehicles 1’ factor is driven by H and S, whereas for ‘road ve-
hicles 2’, BC is the key component. Both of these factors contain ele-
ments relating to road-dust (Fe, Si and Ti), fuel and lubricant (Na, Zn,
Br and Ca). The high sulphur in ‘road vehicles 1’ factor may indicate
that it relates to vehicles using diesel fuels, containing up to 500 ppm
sulphur. This would include most heavy vehicles such as trucks and
buses. Moreover, the ‘road vehicles 1’ factor also shows higher propor-
tions of road dust elements, consistent with the higher amounts of
dust suspended with increasing vehicle mass (United States Environ-
mental Protection Agency, 2006b). Peak levels of the ‘road vehicles 1’
factor occurred mainly under easterly and east-northeasterly conditions
(Fig. 3); which is downwind of Suva's main bus stand.
The ‘road vehicles 2’ factor differs in that its peak occurrence relates
to winds from the northeast, which contains the highly populated resi-
dential area of Suva; along with trafﬁc corridors to the outer areas of
Nasinu and Nausori (Fig. 1). Trafﬁc emissions occur over a wide area
of Suva and a lack of detailed trafﬁc data in Fiji make it difﬁcult to char-
acterise vehicle emissions comprehensively. The presence of Pb in the
‘road vehicle 1’ factor may be due to brake wear (Pant and Harrison,
2013), or resuspension of roadside dust; which has been shown to con-
tain up to 5161 mg/kg (Department of Environment Fiji, 2007).
3.2.5. Smoke from open burning
Smoke from the open burning factor is differentiated from the fossil
fuel smoke factor by the high K content, indicative of biomass burning.
Open burning of wastes is practiced widely across the Paciﬁc Islands.
In Suva, more than half of households burn a portion of household
waste and greenwaste (Isley et al., 2016). Although waste burning activ-
ities are more concentrated in residential areas, the data shows that this
source factor represents 7 ± 1% of PM2.5 mass measured in Suva's city
centre. It is not surprising therefore, that peak occurrence of this factor
coincides with a high proportion of winds emanating from the residen-
tial areas in the northeast sector of Suva (Fig. 3). Back-trajectories for
this factor (Supplementary Fig. A8) also include air parcels originating
from northeasterly areas of Suva in the hour prior to sampling.
3.2.6. Soil
A Soil factor is characterised by Si, Al, Na, H, K, Ca and total N. This
factor contains contributions from windblown soils, including dust
emissions due to vehicles on unsealed roads and agricultural distur-
bance of soils. Peak detections of this factor were associated with south-
easterly winds over 4 m/s. This is not surprising, as soil erosion potential
of exposed areas increases rapidly with increasing wind speed (United
States Environmental Protection Agency, 2006a). The soil factor is also
related to northeasterly winds from the inland areas of Suva (Fig. 3).
3.2.7. Industry Ca
A source that was characterised by a high calcium content, labelled
‘industry Ca’ appears to represent a combination of emissions from ce-
ment industry operations at Lami and Nasinu and quarrying activities
at Nasinu (Fig. 1). Several smaller cement industry operations also
occur throughout the Suva area. Peak concentrations of this source fac-
tor occurred predominately under northeasterly wind conditions, from
the direction of Nasinu (Fig. 3). Back trajectories (Supplementary Fig.
A8) show also that air parcels originate from the northwest where
larger-scale concrete industry operations are present in Lami.
3.2.8. Heavy fuel oil
A source factor representative of heavy fuel oil emissions was also
identiﬁed, primarily due to the V/Ni ratio of 3.13, which is consistent
with heavy fuel oil sources (Viana et al., 2014). This source factor is typ-
ically referred to as ‘shipping’ emissions by many authors (Pandolﬁ
et al., 2011; Kuang et al., 2015), as it represents emissions from large
ships that typically combust heavy fuel oil. The use of diesel fuels
other than heavy fuel oil by many ships in Fiji means that a label of ‘ship-
ping’ from this source would be an under-representation of the total im-
pact of shipping on Suva's PM2.5. Peak values for this factor were
associated with an unusually large proportion of winds from the south-
west, the location of Suva Harbour.
3.3. Implications for mortality
A summary of the available literature addressing the health impacts
of PM2.5 components is provided in Table 2. This has been limited to
studies published since 2014, as published reviews (included in
Table 2) cover the period prior to 2014. From the studies presented, it
is clear that PM2.5 composition plays an important role in the resultant
health effects from exposure. Oil burning, vehicle-related PM, various
metals and BC/EC are amongst the PM2.5 components for which health
impacts have most commonly been reported, however results have var-
ied between studies. In summary of Table 2, the risk from PM2.5 sources,
relevant to Suva, is: sea aerosol – inconclusive; fossil fuels – ischemic
heart disease, lung cancer, inﬂammatory response and DNA damage;
secondary sulphates – respiratory disease, mortality; road vehicles –
respiratory and cardiovascular risk, affects cellular function, mortality
association; open burning – lung cancer risk; soil – inconclusive, though
Si is associated with mortality; heavy fuel oil – cardio vascular
hospitalisations and adverse impact on survival. Relationship of PM2.5

sources to health impacts is a complex problem, due to the difference in
PM2.5 mixtures from one location to another as well as ﬁndings that the
toxicity of mixed PM2.5 components appears to differ greatly to that of
individual components (Jia et al., 2017). Many studies in Table 2 relate
to short-term exposures or speciﬁc demographic groups. For many
sources or components, there is therefore insufﬁcient information to
make clear inferences about health risk (Wyzga and Rohr, 2015). Gener-
alised risk estimates (long-term mortality) were reported for S, elemen-
tal carbon (EC), Si and NO3
−and diesel EC (Table 2).
For determining the mortality implications of total PM2.5 concentra-
tion, a value of 1.06 (CI 1.04,1.08) per 10 μg/m3 increase (Hoek et al.,
2013) was used, as recommended by the World Health Organization
(2013a) and used in (Broome et al., 2016). Hoek et al.'s (2013) risk es-
timate was based on a comprehensive review of risk assessment stud-
ies. Based on EC and BC studies, Hoek et al. (2013) estimated mortality
risk of 1.06 (CI 1.05,1.07) per 1 μg/m3 EC increase. Chung et al.'s
(2015) epidemiological assessment using seven years of data from
518 PM2.5 monitoring stations in the United States of America (USA) es-
timated EC mortality risk at 1.013% (95% posterior interval (PI): 1.003,
1.022) per one standard deviation (SD = 0.24 μg/m3) increase; consis-
tent with Hoek et al. (2013). Measurements of BC and EC have been
shown to be approximately comparable (BC:EC = 1 ± 0.3) (United
States Environmental Protection Agency, 2012). To account for this un-
certainty in comparing EC and BC, mortality risk for Suva will be calcu-
lated using 1.045 (1.04 to 1.07) per 1 μg/m3 BC increase. Further risk
estimates are available for trafﬁc related EC, S and Si. These risks were
determined from only one study, in different settings to Suva, hence
they must be used with caution. They will be considered only to explore
potential risk in Suva. Thurston et al. (2016) followed 445,860 adults in
100 metropolitan areas for 23 years; diesel trafﬁc related EC to be asso-
ciated with mortality (risk = 1.03; CI: 1.00, 1.06 per 0.26 μg/m3 EC in-
crease); a rate of 1.021 (1.00, 1.06) per 0.26 μg/m3 BC was used to
account for any BC/EC differences. Beelen et al.'s (2015) study of 19
European cohorts, determined risk from PM2.5 sulphur (1.14; 95% CI:
1.06, 1.23 per 0.2 μg/m3), robust to adjustment for other pollutants
and PM2.5. Chung et al. (2015) reported risk for Si (1.014, 95% PI:
1.006, 1.024 for 1 SD = 0.2 μg/m3 increase).
Reducing PM2.5 concentration in Suva has the potential to reduce an-
nual mortality. Potential mortality reductions for greater Suva (council
areas Suva, Lami, Nasinu and Nausori), for age group N30 years
(143,900 people), are listed in Table 3 and Fig. 4. Firstly, mortality reduc-
tion has been presented according to the health risk of PM2.5 mass; for
total PM2.5 and then for each component of PM2.5, as identiﬁed in the
PMF modelling. No data are presented for sea salt as these natural emis-
sions cannot be easily reduced. Following this, potential mortality re-
duction has been presented for risk data speciﬁc to sources or
components of PM2.5; BC, trafﬁc-related BC, S and Si. Major sources con-
tributing to BC, S and Si have also been considered separately. Calcula-
tions have been based on the average of Wednesday and Sunday
PM2.5 concentrations for 2014–2015, 7.4 μg/m3. This may underesti-
mate PM2.5 concentration and hence mortality risk in Suva, as Sunday
levels were 30% less than weekday levels and as PM2.5 concentrations
reported for residential areas were higher than for the city (Isley et al.,
2017).
4. Discussion
4.1. PM2.5 sources
Modelling of source factors for the Suva city site, under either model,
shows that the majority of PM2.5 mass originates from human activity,
particularly combustion activities. Of this, a large proportion of PM2.5
is from fossil fuel smoke, but apportionment to speciﬁc individual in-
dustrial emission sources is not possible. Vehicle emissions were

identiﬁed in distinct road vehicle factors, in addition to the fossil fuel
factor. The combined contribution of road vehicle factors in the nine fac-
tor model, at 17% of PM2.5 mass, is lower than the 25% global average for
trafﬁc contributions (Karagulian et al., 2015). Given that vehicle
registrations are increasing across Fiji and the Paciﬁc Island Countries
(Thoma, 2014; Fiji Bureau of Statistics, 2017); with Solomon Islands
reporting over 60% increase in three years (World Health Organization,
2013b; World Health Organization, 2016) measures to control this source
are becoming increasingly important.
Suva's PM2.5 sources varied from weekday to weekend. The mass at-
tributed to the ‘road vehicles 2’ factor and to the open burning factor
were around three times higher for midweek samples compared with
weekend (Sunday) samples. A number of other sources; soil, industry
Ca, road vehicles 1 and smoke from fossil fuels also showed higher
mass midweek (1.5 to 2.4 times higher) than on Sundays. Very limited
commercial and business activities are conducted on Sundays in Suva
and so it follows that there are less vehicle movements to create exhaust
emissions and suspended road dust; and less industrial or vehicle emis-
sions contributing to the ‘smoke from fossil fuels’ factor. Further, agri-
cultural and industrial operations, related to the soil and industry Ca
sources, would also be reduced on Sundays. The smoke from open burn-
ing factor also shows reduced contribution on Sundays, which is consis-
tent with this it being reserved as a church day and day of rest for many
in Fiji, resulting in less clearing and burning of yard waste. By contrast,
sea aerosols, secondary sulphates and heavy fuel oil factors were similar
on weekdays and Sundays, with ratios ranging from 0.8 to 1.3. Ocean
aerosols represent a natural consistent source not dependent on anthro-
pogenic processes. Similarly, secondary sulphates and heavy fuel oil
emissions are expected to remain similar across the week with ships
working to move goods and passengers regardless of the day.
Source contributions also varied by season. Road vehicles 2, soil and
industry Ca factors were approximately double, by mass, during the dry
season compared to wet season. Dust emissions are related to moisture
contents of exposed areas and therefore in the dry season dust emis-
sions from unsealed roads and work yards, exposed areas, agricultural
and industrial activities are increased (United States Environmental
Protection Agency, 2006b). Likewise for Industry Ca, particle emissions
rates for concrete manufacturing processes and quarrying activities are
subject to the moisture content of material being handled (Department
of the Environment and Energy, 2008; Department of Sustainability
Environment Water Population and Communities, 2012).
4.2. Implications for mortality
Potential mortality impact for Suva, based on PM2.5 mass, represents
a rate of 0.34/1000 persons (Table 3, mortality estimate divided by
Suva's population of 330,000). Lelieveld et al. (2015) estimated mortal-
ity based on PM2.5 mass in the Western Paciﬁc (including Paciﬁc Islands
and China) to be 0.85/1000; projected to increase to 1.2/1000 if air pol-
lution sources were not addressed. By comparison, Australia had an es-
timated 0.2/1000 deaths attributable to urban air pollution (Australian
Government Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016; Australian Bureau
of Statistics, 2017). Estimates based on non-speciﬁc PM2.5 mass may un-
derestimate mortality, especially where, as in Suva, carbon compounds
contribute strongly to PM2.5 (Lelieveld et al., 2015). When toxicity of
components is considered, potential mortality may be up to 0.67/1000
for Suva.
Mortality risk of BC from road vehicles could be responsible for
around 20 deaths per year in Suva, or higher if using risk ratios for
trafﬁc-related BC. Smoke from fossil fuels has an even higher impact
on mortality predictions; with predictions (Table 3) exceeding the na-
tion's road toll of 41 in 2012 (Fiji Land Transport Authority, 2013). Fossil
fuel smoke sources implicated from analysis of wind conditions
(Section 3.1, Fig. 3) are shipping (diesel), power generation (diesel
and residual oil) and diesel burning by Walu Bay industries: steel
recycling mill, port-related industries, ﬂour mill, brewery and other
small industries. Trafﬁc emissions may also contribute to this fossil
fuel smoke factor. The sea aerosol factor in Suva comprises an average
of 0.4 μg/m3 BC, meaning that it also carries mortality risk. This is likely

Potential mortality reduction calculated for greater Suva, for ages N30 years, due to reduc-
tion in different PM2.5 sources. The upper section shows reductions calculated using risk
data for total PM2.5. Lower sections use risk data for PM2.5 components. Whilst 100% reduc-
tion of PM2.5 from a given source is unlikely, this is listed in order to demonstrate the com-
parative mortality risk of different PM2.5 components. Risks marked * are based on only
one study and should be considered only for the purpose of exploring risk potential in Su-
va. Ranges shown in brackets relate to the 95% conﬁdence interval from risk estimate data
as well as uncertainty in PMF modelling. Calculations are shown in Supplementary

to be largely due to shipping and long range BC transport (Section 3.1),
making BC from this source difﬁcult to reduce.
The potential risk of S in PM2.5 indicates that secondary sulphates,
smoke from open burning and road vehicles represents the most signiﬁ-
cant mortality risk of the emission sources modelled. Secondary sulphates
in Suva represent a composite of biogenic marine sources with shipping
emissions and land-based combustion emissions (Section 3.1); the rela-
tive contributions of these sources are unknown. It is also not known
how the source of secondary sulphates affects their toxicity. Biogenic ma-
rine sulphates are an unmodiﬁable risk, largely because they are naturally
occurring. Yet, secondary sulphates from vehicles, industry, waste burn-
ing and shipping may be reduced. Based on health risk of S, smoke from
open burning and road vehicles may together contribute to Suva's annual
mortality at a rate equivalent to the national road toll. The PMF determi-
nation of source contributions indicates PM in the Suva City area; waste-
burning contributions to PM2.5 are likely to be greater in residential areas.
Considering that Suva has waste collection services, emissions from open
burning of waste seem largely unnecessary and removal of this emission
source could potentially reduce annual mortality between 4 (based on
PM2.5 health risk) and 25 (based on sulphur health risk).
5. Summary & conclusions
The IBA and PMF techniques have been used to determine the source
contributions to Suva's PM2.5. Modelling of source factors, for the Suva
city site, shows that the majority of PM2.5 mass originates from human
activity; particularly combustion activities. A large proportion of PM2.5
mass originates from fossil fuel (diesel) smoke. Unlike natural emission
sources, such as sea aerosol, which cannot be reduced; by targeting fos-
sil fuel emissions and open burning, it is possible to reduce Suva's atmo-
spheric PM2.5 loadings. Considering the differential mortality risk of the
PM2.5 components BC and S, the greatest health beneﬁt in terms of re-
duced mortality would be gained by reducing fossil fuel smoke, vehicle
related emissions and smoke from open burning of wastes. Analysis of
epidemiological associations between Fijian health statistics and air
quality data are recommended to further understand the health risk of
air pollutants in the local context. Ongoing sampling is also recom-
mended in order to statistically improve the PMF analysis and to deter-
mine the effectiveness of emission reduction measures.

PM2.5 is considered the principal air pollutant caused by open biomass burning (OBB) in Mainland Southeast 
Asia (MSEA) and significant adverse health effects and economic burdens. The goals of this work are to conduct a 
literature review on relative measures of the effect associated with the exposure to OBB emission in MSEA, to 
analyze the impact of OBB emission on PM2.5 concentration in MSEA using the dispersion model, and to estimate 
the public health and economic impacts associated with the exposure to PM2.5 from OBB on regional and na­
tional scales using Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program during a smog episode. This work 
found that OBB was the largest emission source in MSEA, contributing 57% to the PM2.5 concentrations, with the 
substantial OBB impact was found in Northern Laos and Eastern Myanmar. As a result, the exposure to PM2.5 
from OBB was estimated to contribute a substantial number of deaths regarding all-cause (78,276 cases - 95% CI: 
62,915–92,629), respiratory disease (6,716 cases – 95% CI: 3,639–9,482), and cardiovascular disease (1,076 
cases – 95% CI: 490-1,615). The economic impact was estimated at 23.28 billion (95% CI: 18.69–27.57), 1.90 
billion (95% CI: 0.88–2.40), and 0.44 billion (95% CI: 0.20–0.67) USD, respectively. OBB emission caused the 
greatest public health and economic impact in Myanmar, while the smallest impact was found in Cambodia. Our 
study provides policymakers with quantitative estimates of the OBB impacts so that they can develop appropriate 
control measures at the regional and national levels in MSEA.   
1. Introduction 
Open biomass burning (OBB) is considered one of the most pre­
dominant sources of pollutants affecting air quality, especially in 
developing countries. OBB is the largest emission source of particulate 
matter (PM) during smog episodes in Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA), 
emitting particulate matter less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10) with the 
contribution of more than 70% to all emission sources in MSEA in March 
2012 (Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). OBB is not only a major source 
of PM but also criteria gas pollutants and heavy metals, such as carbon 
monoxide and mercury (Bich Thao et al., 2021; Vongmahadlek et al., 
2009). OBB consists of forest fires and agricultural burns (i.e., crop 
residue burning and land clearing) (Chen et al., 2017; Liang et al., 2020; 
Mousavi et al., 2019). Southeast Asia (SEA) region, especially MSEA, 
frequently has experienced severe air pollution from OBB in the dry 
season, especially in March (Cui et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2013; Pani 
et al., 2019; Pimonsree and Vongruang, 2018; Reddington et al., 2014; 
Thepnuan et al., 2019; Vongruang et al., 2017a; Yin et al., 2019). The 
main emission sources contributing to particulate matter less than 2.5 
μm in diameter (PM2.5) in MSEA are OBB, anthropogenic sources, and 
long-range transportation/local natural sources with a ratio of about 
48%, 27%, and 25%, respectively (Yin et al., 2019). Moreover, emissions

from OBB were found to be mainly responsible for PM2.5 concentrations 
in Thailand (Punsompong et al., 2021). During the period from 2011 to 
2021, the number of fire hotspots (FHSs) in March were recorded, and 
peaked at 120,140 hotspots in 2012, resulting in severe PM issues (e.g., 
with the highest PM10 24-h mean in Northern Thailand of 471 μg/m3). 
A modeling study in March 2012 found that emissions from OBB 
contributed 49% to PM10 concentrations in MSEA and the simulated 
PM10 24-h mean in MSEA exceeded 51% of the 2005 ambient air quality 
standards (AAQS) (i.e., 50 μg/m3) set by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) (Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). Among the monitoring data 
in Northern Thailand from 2012 to 2021 in March, the monthly average 
of observed PM10 concentration was highest in 2012 at 144 μg/m3, 
while that of 2017 was lowest at 84 μg/m3. Since 2019, PM2.5 con­
centrations have also been recorded at many monitoring sites in 
Northern Thailand. Observed PM2.5 data from 17 stations in March 
2020 show that the percentage of unhealthy days exceeding the 2021 
PM2.5 WHO AAQS (i.e., 15 μg/m3) were 100% at all stations. Moreover, 
the highest 24-h mean PM2.5 was 366 μg/m3, which was 24 times 
higher than the 2021 WHO AAQS. 
OBB emission do not only have detrimental impacts on local air 
quality but also on the international scale (J. Chen et al., 2017; Zheng 
et al., 2018). Many studies investigated potential emission sources of air 
pollution in major cities within MSEA using backward trajectories to 
determine the contribution of OBB to local air quality. Thepnuan et al. 
(2019) stated that smog events in 2016 were due to forest fires and 
agricultural burning from local areas and neighboring countries in the 
west and southwest of Chiang Mai. Punsompong et al. (2021) estimated 
the contribution of OBB emission to PM2.5 concentrations in Thailand in 
2016 to be 67% (the transboundary source) and 33% (the local source). 
Additionally, Dejchanchaiwong et al. (2020) found that the high PM2.5 
concentrations in Bangkok in 2019 could come from OBB in Northeast 
Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. As for modeling analysis, a 
study in March 2012 revealed that the contributions of OBB emission 
inside and outside Thailand to PM10 concentrations were 24% and 22%, 
respectively (Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). OBB is the major 
contributor to PM issues in the MSEA region, which has severe effects 
not only on local air quality but also at the regional level. Therefore, this 
study investigates the scope of the MSEA region. 
A handful of health impact assessment (HIA) studies indicated 
adverse impacts of PM2.5 attributable to OBB emission on human health 
and economic aspects. The correlation between exposure to OBB emis­
sion and chronic inflammatory lung diseases [asthma, chronic obstruc­
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung fibrosis, and lung cancer] is 
noteworthy (Falf´an-Valencia et al., 2020). Wegesser et al. (2009) found 
that the chemical composition of PM–derived wildfire is toxic to the 
lung, particularly to alveolar macrophages. In SEA, 110,000 annual 
mortalities were attributed to long-term exposure to fire emissions 
(Johnston Fay et al., 2012). In MSEA, Reddington et al. (2021) found 
that 27,500 [95% confidence interval (CI): 24,700–30,400] premature 
mortalities from 2003 to 2015 could be avoided if fire emissions were 
eliminated. Regarding Amazon fires in 2019, 4,966 (95% CI: 2,427–8, 
340) premature mortalities were estimated, accounting for 10% of 
Brazil’s annual PM2.5-related mortalities (Nawaz and Henze, 2020). 
During the same fire period, 3,400 (95% CI: 3,300–3,550) mortalities 
were quantified, and this number would have increased two times if this 
period had reached the highest record from 2003 to 2019 (Butt et al., 
2021). For short-term exposure to OBB emission, if the monthly mean 
PM2.5 change is 3.3 μg/m3, 171 cases of estimated all-cause (AC) 
mortality could be avoided in February 2018 in Northern South America 
(NSA) (Ballesteros-Gonz´alez et al., 2020). Several hundred AC mortality 
could be reduced by eliminating a prescribed in Pacific Northwest (PN) 
in America (Ravi et al., 2019). In terms of the economy, although the 
number of global wildfires is lower than that of earthquakes and floods, 
the global economic burden per person of wildfires is two and 48 times 
higher, respectively (Watts et al., 2019). 
Most HIA studies of OBB emission have used relative risks (RRs) 
associated with exposure to multiple emission sources. Similarly, the 
HIA studies in the MSEA region, which are summarized in Table A1 of 
the Appendix, generally derived RRs from overseas studies in the 
absence of appropriate relative measures of effect (RME). However, 
RME values from overseas studies can lead to high uncertainty in the 
assessment of health effects (Broome et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017a; de 
Oliveira Fernandes et al., 2020; Fold et al., 2020; Ha Chi and Kim Oanh, 
2021; D. Kim et al., 2019; Nordin et al., 2015). There is much scientific 
evidence regarding how severe OBB emission impacts human health. An 
assessment of the short-term health effects of exposure to OBB emission 
on a global scale found risks associated with AC, cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and respiratory morbidity (Karanasiou et al., 2021). During fire 
episodes, PM concentrations are significantly higher, including diverse 
air pollutants (Jaffe et al., 2020; Johnston et al., 2011; Linares et al., 
2015; Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). Although the time exposure to 
OBB emission is short, they are at a higher risk of inhaling the much 
higher PM concentrations during the smog episodes, leading to greater 
public health impacts. Exposure to OBB emission is more deleterious to 
populations in rural areas, where air conditioning and airtight housing 
styles are not common, than to populations in urban areas (Jaffe et al., 
2020; Pothirat et al., 2019a). However, urban populations, particularly 
outdoor workers, may also be at higher risks either, it is because the 
exposure is not only from urban emission sources but also from trans­
boundary transport of OBB emission. Punsompong et al. (2021) found a 
high contribution of OBB from the Northeastern region of Thailand and 
Cambodia to PM2.5 concentrations in Bangkok. Severe fire events emit 
particles to a higher plume height, thereby getting transported to longer 
downwind regions, and resulting in larger exposure (Koplitz et al., 
2016). Wegesser et al. (2009) stated that PM from fires is more toxic 
than PM from urban emission sources. PM2.5 from wildfires is about 10 
times more detrimental to human health, especially to the respiratory 
system, than PM2.5 from other emission sources (Aguilera et al., 2021). 
On the other hand, Rahman et al. (2021a, 2021b) found that the asso­
ciations of PM2.5-derived fossil fuel and CVD and respiratory diseases 
are stronger than that of PM2.5-derived OBB in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, 
which is mainly explained by the oxidative stress and its related 
inflammation. Seagrave et al. (2006) apportioned PM2.5 mass into 
wood burning, diesel and gasoline emissions and found that the most 
toxicity was from vehicles and industry. Generally, the current 
source-apportioned PM2.5 studies on health effects of OBB and other 
emission sources are inconsistent. It could be explained by the hetero­
geneity of PM contribution and interactions with various climate vari­
ables across regions (Berger et al., 2018). Therefore, OBB 
emission-based HIA studies should select the appropriate RME values 
considering factors of emission sources and geographical locations. 
There is much literature supporting the substantial contribution of 
OBB emission to PM in MSEA. PM2.5 is considered the most detrimental 
air pollutant to global health. This issue urgently requires regional 
cooperation to address it effectively and has attracted considerable 
public attention in MSEA. Quantitative data is needed to design feasible 
control measures. To our knowledge, however, quantitative estimates of 
public health and associated economic impacts from short-term expo­
sure during the worst smog episode in this region have not yet been 
revealed for OBB with the appropriate use of source-specific RME 
values. Moreover, although the number of epidemiological studies 
related to OBB emission in the MSEA has been increasing recently, the 
synthesized knowledge based on health risks from OBB exposure in this 
region is limited. Therefore, first, this study aimed to summarize and 
review epidemiological studies related to RME and the exposure to OBB 
emission in the MSEA, to identify important research gaps and select the 
most appropriate study for our assessment. Second, the impact of OBB 
on ambient PM2.5 concentrations in the peak haze episode was 
analyzed. Third, the public health impact attributable to short-term 
exposure to OBB emission was quantitatively estimated. Fourth, the 
associated economic impact was also quantitatively evaluated. Mortality 
of acute diseases related to air pollution was considered in this work: 
N.N. Linh Thao et al.

respiratory, CVD, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and COPD, together with 
AC mortality. It is noted that the term OBB emission in this work in­
cludes only OBB. 
2. Methodology 
This work investigates public health and economic impact of PM2.5 
from OBB over MSEA using BenMAP in the regional and national scale. 
Health impact assessment requires appropriate health risk data related 
to PM2.5-derived OBB. Therefore, the first step is to review the epide­
miological studies on RME in MSEA concerning OBB and to select the 
most appropriate study for our work. The second step is to quantify the 
impact of OBB emission on ambient PM2.5 concentrations using a 
dispersion model. Third, the public health impact of five health end­
points (AC, respiratory, CVD, IHD, and COPD mortality) attributable to 
exposure to PM2.5-derived OBB emission were estimated. Fourth, the 
associated economic impact was evaluated. Both genders (male and 
female) with all age groups and people who aged from 18 years (18UP) 
were considered. According to the International Classification of Dis­
ease, Revision 10, the mortality codes of the three health endpoints in 
this work were A00-R99 (non-accidental causes), J00-J98 (respiratory 
disease), I00–I99 (CVD), I50.9 (IHD), and J44.9 (COPD) (ICD-10, 2011). 
2.1. Literature review on relative measures 
Among the epidemiological studies, our study focused on the RME 
values used to calculate the concentration-response function (CRF) in 
the HIA. In epidemiological studies of air pollution, RR, incidence rate 
ratio (IRR), and odds ratio (OR) are relative terms used for assessing the 
association between exposure to air pollutants and human health effects. 
In general, RME values attributable to exposure to air pollution are 
divided into two different types of studies, including cohort studies 
(long-term exposure) and time series studies (short-term exposure). 
RME values differ by various factors such as air pollutants, predominant 
emission sources, exposure time, health endpoints, population, socio­
economic status, and climatic characteristics in the area of interest. 
Online database searches were conducted on PubMed, Google 
Scholar, Web of Science, and Thai Citation Index library platforms using 
the following keywords and their acronyms: health effects, air pollution, 
open biomass burning, fire event, vegetation fire, short-term exposure, 
time-series study, epidemiological study, health burden, mortality, 
morbidity, hospital admission, hospital visits, relative risk, odds ratio, 
risk ratio, hazard ratio, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam. 
The searches were limited to the period from 2016 to 2021 and the 
English language. 
2.2. Estimating the impact of OBB emission on ambient PM2.5 
concentrations 
To estimate the impact of OBB on PM2.5 concentrations during the 
smog episode, two simulations of PM2.5 concentrations were conduct­
ed. In the first simulation (the baseline scenario), PM2.5 concentrations 
(100% fire) were simulated by inputting all emission sources, including 
OBB, industrial, traffic, residential, and biogenic sources. In the second 
simulation (the control scenario), emissions from OBB were eliminated 
while the other emission sources (industrial, traffic, residential, and 
biogenic sources) were retained. PM2.5 concentrations were inputted 
into Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program (BenMAP) 
in a grid format. 
Daily mean PM2.5 concentrations were simulated using the Weather 
Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)-Community Multiscale Air 
Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) with a grid resolution of 27 × 27 km2 
in our previous study (Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). In 2012, there 
were few PM2.5 monitoring stations in the MSEA region. There were 3 
PM2.5 measurements in Thailand, that only one station was in the 
source region of OBB in Chiang Mai province, Northern Thailand. 
Moreover, our simulated PM2.5 concentrations were also compared 
with downwind area at the Tap Mun station in Hong Kong (Hagler et al., 
2006). The model performance statistics of MFB and MFE of PM2.5 
concentrations were 0.49 and 0.74, respectively that meet the US EPA 
criteria (US EPA, 2007). The simulated PM2.5 and observed PM2.5 were 
comparable, with an average value of 71 μg/m3 and 43 μg/m3, respec­
tively. The simulated daily PM2.5 variation corresponds well with the 
observations, with the correlation coefficient of 0.74. However, the 
overestimates were found at Chiangmai station, where was in intensified 
OBB. This may be due to the uncertainty in OBB emission that is one of 
the most uncertainty emissions, and challenge for emission estimation 
and ambient concentration simulation. Many studies have found sig­
nificant uncertainties in OBB emissions (Chuang et al., 2015; Fu et al., 
2012; Huang et al., 2013; Pimonsree et al., 2018). According to Huang 
et al. (2013), CO simulation in northern Thailand were 2.6–2.3 times 
higher than observations. On the other hand, PM10 simulation in MSEA 
from 2006 to 2010 is underestimated in north MSEA, south MSEA, and 
east Asia with NMB values of - 20.98 to - 37.04, - 44.32 to - 53.83, and - 
47.64 to - 59.49, respectively (Dong and Fu, 2015). This study minimizes 
the uncertainty in OBB emission by modifying its emission in modeling 
system with fire radiative power that the method was developed by our 
laboratory (Pimonsree et al., 2018). According to limitation of a few 
PM2.5 monitoring stations in MSEA during 2012, the evaluations of PM10 
and aerosol optical depth (AOD) were also considered. Most of PM10 in 
dense OBB areas in Northern Thailand consist of fine particle with 
PM2.5/PM10 ratio of 0.64 for observations and 0.62 for simulations. 
Additionally, high correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 with more than 
0.9 in both observation and simulation datasets. Simulated PM10 con­
centrations were compared to observations from 21 stations of the 
Thailand Pollution Control Department and four stations of the Hong 
Kong Environmental Protection Department. The evaluation results 
show good agreement between the simulated concentrations and ob­
servations (Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). The average simulated 
and observed PM10 were 107 μg/m3 and 100 μg/m3, respectively. The 
model performance statistics of MFB and MFE of PM10 concentrations 
meet the performance criteria (Boylan and Russell, 2006). The AOD data 
level 2 observed at 550 nm using the ground-based Sun Photometer from 
AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) was applied for evaluation with 
14 AOD sites, including four sites in Vietnam, five sites in Thailand, two 
sites in Laos, and one site per country in China, Myanmar, and Malaysia. 
The simulated AOD and ground-based AOD measurements were com­
parable, with an average value of 0.73 and 0.91, respectively. Addi­
tionally, the simulated AOD was also compared with the AOD from 
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), an instru­
ment on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The simulated AOD and MODIS 
AOD were close to the average value of 0.45 and 0.40, respectively and

their spatial distributions were similar. However, the evaluation showed 
some underestimation in the south of MSEA, especially in the marine 
region, which is related to the lack of some emission types in the 
modeling system, including sea salt and ship emissions (Vongruang and 
Pimonsree, 2020). In addition, there are no observations of secondary 
PM for model evaluation during study period. The modeling system 
should be evaluation simulated PM2.5 with more observation sites and 
with observed secondary PM2.5 in future work. In general, the model 
performed well and was able to capture most of the spatial and temporal 
variations of observed aerosol in MSEA (Pimonsree et al., 2018; 
Pimonsree and Vongruang, 2018; Vongruang et al., 2017; Vongruang 
and Pimonsree, 2020). 
2.3. Estimating public health impacts 
Among the tools for assessing the impact of air pollution on public 
health and the economy, BenMAP was chosen in this work due to its 
flexible performance on different datasets, as well as full-scale benefits 
appraisal. It is a computer-based program that requires input data (air 
quality baseline and control, population, and baseline incidence rate) in 
a grid format and the CRF. This study investigated with a grid resolution 
of 27 × 27 km2. BenMAP produces detailed results in spatial and tem­
poral terms with 95% CIs that can be exported to Geographic Informa­
tion System (GIS) maps. This feature allows users to conveniently 
analyze the spatial results. The public health impacts attributable to 
PM2.5-derived OBB on five health endpoints (AC, CVD, respiratory, 
IHD, and COPD mortalities) were calculated in BenMAP using input 
factors as seen in the log-linear health effect function of equation (1), 
Δy = monthly y0 × [1 −(1 / exp(β × ΔPM)] × Pop
(1)  
where Δy is the number of mortality cases due to the exposure to 
PM2.5—derived from OBB (cases/month); monthly baseline incidence 
rate (Y0) (daily Y0 multiplied by 31) is the baseline incidence rate for 
each health endpoint (person/month); β is the CRF, derived from 
epidemiological studies; ΔPM is the quantitative indication of the OBB 
impact on ambient PM2.5 concentrations (μg/m3); Pop represents the 
number of exposed populations living in the study area (person). 
2.3.1. Calculating the CRF 
The CRF can be derived from the hazard ratio, RR, or OR, where RRs 
were used in this study, and converted to CRFs and their standard error 
(SE) by equations (2a) & (2b), 
β = ln(RR) / Δpollution
(2a)  
SE = {[ln(UCL) / Δpollution] −[ln(LCL) / Δpollution]} / (2 × 1.96)
(2b)  
where β is the CRF; RR is the relative risk; SE is the standard error; UCL is 
the upper confidence limit; LCL is the lower confidence limit; Δ pollution 
is set at 10 μg/m3 following the selected epidemiological study. 
RR is a probability of a health event occurring in an exposed group 
versus the probability of the health event occurring in an unexposed 
group. If the RR is equal to 1.0, it means that the risk is identical in both 
groups. If the RR is greater than 1.0, it means an increase in risk (or 
adverse health effect) in the numerator for the exposed group. If the RR 
is less than 1.0, it indicates a decrease in risk (or a positive health effect) 
for the exposed group. In terms of air pollutant exposure, the RR illus­
trates the association between an increase in the concentration of a 
specific air pollutant and adverse health effects (morbidity and mortality 
of different health endpoints, such as AC, CVD, IHD, COPD, lung cancer, 
etc.). The most ideal RRs for this work were selected from the literature 
review, characterized by short-term exposure to specific PM2.5-derived 
OBB emission, within the location with a tropical climate and a popu­
lation living in the MSEA. 
2.3.2. Baseline incidence rate 
In this work, the baseline incidence rate (Y0) is the probability that 
an inhabitant of a country will die within a given time period. Sets of Y0 
for each health endpoint in 2012, categorized by male, female with five- 
year age groups in each country, were obtained from the Global Burdens 
of Disease (Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, 2018). 
Five-year age groups cover from age 18 to beyond age 80 in Myanmar, 
Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. However, the age categories in Laos 
range from 0 to over 75 years, following the government’s classification 
to simplify the population projection for Laos. For AC mortality, only 
natural causes were included. To be compatible with short-term expo­
sure, daily Y0 values (person per day) were estimated by dividing by 366 
days and inputted into BenMAP. In Fig. A.1, Y0 of AC mortality is 
highest, followed by IHD and COPD mortality regarding the population 
of 18UP. The daily Y0 values of AC mortality (0.000078) and IHD 
mortality (0.000010) are highest in Cambodia, followed by Laos with 
0.000076 and 0.000009, respectively. However, the highest daily Y0 of 
COPD mortality is found in Myanmar with 0.0000086, while that of 
Thailand is lowest with 0.0000023. Regarding the differences in age 
configurations, the three health endpoints show a similar pattern, which 
is significantly high in the elderly group. The figures of Y0 for each 
health endpoint by country are shown in Fig. A.1 of the Appendix. 
Similarly, in Fig. A.2, regarding the all-age population, the daily Y0 
values of AC mortality (0.000314) and CVD mortality (0.0000287) are 
highest in Laos, and respiratory mortality (0.000033) is greatest in 
Myanmar. Among five countries, the daily Y0 values of three health 
endpoints are lowest in Thailand with AC mortality (0.000062), CVD 
mortality (0.0000079) and respiratory mortality (0.000006). However, 
in Fig. A.3, the age configurations of all-age population are significantly 
high in the children group for AC and CVD mortality. The daily Y0 values 
of respiratory mortality share the same pattern, except for those of 
Vietnam and Thailand, which are remarkable in elderly groups. 
2.3.3. Population projection 
BenMAP requires population data in a grid format to calculate each 
specific area. These were taken from Gridded Population of the World 
(GPW), version 4 (Center For International Earth Science Information 
Network-CIESIN-Columbia University, 2018). However, the population 
data from GPW were estimated for every five-year interval from 2000 to 
2020. As a result, the population data in 2012 (1 × 1 km2) were pro­
jected from the dataset in 2010, following the GPW procedure. Ac­
cording to the GPW method, the estimated population is adjusted by the 
United Nations World Population Prospects. In this work, however, the 
adjustment factor was calculated using the most recent government 
census data in each country to increase the reliability of our projections 
for 2012. Of the five countries, the highest number of populations is 
found in Vietnam, followed by Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and 
Laos. Regarding age categories, the MSEA populations are young soci­
eties, in which people aged from 20 to 24 are dominant in this region, 
except the Thai population. The geographical distribution of the MSEA 
population is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
2.4. Quantifying economic impact 
After estimating the mortality per health endpoint, these results were 
multiplied by Value per Statistical Life (VSL) to derive the associated 
economic impacts. BenMAP-based studies from other countries, notably 
the US and China, have used Cost of illness (COI) or Willingness to pay 
(WTP) values. However, COI and WTP values have not been well- 
investigated in MSEA regions, particularly for PM2.5-based works. 
Therefore, this study used base VSL values derived from aggregating 
individuals’ WTP values for a marginal reduction in risk of premature 
mortality. 
The VSL, 3 million USD, was taken from the OCED report in the unit 
of USD 2005 (Roy and Braathen, 2017). However, the base VSL is not 
available in the MSEA region. Therefore, the benefit transfer method 
N.N. Linh Thao et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Atmospheric Pollution Research 13 (2022) 101418
5
was applied to calculate country-specific VSL values. The benefit 
transfer method refers to the valuation method based on the available 
empirical research. It was used to transfer the economic value of the 
study site (where the WTP surveys were implemented) to the study sites 
of other studies (where base VSL is not available) (Zhou et al., 2020). 
Country-specific values were calculated according to equation (4), 
VSLC,2012 = VSLOECD,2005 × (YC/YOECD)β
′
× (1 + %ΔP + %ΔY)β
′
(4)  
where VSLOECD,2005 is the base VSL value of OECD countries, 3 million 
USD 2005; Y is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita at the Pur­
chasing Power Parity (PPP), in 2012; C represents country being esti­
mated; % ΔP is the percentage increase in consumer price index (CPI) 
from 2005 to 2012; % ΔY is the percentage change in real GDP per 
capita growth from 2005 to 2012, which is derived from the annual 
growth in real GDP per capita; and β
′ is the income elasticity of VSL, 
which measures the percentage increase in VSL for the percentage in­
crease in income, with a mean of 1.2, ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 for low and 
middle-income countries, according to OECD data (Roy and Braathen, 
2017). These economic indicators were taken from the databank of 
World Development Indicators, World Bank (World Development In­
dicators). Extracted and calculated values are provided in Table A2 of 
the Appendix. Besides, the economic indicators in eq. (4) of Thailand, 
especially GDP, are significantly higher compared to other countries. 
Therefore, Thailand’s country-specific base VSL (1,140,844 USD) is 
largest in MSEA region, followed by Vietnam (362,455 USD) and Laos 
(310,139 USD). The differences in country-specific VSLs among MSEA 
countries are shown in Fig. 2. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Literature review on RME associated with the exposure to OBB 
emission in the MSEA region 
Seven research articles were found in the MSEA region, following 
listed keywords. All of these studies were conducted in Thailand. 
Mueller et al. (2020) and Uttajug et al. (2021) examined the relationship 
between exposure to OBB emission and health risks in Northern 
Thailand provinces. On the scale of provinces, four studies are focusing 
on the Chiang Mai population (Pothirat et al., 2016, 2019a, 2019b; 
Vajanapoom et al., 2020). Moreover, there is a study conducted in Tak, 
Thailand (Laithaisong and Tultrairatana, 2020). In general, Northern 
Thailand, especially Chiang Mai province, was usually chosen to 
investigate epidemiological studies on OBB emission because of being 
acutely affected by severe OBB emission annually. However, it is 
necessary to investigate studies in other areas that are severely affected 
by OBB emission in Thailand, as well as in other countries in the MSEA 
region. This is mainly because the chemical compositions of different 
OBB types may result in distinguished adverse effects on human health 
(Johnston et al., 2019). 
Among the pollutants studied, the focus is mainly on PM10 because 
monitoring stations measuring PM10 concentrations are more wide­
spread in Thailand before 2018. There is only one study investigating 
the mortality risks of AC, COPD, CAD, sepsis due to the exposure to both 
air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10) in the Chiang Mai population (Pothirat 
et al., 2019a). Moreover, another PM2.5-based study was conducted in 
Tak, Thailand (Laithaisong and Tultrairatana, 2020). Regarding the

target population of the seven studies, the age groups are diverse. 
Uttajug et al. (2021) investigated the effects of vegetation fires and 
hospital visits, focusing on groups of children under 15 years of age in 
eight provinces in Northern Thailand (Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Phayao, 
Nan, Phrae, Lampang, Lamphun, and Mae Hong Son). Laithaisong and 
Tultrairatana (2020) focused not only on the group of children (under 15 
years old) but on all age groups. Pothirat et al. (2016) separated two 
different age groups compatible with distinguished health endpoints, in 
which people aged above 40 were a target group of COPD-based daily 
emergency visits and people aged above 15 were focused on asthma 
disease. Moreover, those over 18 years of age were interested in 
exploring the association between PMs exposure and AC mortality and 
causes of death in the population of Chiang Mai (Pothirat et al., 2019a). 
Moreover, Pothirat et al. (2019b) and Vajanapoom et al. (2020) were 
interested in all age groups in their studies, however, the target popu­
lation in the study of Pothirat et al. (2019b) is more specific than the 
other studies, including patients in Chiang Dao hospital and citizens 
living in Chiang Dao district, Chiang Mai province. Mueller et al. (2020) 
divided the population into two sub-age groups (below and above 65) to 
examine the RR values of COPD, IHD, and cerebrovascular hospital visits 
attributable to PM10 exposure. 
Generally, significant RME values are observed at lag 0 to lag 3. 
Uttajug et al. (2021) found that OR = 1.01 (95% CIs: 1.00–1.02) when a 
10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 concentrations on a smog day associated 
with respiratory disease-related hospital visits of children aged below 
15 at lag 0. In the same age group in the Tak population, Laithaisong and 
Tultrairatana (2020) found a significant association between a 10 μg/m3 
increase in PM2.5 concentrations and asthma visits at lag 0 [OR = 1.022 
(1.002–1.042)]. This study also reported OR by all age groups [OR =
1.012 (1.000–1.024)] and by gender [Male-OR = 1.016 (1.001–1.031)]. 
Vajanapoom et al. (2020) found that the highest excess risk (ER) for 
all-cause mortality was 3.01% (95% CI: 1.49–4.55) for an increase in the 
interquartile range (IQR) of PM10 concentrations at lag 0–1. The inci­
dence rate ratio (IRR) for same-day PM10 exposure per 10 μg/m3 of 
individuals under 65 years of age, IRR = 1.021 (95% CI: 1.011–1.032), is 
higher than that of over 65 years of age with respect to chronic lower 
respiratory disease (Mueller et al., 2020). However, there are studies in 
the Chiang Mai population, showing a significant lag of day 6 and day 7. 
Pothirat et al. (2016) found that regarding emergency visits, the stron­
gest acute effect for asthma attacks was in a cumulative lag day of day 6 
with an adjusted RR = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.001–1.040), while the strongest 
acute effect for COPD was a cumulative lag day of day 7 with an adjusted 
RR = 1.030 (95% CI: 1.010–1.050). For both diseases, the significant RR 
was 1.030 (95% CI: 1.010–1.040) at a cumulative lag day of day 7. From 
2016 to 2017, Pothirat et al. (2019b) also found a positive association 
between the exposure to PM (PM10 and PM2.5) and daily mortality of 
Chiang Dao community dwellers with the significant RRs at lag 7 [1.030 
(95% CI: 1.004–1.056) and 1.040 (95% CI: 1.006–1.074)], respectively. 
Regarding hospitalized patients, however, only PM2.5 was associated 
with daily mortality at lag 6 [RR = 1.153 (95% CI: 1.001–1.329)]. From 
2016 to 2018, Pothirat et al. (2019a) conducted the time series analysis 
in Chiang Mai and indicated that the significant RRs of AC mortality due 
to the exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was 1.018 (95% CI: 1.008–1.029) 
and 1.016 (95% CI: 1.001–1.032), respectively. The association between 
the exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and COPD mortality was significantly 
at lag 6, 1.069 (95% CI: 1.017–1.123) and 1.089 (95% CI: 1.016–1.067), 
in the order given. However, that of asthma and community-acquired 
pneumonia mortality were not statistically significant. A longer lag 
was observed in the population of Chiang Mai, which can be explained 
by the behavior of the population. It takes a longer time for the symp­
toms to become serious enough to visit a hospital because of the sensi­
tivity and less severity in the population (Pothirat et al., 2016). To put 
health risks from OBB exposure in the MSEA region into context, we 
compare with values from the global systematic review and 
meta-analyses study (Karanasiou et al., 2021). Generally, RME values 
from OBB emission in the MSEA region are comparable to other regions. 
Regarding health endpoints, morbidity (hospital visits and emer­
gency visits) is mostly focused among seven studies, while mortality is 
examined in recently published studies. Prominent diseases related to 
air pollution are considered, such as AC, CVD, respiratory, and their 
associated specific causes of mortality or morbidity. In general, AC and 
respiratory diseases are most commonly investigated in seven studies, 
which are acute health effects attributable to short-term exposure to air 
pollution. 
To sum up, almost all epidemiological studies on exposure to OBB 
emission were found in Thailand, especially in Northern Thailand. The 
number of epidemiological studies derived from OBB exposure is limited 
in other dense FHS locations within the MSEA region. Specific air pol­
lutants (i.e., PM2.5, PM1, O3), different age groups, and genders should 
be further investigated. Cohort studies, mortality endpoint of diseases, 
particularly the comparison of health risks between non-burning and 
burning days in the same population at different exposure levels should 
also be focused on to provide comprehensive knowledge on health risks 
from OBB exposure in this region. Although the population of the MSEA 
region has similar cultures, body, and nutritional characteristics, it is 
necessary to conduct studies in other MSEA countries to examine the 
behaviors of the exposed population that may be different health care 
and affect the lag time of risk estimation (Pothirat et al., 2019a; 2019b). 
The summary table of studies included in this literature review is 
attached (Table A.3). As a result of this literature review, as well as the 
compatibility of the research context in epidemiological studies and our 
work, as mentioned in the Methodology section, the RRs in the popu­
lation of Chiang Mai of AC, COPD, and IHD mortality were 1.016 (95% 
CI: 1.001–1.032), 1.089 (95% CI: 1.016–1.167), and 1.086 (95% CI: 
1.002–1.177), respectively, being selected to estimate the public health 
impacts of PM2.5 from OBB emission in the MSEA region (Pothirat et al., 
2019b). This study is based on observed PM2.5 in Chiang Mai, where is 
considered as an ideal representative for being significantly impacted 
from OBB emission in MSEA. It is located in high OBB areas. Moreover, 
there are many scientific evidences showing that OBB emission is a 
major emission source in Chiang Mai as well as other provinces in upper 
Northern Thailand (Chantara et al., 2012; Kim Oanh and Leelasakultum, 
2011). To be more specific, the high correlation between PM2.5 and K 
concentration (a main tracer of OBB emission) was found, with 0.814 
and 0.641 in Doi Angkhang (DAK) station and Chiang Mai University 
(CMU) station, respectively (Khamkaew et al., n.d.). Similarly, Pun­
sompong and Chantara (2018) also found that in March and April, K+
accounted for 49–50% of total elements. The K+ concentration and 
levoglucosan were significantly correlated, with r = 0.7 and 0.5 for DAK 
and CMU sampling sites, respectively. The emission inventories of 
argo-industry and forest fire highly correlated to the monthly ambient 
PM concentration in Thailand (Phairuang et al., 2017). 
However, current epidemiological studies on exposure to OBB 
emission in the MSEA region only focus on PM2.5 mass within locations 
with OBB as a major emission source, or during haze periods. This 
limitation could imply unclear health effects from specific OBB emis­
sion. There are studies about the relationship between specific PM2.5- 
derived OBB emission and health risks in other regions and global 
scale (Berger et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2021; Ito et al., 2006; Karanasiou 
et al., 2021; Mar et al., 2006; Park et al., 2014; Rahman et al., 2021a; 
Thurston et al., 2016). Therefore, to have the specific HIA attributable to 
the exposure to PM2.5-derived OBB emission, this work applied another 
dataset of RME values deriving from wildfire-based PM2.5 in the SEA 
region of AC mortality (1.017–95% CI: 1.013–1.020), CVD mortality 
(1.011–95% CI: 1.005–1.017) and respiratory mortality (1.016–95% CI: 
1.008–1.023) (Chen et al., 2021). This work is based on simulated 
PM2.5 concentrations from wildfire using the chemical transport model 
at a 0⋅25◦× 0⋅25◦resolution.

3.2. Impact of OBB on PM2.5 concentrations in the MSEA region during 
the smog episode 
Fig. 3 illustrates the area average of simulated PM2.5 concentrations 
over MSEA from all emission sources and without OBB. During the smog 
episode in March 2012, air quality in the MSEA region was polluted, 
with an area average PM2.5 concentration of 79 ± 62 μg/m3. The daily 
variation of PM2.5 concentrations, which includes all emission sources, 
was highly fluctuated. It increased from the 15th day, corresponding to 
the increase in the number of FHS count, and reached a peak value (122 
μg/m3) on the 27th day because of the substantial contribution from 
OBB emission of more than 60%. 
Moreover, the impact of OBB emission on PM2.5 concentrations 
during the smog episode was investigated. The daily PM2.5 concentra­
tions were significantly affected by the emissions from OBB, with the 
average contribution of OBB emission to the overall PM2.5 concentra­
tions in the MSEA region being 57%, with a range of 20%–76%. The 
impact of OBB on PM2.5 is a little higher than that on PM10 in MSEA 
(49%) in a previous study (Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). As shown 
in Fig. 3, OBB had a substantial impact on the overall PM2.5 concen­
trations, exceeding 50% on 20 days in March 2012. Additionally, PM2.5 
concentrations changed mainly corresponding well with the number of 
FHS counts in MSEA. Therefore, OBB in MSEA is the main contributor to 
31 unhealthy days with 24-h PM2.5 concentrations above the 2021 
WHO AAQS (i.e., 15 μg/m3). 
At the national level, the results showed that emissions from OBB 
accounted for the largest share of the PM2.5 concentrations with 
approximately 70% in Laos, followed by Myanmar (69%), Cambodia 
(54%), Thailand (47%), and Vietnam (31%). As shown in Fig. 4A, the 
areas with high PM2.5 concentrations due to emissions from OBB are 
located in Northeast and Southeast Myanmar, the North of Thailand, 
Northwest Laos, and Northwest Vietnam. These areas are consistent 
with the geographical distribution of high fire hotspot density (FHSD). 
Therefore, these particular regions should be prioritized to address OBB 
emission issues. 
Additionally, PM2.5 concentrations derived from OBB emission were 
substantially high in the border areas between Thailand and Myanmar in 
March. This could be due to heavy OBB (Fig. 4D) and transboundary 
pollution. This finding is confirmed by Punsompong et al. (2021), in 
which the North of Thailand was received more than 50% of the air mass 
from OBB emission via southwesterly winds in 2016. Punsompong et al. 
(2021) also indicated that forest fires were a predominant OBB emission 
source contributing to the high PM2.5 concentrations in the North of 
Thailand. Moreover, Vongruang and Pimonsree (2020) quantitatively 
investigated the impact of OBB emission on PM10 concentrations in 
Thailand. The result showed that OBB from neighboring countries 
contributes significantly to 22% of PM10 concentrations in Thailand, 
while the contribution of all OBB (inside and outside Thailand) is 46%. 
Hence, transboundary pollution from OBB emission is a regional issue 
that requires cooperation among five countries to develop feasible 
control measures. 
The FHS density at the level of the whole country area and only the 
areas with significant OBB impacts (PM2.5 increase greater than or 
equal to 50 μg/m3 by OBB) was examined (Fig. 5). OBB impacts on air 
quality are scattered widely in Myanmar, where areas with significant 
PM2.5 changes due to OBB accounting for more than 70% of the total 
area of Myanmar (483,593 km2). These are the reasons why OBB had the 
greatest impact on air quality in Myanmar, followed by Laos, which 
accounted for 48% of Laos’s total area (111,568 km2). In contrast, the 
FHSD in both mentioned scales in Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia 
shows large differences, more than four times. This means that emissions 
from OBB had significant impacts on PM2.5 at smaller scales (Northern 
Thailand, Northwest Vietnam, and Northeast Cambodia), where grids 
with the significant change in PM2.5 accounted for only 20% (100,369 
km2), 8% (25,641 km2), and 5% (9717 km2) of the total area per 
country, respectively. 
3.3. Mortality due to PM2.5 from OBB emission 
Mortality due to PM2.5 exposure from OBB emission was estimated 
and shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6. Regarding the RR from Pothirat et al. 
(2019b) in case of 18UP population, overall, the MSEA region’s health 
burden-based AC mortality was estimated to be highest (5,076 cases – 
95% CI: 199-9,755), followed by IHD mortality (2,388 cases – 95% CI: 
69-3,835), and COPD mortality (1,634 cases – 95% CI: 412-2,428). 
When compared with the data on natural mortality in each country, 
except for injuries, OBB emission was estimated to contribute the 
highest percentage to total natural deaths in Myanmar (0.78%) in 2012, 
followed by Laos (0.76%), Thailand (0.29%), Cambodia (0.21%), and 
Vietnam (0.07%). Moreover, IHD mortality attributable to PM2.5 
exposure was estimated to contribute to 3.83% of total natural deaths in 
Myanmar in 2012, followed by 1.36% in Thailand. Deaths in Laos, 
Vietnam, and Cambodia were estimated to account for relatively small 
percentages of recorded natural mortalities per country with 0.97%, 
0.42%, and 0.36%, respectively. 4.15%, 2.92%, 1.47%, 1.12%, and 
0.46% of natural mortalities due to COPD in 2012 in Myanmar, Laos, 
Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, in the order given, are attributable to 
air pollution caused by PM2.5-based OBB emission during the smog 
episode. On the other hand, in the context of all-age population using 
source-specific RRs derived from OBB emission in SEA region from Chen 
et al. (2021), AC mortality was estimated to be greatest (78,276 cases – 
95% CI: 62,915–92,629), followed by respiratory mortality (6,716 cases 
– 95% CI: 3,639–9,482) and CVD mortality (1,076 cases – 95% CI: 
490-1,615). In the comparison with the records of natural deaths in each 
country, OBB was estimated to contribute the largest percentage to total 
natural deaths in Laos (27.37%), followed by Myanmar (13.98%), 
Cambodia (3.87%), Thailand (1.02%) and Vietnam (0.67%). Besides, 
respiratory mortality was estimated to account for 2.19% and 1.24% of 
total natural deaths in Laos and Myanmar, respectively. However, small 
shares were found in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam with 0.52%, 
0.07% and 0.02%, in the order given. The contribution of estimated CVD 
mortality attributable to OBB was found to be less than 1% in MSEA 
countries with 0.27% (Laos), Myanmar (0.16%), Thailand (0.05%), 
Cambodia (0.05%), and Vietnam (0.02%), accordingly. 
Among MSEA countries, there are large spatial variations of esti­
mated health burdens as shown in Fig. 6, which can be explained by 
three main factors: (1) The variations in the impact of OBB emission on 
air quality; (2) The spatial distribution of the population; and (3) The 
baseline incidence rates in each area. The great health burdens were 
found in densely populated areas, which can be clearly seen in major 
cities, in the central region and south of Myanmar, northwest of Laos, 
two major cities in the north and central region of Thailand (Bangkok 
and surrounding areas), southeast of Cambodia (Phnom Penh), and Red

River Delta in the north and south of Vietnam (Fig. 1). This result is 
consistent with previous studies (Andre˜ao et al., 2018; L. Chen et al., 
2017b; Ding et al., 2016; Ha Chi and Kim Oanh, 2021; Koplitz et al., 
2017; Punsompong et al., 2021; Ravi et al., 2019). Although the OBB 
impact on PM2.5 concentrations is lower in Myanmar than that in Laos, 
the estimated health burden in Myanmar is highest in the MSEA region 
for all three health endpoints. This could be due to the high Y0 values 
and the number of population, as shown in Fig. A.1, Fig. A2 and Fig. 1, 
respectively. Furthermore, though emissions from OBB affected air 
quality more in Laos than in Vietnam and Thailand, the severity of 
estimated health burdens was reversed. This is because the number of 
exposed populations in Thailand and Vietnam exceeds that of Laos, as 
shown in Fig. 1. 
Among target diseases, the dataset from Pothirat et al. (2019b) 
considers 18UP population, while that of Chen et al. (2021) covers the 
all-age population. Therefore, the estimated health burden of all-age 
group is significantly higher than that of 18UP population. This 
discrimination is caused by the variation in the magnitude of three pa­
rameters (RR values, the number of population and associated Y0). First, 
the RR value of Chen et al. (2021) is higher than that of Pothirat et al. 
(2019b) with 5.84%. The influence of different RR values on the HIA 
estimation was examined. The results show that when AC mortality 
-based RR value is increased, the estimated health burden results in­
crease of 5.20%. Second, the number of population and the age group 
structure in MSEA countries also lead to this discrimination. To be more 
specific, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam are young societies, in 
which the large number of populations is mainly distributed in young 
age groups (from age 0 to age 19), except for Thai population as shown 
in Fig. A4. The great number of Thai population is found mainly in the 
adult groups (from age 25 to age 49). Third, this discrimination is also 
well-explained by the associated Y0 of AC mortality, in which among age 
groups, the highest values are found in the age group of 0–4 in all MSEA 
countries. The variations by age groups of the number of population and 
Y0 of AC mortality are shown in Fig. A3 and Fig. A4. 
To determine the risk of OBB to human health in each area, the 
health risk rates per 100,000 population were estimated and shown in 
Table A.4 and Fig. 7. The analysis found that the rates of health risk 
attributable to PM2.5-derived OBB in MSEA countries are relatively

different from the mortality. The highest rate was found in Laos, fol­
lowed by Myanmar in both RR datasets. However, regarding the dataset 
of Pothirat et al. (2019b), the health risk rate of Myanmar is moderately 
higher for COPD. It is mainly because the COPD baseline incidence rate 
in Myanmar is higher than that in Laos about two times. Overall, the 
health risk rates follow a similar trend regarding the impact of OBB 
emission on air quality in the five countries. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the 
areas with high-risk rates coincide with the areas where OBB has severe 
impacts (central and Southern Myanmar, Northern Thailand, Northern 
Laos, Northwest Vietnam, and Southeast Cambodia). Consequently, 
more restrictive control measures and health impact prevention are 
required, particularly in these areas. 
To illustrate the severity of OBB emission in MSEA, we compare our 
estimate with HIA studies of short-term exposure to OBB emission in 
other prominently fire-affected regions. Estimates of AC mortality in the 
NSA and PN regions of the US are 88 and 49 cases, respectively (Bal­
lesteros-Gonz´alez et al., 2020; Ravi et al., 2019). In our work, the esti­
mated mortality of AC is much higher than that of the studies in NSA and 
PN, which can be explained by three major differences. First, this work’s 
monthly mean PM2.5 concentration-derived OBB in March 2012 (79 ±
62 μg/m3) is significantly larger than that of the study in NSA (4.9 μg/m3 
in February 2010 and 7.1 μg/m3 in February 2018). As for the study in 
PN, the PM2.5 concentrations-derived OBB emission ranged from 1 
μg/m3 to 30 μg/m3 in October and November 2011, while that of our 
work ranged from 11.32 μg/m3 to 82.02 μg/m3. Second, the CRFs in our 
study were derived from two datasets: (1) the same fire-affected region 
within the MSEA, where OBB is a dominant emission source and (2) 
source-specific RRs of OBB emission in SEA region. However, these two 
studies derived RRs from the global estimate in Ballesteros-Gonz´alez 
et al. (2020) and the nationwide (US) analysis in Ravi et al. (2019), 
where PM2.5 exposure comes from multiple emission sources, resulting 
in different health risk values. These CRFs are smaller than our CRFs 
about two times. Third, the number and characteristics of the population 
exposed to OBB emission differ in terms of socioeconomic status, 
housing style, exposure time, and healthcare awareness. In conclusion, 
due to the inconsistency in experimental design and datasets, although 
we cannot directly compare our estimate of AC mortality with the two 
aforementioned studies in NSA and PN, it can be concluded that the 
public health impact of OBB emission in MSEA is severe and appropriate 
control measures are urgently needed to address this deleterious issue. 
In the context of the same geographic location, Reddington et al. 
(2021) estimated the health burden of long-term exposure to vegetation 
fires. Although there are substantial differences in the estimation (i.e., 
air quality model simulation, the exposure period to PM2.5, and RRs 
derived from Global Exposure Mortality Model without considering the 
source-specific health risks), our results are consistent with this study. 
First, among the five countries, OBB emission has the largest impact on 
PM2.5 concentration in Myanmar and Laos, while the smallest contri­
bution was found in Vietnam. Second, the highest public health impact 
was found in Myanmar, followed by Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia. Moreover, the highest health impact rates per 100,000 
population were found in Laos and Myanmar. 
3.4. Associated economic burdens attributable to PM2.5 from OBB 
The associated economic burden of mortality in this region due to 
exposure to PM2.5-derived OBB was estimated. The result shows that 
the economic burdens of AC (18UP), IHD, COPD, AC (all ages), respi­
ratory and CVD mortality were estimated to be 2.23 billion (95% CI: 
0.09–4.16), 1.05 billion (95% CI: 0.03–1.75), 0.62 billion (95% CI: 
0.15–0.93), 23.28 billion (95% CI: 18.69–27.57), 1.90 billion (95% CI: 
0.88–2.40) and 0.437 billion (95% CI: 0.20–0.67) 2012 USD, respec­
tively. The estimated economic burdens and their contributions to the 
2012 GDP per country are shown in Table 2 and Table A.5. The largest 
transferred VSL base value, as seen in Fig. 2, was of Thailand. Therefore, 
the economic burdens in Thailand were estimated to be highest for AC 
(18UP), IHD and CVD but lower for AC (all ages), COPD and respiratory 
mortality, than in Myanmar. This could be explained by the differences 
between Myanmar and Thailand in estimated health burden-based AC 
(18UP), IHD and CVD mortality, which are less significant than those in 
COPD mortality. Therefore, the estimated economic burden in Thailand 
was highest in terms of AC (18UP), IHD and CVD mortality, while the 
estimated economic burden in terms of AC (all ages), COPD and respi­
ratory mortality was highest in Myanmar. The estimated economic 
burdens of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia followed the same pattern as 
the estimated health burden for AC (18UP), IHD, COPD, respiratory and 
CVD. However, the contribution of estimated economic burdens attrib­
utable to OBB emission to GDP is highest in Myanmar when the dataset 
of Pothirat et al. (2019b) was applied, while the highest contribution 
was found in Laos when use Chen et al. (2021). The lowest contribution 
is found in Vietnam in both datasets. 
Fig. 8 depicts the geographical distribution of the estimated eco­
nomic burden on the MSEA scale. Areas with significant economic 
burdens are consistent with those of health burdens. Generally, a high 
economic burden was estimated in Thailand and Myanmar. Detailed 
analysis shows that the central region and Southern region of Myanmar, 
Northwestern Laos, Northern region, and central region of Thailand 
(Bangkok and surrounding areas), Southeast of Cambodia (Phnom 
Penh), and Northwestern region and Southern region of Vietnam were 
substantially affected by OBB emission in terms of estimated economic 
burdens. 
3.5. Uncertainty analysis 
The assessments and assumptions in this work may be subject to 
uncertainty. Regarding the assessments, first, CRFs were derived from 
two datasets, to minimize uncertainty in OBB emission-based health 
impact estimates. To be more specific, the factors of source apportion­
ment and geographical locations are considered carefully. The first 
dataset is a study of the population of Chiang Mai, a major city in the 
MSEA region suffering acute effects from particulate problem that OBB 
is the major emission source. CRF was calculated based on PM2.5 con­
centrations from the monitoring stations. However, this point may cause 
uncertainties in the analysis, in which the specific health risk from only 
OBB emission was not accounted. The second one is a study appor­
tioning PM2.5 mass into PM2.5-derived OBB by considering the differ­
ences between two simulations of with and without OBB in 749 
locations. RME values’ SEA region is a pool result from three mentioned 
countries in this region including the Philippines, Thailand and Viet­
nam. As a result, the comprehensive understanding of health impacts 
from OBB emission in the MSEA region is well-described in this work.

significant impacts of OBB emission (PM2.5-derived OBB ≥50 μg/m3).

Atmospheric Pollution Research 13 (2022) 101418

Second, the application of chemical transport modeling data for air 
quality related to OBB emission is superior to monitoring data in terms 
of spatial coverage. Although the monitoring stations can measure the 
actual PM2.5 concentration, there are few stations in the MSEA region, 
especially in Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia. Besides, the modeling data 
in this work were validated with the available monitoring data, which 
showed good agreement with observations (Pimonsree et al., 2018; 
Vongruang and Pimonsree, 2020). However, air quality modeling results 
may be subject to uncertainties in emission and simulated atmospheric 
processes. 
Third, Y0 values were extracted from the reliable source of infor­
mation—Global Burden of Disease (GBD), which has also been used in 
previous work at the regional scale, to ensure the consistency of datasets 
between the five countries (Koplitz et al., 2017; Reddington et al., 2021). 
However, Y0 values may vary across different regions depending on 
factors (e.g., people with pre-existing medical conditions and socio­
economic status), resulting in either under or overestimation of health 
impacts. 
Fourth, to reduce the uncertainty in this dataset, this work combined 
CIESIN-GPW data and the census data from each country’s government 
in 2012 in the population projection. Last, the VSL base value may vary, 
depending on socioeconomic status in different regions. Applying a fixed 
VSL base value for the entire country may lead to overestimation in rural 
areas and underestimation in urban areas. Additionally, VSL may 
overestimate the value of premature deaths since deaths are delayed, 
depending on pre-existing health conditions, rather than completely 
avoided (Martenies et al., 2015). Regarding the transferred methodol­
ogy, the most recent publication (J.J. Kim et al., 2019) applied the VSL 
values from OEDC. This method uses income elasticity adjustments not 
only for the 2012 level but also for the post-growth period before 2012. 
Therefore, the uncertainty in the estimation of monetary impacts is 
considerably lower. 
4. Conclusions 
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to assess public

health and the economic impacts in the sector of OBB emission source in 
MSEA with the application of CRFs considering the toxicity of OBB 
emission. We found that OBB is the prominent emission source in MSEA. 
Over 11 years (2011–2021), emissions from OBB were found to be a 
substantial contributor to PM2.5 concentrations in MSEA, accounting 
for 57% during the peak smog episode (March 2012). Disaggregated by 
country, emissions from OBB were estimated to contribute 70% to 
PM2.5 concentrations in Laos, followed by Myanmar (69%), Cambodia 
(54%), Thailand (47%), and Vietnam (31%). The highest estimated 
number of AC mortality (18UP) due to short-term exposure to PM2.5- 
derived OBB emission was found in Myanmar (3,152 cases – 95% CI: 
125-5,793), followed by Thailand (1,045 cases – 95% CI: 40-1,980), 
Vietnam (375 cases – 95% CI: 14–724), Laos (307 cases – 95% CI: 
13–540), and Cambodia (197 cases – 95% CI: 7–738). However, based 
on socioeconomic characteristics, the economic impact was estimated to 
be greatest in Thailand (1.19 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 0.05–2.25) because 
of the socioeconomic characteristic, followed by Myanmar (0.77 billion 
2012$ - 95% CI: 0.03–1.42), Vietnam (0.14 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 
0.005–0.26), Laos (0.10 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 0.004–0.17), and 
Cambodia (0.03 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 0.001–0.06). Regarding the all- 
age population, the highest number of AC mortality was estimated to 
have been in Myanmar (56,514 cases – 95% CI: 45,392–66,894), fol­
lowed by Laos (11,131 cases – 95% CI: 9,056–13,022), Thailand (3,629 
cases – 95% CI: 2,980–4,330), Cambodia (3,625 cases – 95% CI: 
2,895–4,345) and Vietnam (3,376 cases – 95% CI: 2,682–4,038). The 
associated economic impact was estimated to be largest in Myanmar 
(13.85 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 11.12–16.39), followed by Thailand 
(4.14 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 3.30–4.94), Laos (3.48 billion 2012$ - 95% 
CI: 2.83–4.07), Vietnam (1.22 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 0.97–1.46) and 
Cambodia (0.59 billion 2012$ - 95% CI: 0.47–0.71). 
To our knowledge, epidemiological studies on RME due to the 
exposure to OBB emission were first synthesized in MSEA to provide a 
comprehensive knowledge based on health risks from OBB. Seven 
studies were conducted in acutely affected areas due to OBB emission 
from Thailand (Northern Thailand). The lag time factor was found to be 
distinguished from other overseas studies, which is significant at lag 6

and lag 7, for example. PM10 and hospitalization are mainly investi­
gated in this region, although PM2.5 and mortality have more adverse 
health risks. The characteristics of the human body, age groups, nutri­
tional features, exposure duration, housing styles, human behavior, and 
socioeconomic status in MSEA are different from other regions world­
wide. Differences in the chemical composition of various fire emissions 
may lead to diverse health effects. Moreover, there is a large body of 
literature from overseas showing that the health risks from OBB emis­
sion sources are different from other emission sources. Therefore, future 
OBB-based HIA studies should derive CRFs from RME values related to 
OBB emission in the research area by applying source apportionment 
methodology to minimize the uncertainty of the estimates. Additionally, 
the association between the exposure to OBB emission and human 
health effects should be further investigated with more focus on 
different age groups, genders, exposure levels, air pollutants, and health 
endpoints in each MSEA country. 
This study reveals the severe human health and associated economic 
impacts of OBB emission in MSEA. The results are analyzed at the 
regional and national levels and provide substantial information to 
policymakers. These findings can be employed to address the negative 
effects of significant air quality issues on human health and the economy 
in MSEA. Analysis of the spatial distribution of public health benefits is 
useful for formulating local environmental policies in specific regions. 
Large amounts of economic impact attributable to the exposure to OBB 
emission emphasize the importance of enforcing stronger public policies 
to consolidate air quality improvements. With quantitative data and 
thresholds, this work also provides useful public health insights and 
assist in developing workable control measures. Addressing the OBB 
emission issue in the MSEA region requires effective regional coopera­
tion among five countries.

Annual PM2.5 in 2016 were simulated by WRF-CAMx. RRs were calculated from Global 
Exposure Mortality Model (Burnett et al., 2018) using data from the 41 cohort studies. There 
would be 1415 avoided mortalities if PM2.5 was reduced to meet WHO AQS (10 μg/m3). 
Moreover, reducing PM2.5 to counterfactual concentration (2.4 μg/m3) would save 2990 
mortalities.

Observed PM2.5 over Thailand in 2016 and a low-concentration threshold value below which 
PM2.5 has no effect on mortality were used to estimate health burdens. The exposure-response 
functions were based on a study of (Burnett et al., 2014) and Cui et al., 2018. The number of 
deaths attributable to stroke burden, ischemic heart disease, lung cancer and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease were 18,003.

Abstract
Background: Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of air pollution and particulate matter (PM) in Southeast Asia. However, the health effects 
of PM smaller than 10 µm (PM10) originating from BB may differ from those of other sources. This study aimed to estimate the short-term asso­
ciation of PM10 from BB with respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions in Peninsular Malaysia, a region often exposed to BB events.
Methods: We obtained and analyzed daily data on hospital admissions, PM10 levels and BB days from five districts from 2005 to 2015. We identified 
BB days by evaluating the BB hotspots and backward wind trajectories. We estimated PM10 attributable to BB from the excess of the moving average 
of PM10 during days without BB hotspots. We fitted time-series quasi-Poisson regression models for each district and pooled them using meta- 
analyses. We adjusted for potential confounders and examined the lagged effects up to 3days, and potential effect modification by age and sex.
Results: We analyzed 210 960 respiratory and 178 952 cardiovascular admissions. Almost 50% of days were identified as BB days, with a 
mean PM10 level of 53.1 µg/m3 during BB days and 40.1 µg/m3 during normal days. A 10 µg/m3 increment in PM10 from BB was associated with 
a 0.44% (95% CI: 0.06, 0.82%) increase in respiratory admissions at lag 0–1, with a stronger association in adults aged 15–64 years and 
females. We did not see any significant associations for cardiovascular admissions.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that short-term exposure to PM10 from BB increased the risk of respiratory hospitalizations in Peninsular Malaysia.
Keywords: Biomass burning, particulate matter, respiratory diseases, Southeast Asia. 
Introduction
Biomass Burning (BB) is a major source of air pollution that 
affects human health worldwide.1 BB emits large amounts of 
particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants into the 
atmosphere, causing poor air quality and health hazards.1,2
Exposure to BB emissions could increase the risks of respira­
tory and cardiovascular diseases, hospitalizations and 
deaths.3–6 Previous literatures have stated that BB events in

Malaysia stems from both local and transboundary sources 
such as land use change, agricultural expansion and forest 
managements.7–10 These days are known as ‘haze days’ by 
communities in the region to describe the obscurity of the at­
mosphere due to BB.
Most studies have used simple methods to define BB events 
and estimate PM levels from BB, which may not capture the 
complexity and variability of BB exposure.11–15 Some studies 
have used a fixed PM threshold (PM10 >100 µg/m3 or PM2.5 
>35 µg/m3) to define a BB day,4–6 or the Pollutant Index 
above a specific threshold,11,15 while others have used a per­
centile threshold to identify bushfire events, such as the 90th 
percentile,14 the 95th percentile12 or the 99th percentile13 of 
the observed PM distribution. These methods, however, may 
overlook smaller events with PM concentrations below the 
threshold or miss the variability of PM levels within BB 
events. They may also be influenced by other sources of PM 
that are not related to BB, such as traffic or industry.
As previous studies on BB/haze days in Southeast Asia have 
analyzed their impact on health outcomes using binary indica­
tors,5,14 they might not account for the source-specific contri­
bution of PM10 from BB events, which may vary depending on 
the location, season and meteorology. Hence, since PM10 is a 
major pollutant during BB events and can have adverse health 
effects,16,17 there is public health relevance in examining the 
health effects of PM10 by distinguishing between BB PM10 and 
non-BB PM10 while also considering the modifying effect of 
the events.
In this study, we examined the short-term association be­
tween source-specific PM10 (based on the occurrence of BB) 
and hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular 
diseases in Peninsular Malaysia. To our knowledge, this in­
vestigation is the first to use a continuous measurement for 
BB-related PM10 and assess its association with hospital 
admissions in Southeast Asia.
Methods
Study location and period
We selected five major districts spanning north to south of 
Peninsular Malaysia (Figure 1). They include Kinta, Kuantan, 
Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Johor Bahru, with populations 
ranging from slightly below half a million in Kuantan to over 
1.6 million in Kuala Lumpur (Table 1).18 These districts were 
chosen to represent different geographical regions and urban­
ization levels in Peninsular Malaysia. The study period ranges 
from 2005 to 2015 depending on the availability of hospital 
admission data.
Environmental exposure data
We obtained daily air pollution and meteorological measure­
ments from the Continuous Air Quality Monitoring (CAQM) 
stations managed by the Department of Environment Malaysia. 
Besides PM10 and temperature, other gaseous pollutants such as 
carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2), ozone (O3), as well as relative humidity were collected 
for sensitivity analyses. We downloaded daily fire hotspot data 
from the Fire Information for Resource Management System 
(FIRMS) archive covering an area from 4S to 10N and 95E 
to 120E. The fire hotspot data were measured by the Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We 
selected observations with high confidence from the MCD14DL 
fire identification product. We filtered for hotspots recorded 
with a confidence level of ≥80% to minimize false alarms19 and 
as type ‘presumed vegetation fires’20 to focus on BB. We in­
cluded all Fire Radiative Power values to account for smaller 
hotspots likely associated with agricultural residue burning.21
Health outcome data
We collected daily count of hospital admissions for respira­
tory diseases [International Classification of Diseases 10th re­
vision (ICD-10): J00-J99] and cardiovascular diseases 
(ICD-10: I00-I99) from the Health Information Centre, 
Ministry of Health Malaysia. At least one major hospital in 
each city was included (seven in total, six state hospitals and 
one respiratory medical institute). The data were stratified 
by gender and age groups: 0–14 (child), 15–64 (adult) and 
65 years and above (elderly). We paired each hospital with the 
closest CAQM station (within 10 km) for exposure matching.
Identification of BB days
We used the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated 
Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model by the Air Resources Laboratory 
(ARL), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) to estimate the backward wind trajectories from each 
CAQM station with a resolution of 1 latitude and longitude. 
The trajectories were estimated at 500, 1000 and 1500m above 
ground, twice a day at 12-hours interval at 00:00 and 
12:00hours, with a duration of 72-hours to cover the distance 
of both local and transboundary sources within the area as most 
peat fires in Kalimantan burned for more than 24hours.22 The 
procedure was accomplished using the splitr package in R. To 
identify BB days, we merged the daily information from the 
MODIS fire hotspots and the HYSPLIT backward wind trajec­
tories. We created a buffer of 0.5 radius for all trajectory coor­
dinates. Days with at least one buffer containing a fire hotspot 
were defined as ‘BB days’, while others as ‘normal days’ 
(Supplementary Figure S1, available as Supplementary data at 
IJE online). The process is automated using Python script.
PM10 attributable to BB
We adapted the European Union reference method23,24 to es­
timate the daily levels of PM10 attributable to BB. This 
method had been proven to estimate source-specific PM lev­
els in areas with natural or anthropogenic sources (i.e. dust 
storms or wildfires).24,25 We removed the days with BB iden­
tified in the previous step, and calculated the 90-day moving 
average using the PM10 levels observed on the remaining nor­
mal days without BB. The moving average was based a 
3-month period to accommodate locations that documented 
BB events continuously for 60 days. This provides a smoothed 
daily concentration to represent background PM10 unrelated 
to BB (essentially the non-BB PM10 on BB days). PM10 level at­
tributable to BB (BB PM10) was obtained by subtracting the 
moving average from the total concentration observed at a 
given station during a BB Day.
Statistical analysis
We conducted a two-stage analysis. We used a time series 
model to estimate the source-specific associations (BB PM10 
and non-BB PM10) during BB days or normal days repre­
sented by an interaction term with the BB indicator. We 
chose this model to account for the potential differences in 
the effects of PM10 from BB and non-BB sources during BB 
days and normal days. PM10 with a lag duration of up to

Results
Descriptive results
During the study, we observed 210 960 respiratory and 
178 952 cardiovascular hospital admissions, averaging 22.2 
and 18.9 daily cases (Table 1). Children (49.9%), adults 
(33.8%) and the elderly (16.8%) were the primary groups for 
respiratory admissions, while for cardiovascular cases, the 
majority were adults (64.4%), followed by the elderly 
(33.1%) and children (2.5%). Males represented a higher per­
centage of cases in both categories (Supplementary Table S1, 
available as Supplementary data at IJE online). BB events oc­
curred on 4868 days, nearly half the study period, with PM10 
levels averaging 53.1 μg/m3 on BB days vs 40.1 μg/m3 on 
non-BB days. Alternative BB day definitions based on fixed 
(PM10 ≥100 µg/m3) or percentile thresholds (PM10 ≥95th 
percentile) significantly reduced the BB day count to 1.9% 
and 5% (Table 2).
Association between PM exposures and 
hospital admissions
Table 3 presents the estimated risks of hospital admissions 
for exposure to source-specific PM10. For respiratory admis­
sions, exposure to BB PM10 was associated with 0.44% 
(95% CI: 0.06%, 0.80%) higher for cumulative lag 0–1 days. 
We did not find any associations for non-BB PM10 on BB 
days. On normal days, the estimated risk increase for expo­
sure to non-BB PM10 was larger and more delayed up to lag 
0–4 days (%IR ¼ 3.14%; 95% CI: 2.13%, 4.15%). For car­
diovascular admissions, we did not find any significant risk 
increases, except for exposure to non-BB PM10 on BB days 
where risk decreases were observed for lag 0–2 and 0–3. The 
location-specific risk estimates appeared homogeneous for 
both admission causes (all P-values for Q >0.05).
We also examined possible effect modification by age and 
gender subgroups. Figure 2 shows the results stratified by age 
and gender subgroups. Exposure to BB PM10 was associated 
with increased respiratory admissions in the adult and female 
subgroups with %IR of 0.76% (95% CI: 0.09%, 1.43%) and 
0.57% (95% CI: 0.39%, 0.75%), respectively. On normal

days, respiratory admissions showed a positive association 
with exposure to non-BB PM10 amongst the females at %IR of 
1.35% (95% CI: 0.13%, 2.58%). This association was not 
observed during BB days. For cardiovascular admissions, we 
did not find any associations across the different subgroups.
Our study found that different degrees of freedom didn’t sig­
nificantly affect quasi-AIC values (Supplementary Table S3, 
available as Supplementary data at IJE online), and buffer size 
changes mostly yielded consistent results, except for non-BB 
PM10 on BB days which varied by admission cause 
(Supplementary Figures S2 and S3, available as Supplementary 
data at IJE online). Larger buffers increased respiratory risks 
but not cardiovascular ones. Additional adjustments for gases 
and humidity had minimal impact (Supplementary Figures S4 
and S5, available as Supplementary data at IJE online). 
Different methods for defining BB days, like fixed or percentile 
thresholds, altered results compared to the HYSPLIT-MODIS 
method, with fixed thresholds indicating increased risks for BB 
and non-BB PM10 (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7, available 
as Supplementary data at IJE online).
Discussion
In this study, we examined the associations between PM10 
attributable to BB and hospital admissions in Peninsular 
Malaysia. We used a novel exposure definition that allowed 
us to disentangle the associations between PM10 and hospital 
admissions attributable to BB and non-BB sources during BB 
days and normal days. We found that respiratory admissions 
were associated with BB PM10 and non-BB PM10 during nor­
mal days. The lag time was relatively shorter for BB PM10 
(0–1 days) and longer for non-BB PM10 during normal days

(0–4 days). Subgroup analysis showed evidence of associa­
tions in adults aged 15–64 years old and females. We did not 
observe consistent associations for cardiovascular dis­
ease admissions.
Our results suggest that both BB PM10 and non-BB PM10 
can have an adverse effect on respiratory admissions, with BB 
PM10 having a more immediate impact while non-BB PM10 
has a longer lag association. The difference in the size of the 
estimated effects and the lag structure between BB PM10 and 
non-BB PM10 may be related to the BB/haze warning systems 
implemented in Malaysia. The Department of Environment 
and mass media provide alerts for BB/haze days in Malaysia 
by updates its website with API and BB/haze warnings35 and 
news highlights during a BB/haze day. These BB/haze warn­
ing systems could lead to changes in behavior, such as staying 
indoors and reducing exposure, during BB/haze days. 
However, even though API calculations from monitoring sta­
tions are published daily, PM10 concentrations during normal 
days may be neglected due to media focus on BB/haze days, 
resulting in delayed associations in our models. Another pos­
sible explanation for the associations with respiratory admis­
sions could be the toxicity of source specific PM10. A study 
by de Oliveira Alves et al. (2017) also suggests that exposure 
to PM10 which is also abundant during non-bb days can 
cause significant damage to human lung cells.36
We did not find a consistent association between PM10 ex­
posure and cardiovascular disease admissions. Negative asso­
ciations were observed for lag 0–2 and 0–3 with non-BB 
PM10 during BB days. One possible reason for the association 
is that people who have existing risk factors for CVD (i.e. hy­
pertension, high cholesterol) may have other underlying 
conditions and are aware of their risks thus reducing their 
time outside even more. The National Health and Morbidity 
Survey 2019 in Malaysia showed that approximately 1.7 mil­
lion (8.1%) people currently live with three major risk factors 
(High cholesterol, Hypertension and Diabetes) and approxi­
mately 3.4 million (16%) live with two major risk factors.37
Compared to respiratory disease, the results for cardiovascu­
lar disease admissions were inconsistent when we used differ­
ent buffer sizes in the sensitivity analysis to identify BB days. 
Previous studies have also reported inconsistent results re­
garding the association between BB events or PM10 exposure 
and cardiovascular outcomes.13,38–40 This lack of association 
between cardiovascular hospital admissions and PM10 expo­
sure could be due to the immediate onset of cardiovascular 
diseases. The association between PM10 and cardiovascular 
outcomes might be better reflected using emergency room vis­
itation data rather than hospital admission data as the sever­
ity of a cardiovascular disease onset might cause it to be 
treated immediately by emergency personnel,41–43 with only 
severe cases being admitted to the hospital.
Our subgroup analysis found a significantly positive asso­
ciation between BB PM10 and the adult subgroup. The 
Department of Statistics Malaysia, (2010) recorded that the 
highest percentage of occupations for adults in Malaysia are 
in service and sales (19.3%), elementary occupations 
(12.2%) and plant and machine operation (11.7%).18 These 
occupations often involve outdoor labour, travel, construc­
tion or manual labour and have higher effect estimates of air 
pollutants compared to white-collar jobs.44 This prolonged 
outdoor exposure, and pre-existing medical conditions may 
increase the risk of disease. We also found significantly posi­
tive risk estimates among females, which is consistent with 
some literature that found higher risks for respiratory/asthma 
diseases in females.40,42,45,46 This may be due to hormonal 
factors unique to females,47 such as the pre-menstrual or 
menstrual phase of their monthly cycle which could increase 
the breathing rate,48 exacerbate asthma symptoms,49 and re­
duce lung function.50
Our study has several strengths. Firstly, we used a multi- 
criteria method to improve the identification of BB days. This 
process is computationally intensive as it involves calculating 
many back trajectories to provide daily coordinates for 
detecting fire hotspots at three different altitudes. Secondly, 
to our knowledge, this is the first study in Malaysia to distin­
guish the effects of source specific PM10 from BB and exam­
ine their short-term associations with respiratory and 
cardiovascular hospital admissions. Our results suggest that 
the effects of BB PM10 and non-BB PM10 were consistent 
across Peninsular Malaysia and that the pooled results can be 
used to represent the region. Our study also has several limi­
tations. Firstly, the definition of BB PM10 we used is an adap­
tation from desert dust definitions by Escudero et al.51 and 
Tobıas and Stafoggia,24 and there is no existing knowledge 
on how to assess PM10%iles using chemical source apportion­
ment data during BB events in Southeast Asia. Secondly, we 
used ground monitor PM10 concentrations to reflect expo­
sure, but we cannot accurately determine if patients were 
exposed to the same daily PM10 concentration throughout 
the study period. Thirdly, we were unable to control for pre- 
existing health conditions in our model due to a lack of data. 
Fourthly, while we filtered for ‘presumed vegetation fires’, 
some non-vegetation fires may have been included in our 
analysis. Finally, our results should not be generalized to 
other locations with different topographical, meteorological 
and fire sources.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that exposure to PM10 from BB is associ­
ated with increased respiratory hospital admissions in 
Peninsular Malaysia, especially among adults and females. 
The effect of BB PM10 is more immediate than that of non- 
BB PM10, which has a longer lag association. We did not find 
consistent associations between PM10 exposure and cardio­
vascular hospital admissions. Our findings have implications 
for public health policy and intervention, as they highlight the 
need to monitor and reduce the exposure to PM10 from BB, es­
pecially during BB events, and to raise the awareness of the 
health risks of PM10 from non-BB sources during normal days. 
Future research could include using Chemical Transport Model 
to identify and measure BB PM10 more accurately, as well as the 
potential interactions with other air pollutants or risk factors.

"1.  Introduction
In Africa, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) caused 1.1 million premature deaths, when considering ambient and 
household air pollution (361,000 of the deaths attributed to ambient PM2.5) in 2019 (Fisher et al., 2021; Murray 
et al., 2020) making it the leading environmental risk factor for premature death, ahead of unsafe water, unsafe 
sanitation, and handwashing. PM2.5 leads to health impacts because particles can travel far beyond the head 
airways and deposit deep in the tracheobronchial or alveolar region of the respiratory system, depending on the 
diameter of the particle (Hussein et al., 2013; Kodros et al., 2018; Londahl et al., 2009). Long-term exposure 
to PM2.5 has been linked to heart failure, pneumonia, Parkinson's disease, urinary tract infections, dementia, 
Alzheimer's disease, increased risk for psychiatric disorders, depression, anxiety, increased brain inflammation, 
reduced fertility and miscarriages, Ischemic heart disease (IHD), lung cancer (LC), stoke, and chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease (COPD), etc. (Allen et al., 2016; Braithwaite et al., 2019; Elliott et al., 2013; Grande 
et al., 2020; Henderson et al., 2011; Holstius et al., 2012; Ilango & Shaffer, 2020; Johnston et al., 2012; Naeher 
et al., 2007; Peeples, 2020; Stefanidou et al., 2008; Veras et al., 2010). Many people across Africa currently live 
in regions that exceed the World Health Organization's (WHO) newly revised PM2.5 guideline of annual average 
Abstract  Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the second leading risk factor 
of premature death in Sub-Saharan Africa. We use GEOS-Chem to quantify the effects of (a) trash burning, 
(b) residential solid-fuel burning, and (c) open biomass burning (BB) (i.e., landscape fires) on ambient PM2.5 
and PM2.5-attributable mortality in Africa. Using a series of sensitivity simulations, we excluded each of the 
three combustion sources in each of five African regions. We estimate that in 2017 emissions from these three 
combustion sources within Africa increased global ambient PM2.5 by 2%, leading to 203,000 (95% confidence 
interval: 133,000–259,000) premature mortalities yr −1 globally and 167,000 premature mortalities yr −1 in 
Africa. BB contributes more ambient PM2.5-related premature mortalities per year (63%) than residential 
solid-fuel burning (29%) and trash burning (8%). Open BB in Central Africa leads to the largest number of 
PM2.5-attributed mortalities inside the region, while trash burning in North Africa and residential solid-fuel 
burning in West Africa contribute the most regional mortalities for each source. Overall, Africa has a unique 
ambient air pollution profile because natural sources, such as windblown dust and BB, contribute strongly 
to ambient PM2.5 levels and PM2.5-related mortality. Air pollution policies may need to focus on taking 
preventative measures to avoid exposure to ambient PM2.5 from these less-controllable sources.
Plain Language Summary  Air pollution substantially impacts human health in Africa and may 
continue to get worse in the coming years with population and economic growth and urbanization. In this 
modeling study, we estimate the health benefits from removing three combustion sources (trash burning, 
residential biofuel used for home cooking and heating, and open biomass burning) and the regional differences 
across Africa. Our finding suggests that eliminating these sources in Africa can prevent 167,000 premature 
mortalities each year in the continent alone and 203,000 deaths globally. The information we provide may help 
policy makers in developing appropriate policies to mitigate the impacts of air pollution in Africa.

concentration of 5 μg m −3 (Ayetor et al., 2021; WHO, 2021a, 2021b). Additionally, Africa is experiencing rapid 
urbanization, population growth, and a growing economy, and it is projected to grow to 40% of the world's 
population by 2100 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, & Population Division, 2017). 
Africa is projected to have the fastest urban growth rate in the world: by 2050, Africa's cities will be home to 
an additional 950 million people, and the continent's population is anticipated to be primarily urban by 2035 
(OECD/SWAC, 2020). Thus, air pollution is likely to increase and impact more people across the continent in the 
future (Abera et al., 2021; Coker & Kizito, 2018).
The PM2.5 in Africa likely has different physical properties (e.g., size, composition) than PM2.5 in many other 
parts of the world. Compared to other regions of the world, such as North America and Europe, there are rela-
tively few studies on the sources, composition, and health impacts of PM2.5 in Africa (Abera et al., 2021; Katoto 
et al., 2019; Liousse et al., 2014). Important sources of PM2.5 in Africa include waste burning, residential solid-
fuel burning for cooking and heating, and open biomass burning (BB) (Amegah & Agyei-Mensah, 2017; Bearak 
et al., 2021; Mead et al., 2008; Naidja et al., 2018; World Health Organization, 2016). We selected these three 
combustion sources because they are more diffuse and inefficient than sources that have been studied in North 
America and Europe (e.g., traffic, industry, power generation). While there are other large sources of PM2.5 on 
the African continent, such as natural dust (Kotsyfakis et al., 2019; Urrutia-Pereira et al., 2021), here, we focus 
on three diffuse combustion sources because they are less controlled across Africa in comparison to other regions 
of the world, are understudied and unique from fossil-fuel sources that have been studied more historically, and 
they may have increased emissions in the future with population growth and climate change.
Although some countries have regulations in place that prohibit open trash burning, waste burning is common 
across Africa due the lack of solid waste collection services, the inability to fund collection programs, and poor 
waste management (Godfrey et al., 2019; Solomon, 2011). Residents in Africa generate low quantities of waste 
when compared to other regions of the world, however, only approximately 44% of waste is collected and the 
future growth rates of waste generation are likely to be large (Godfrey et al., 2019). Sub-Saharan Africa generates 
less than 0.6 kg per capita per day as opposed to an average of 2.2 kg per capita per day in developed countries 
(Hoornweg & Bhada-Tata, 2012). When residents burn waste, toxic gaseous and PM2.5 are emitted (Christian 
et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014), leading to degradation of regional air 
quality.
More than 60% of people who live in Africa still depend on residential combustion of solid fuels such as wood, 
coal, dung, crop waste, and charcoal for household heating and cooking (Bonjour et al., 2013; Eberhard et al., 2008; 
Girard, 2002; World Health Organization. Regional Office for South-East Asia, 2006). When combusted, resi-
dential solid fuels emit high levels PM2.5 with a large fraction composed of black carbon and organic matter. Air 
pollution from residential solid fuels impacts indoor air quality as well as outdoor air quality in regions of heavy 
use. Because of the large electricity deficit in Africa (IEA, 2021) residential solid-fuel use is widespread, thus 
negatively impacting air quality and public health across the region. Population growth in Africa is projected to 
outpace future electricity access gains (IEA, 2021). According to recent studies, there has been a slow decrease in 
the use of residential solid fuel for cooking in Africa but few programs have been created to switch to clean fuels 
for cooking (Stoner et al., 2021).
Across Africa, open BB (i.e., landscape burning) is the largest source of primary fine carbonaceous particles and 
the second largest source of trace gasses (Aghedo et al., 2007; Andreae & Merlet, 2001; Bond et al., 2004; Giglio 
et al., 2013). Open BB refers to wildfires, prescribed burning, and agricultural fires, and it encompasses a range 
of fuel types (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands). Africa is the largest source of global BB total carbon emissions, 
contributing ∼52% of global BB emissions (Roberts et al., 2009; van der Werf et al., 2003, 2006, 2010). Open 
BB occurs between November and February in the Northern Hemisphere of Africa (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, 
Nigeria, Niger, Cameron, Sudan, Uganda) and June until October in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Congo, 
Angola, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana and Zambia, Namibia, Mozambique, Malawi) (Roberts et al., 2009). 
These emissions have a substantial impact on human health and air quality locally and downwind (Li et al., 2021)
Here, we use the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model to quantify the effects of three combustion 
sources in Africa: (a) trash burning, (b) residential solid-fuel burning, and (c) open BB across the five regions of 
Africa defined by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD): North, Southern, West, Central, and East Africa (Figure 
S1 in Supporting Information S1). We present an analysis of a range of regional sensitivity simulations to inves-
tigate the impacts of local emissions and regional transport on ambient PM2.5 levels across Africa. We use the

GBD approach with newly updated concentration-response function from R. Burnett et al. (2018) to estimate the 
PM2.5-attributable mortalities from local and transported air pollution for each of the emissions sources in each of 
five African regions. To our knowledge, very few health impact assessments have been conducted in this region 
of the world for the three combustion sources we address here.
2.  Methods
2.1.  GEOS-Chem Model Configuration
We use the global 3-D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem version v12.6.0 (https://doi.org/10.5281/
zenodo.3507501) aerosol-only simulation with offline oxidation fields (Bey et  al.,  2001; Leibensperger 
et al., 2012; R. J. Park et al., 2004). The model is driven by assimilated meteorological data from the Goddard 
Earth Observing System Forward Processing product (GEOS-FP) provided by the NASA Global Model and 
Assimilation Office (GMAO, https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov). Each GEOS-Chem simulation was conducted at a 
horizontal resolution of 2° × 2.5° (∼222 by 277.5 km) with 47 vertical layers for the year of 2017 with a one 
month spin up. The model produced surface level ambient PM2.5 concentrations over the continent of Africa 
including all emission sources using the following equation.
PM2.5 = 1.33 (NH4 + NIT + SO4) + BCPI + BCPO + 1.5 (OCPO + 1.16 ∗OCPI)
+1.16 ∗SOA + DST1 + 0.38 ∗DST2 + 1.86 ∗SALA

(1)
Equation 1 includes ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NIT), sulfate (SO4), hydrophilic black and organic carbon (BCPI 
and OCPI), hydrophobic black and organic carbon (BCPO and OCPO), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), fine-
mode dust aerosol size bins (DST1 and DST2), and fine-mode sea salt (SALA) to calculate surface level ambient 
PM2.5 at an assumed relative humidity of 35%.
Anthropogenic emissions are based on the Community Emissions Data System GBD-Major Air Pollution 
Sources (CEDSGBD-MAPS) inventory (McDuffie et al., 2020), which is a collection of several inventories and 
includes trash (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014) and residential solid-fuel burning emissions to ambient air in Africa 
(Marais & Wiedinmyer, 2016). There are four open BB emissions inventories available over Africa for use with 
GEOS-Chem: The Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) (Giglio et al., 2013), Fire INventory from NCAR 
(FINN) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2011), Quick Fire Emissions Data set (QFED) (Koster et al., 2015), and the Global 
Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) (Kaiser et al., 2012). (See Text S1 in Supporting Information S1) We conducted 
simulations using each of the four BB emissions inventories to evaluate the impacts of inventory choice on 
surface level ambient PM2.5 estimates over Africa. We used the Mineral Dust Entrainment and Deposition model 
(Zeng et al., 2019) to account for emissions of mineral dust. Sea salt emissions followed (Jaegle et al., 2011).
The 28 simulations presented in this study are summarized in Table 1. The first four simulations were base-case 
simulations that varied the open BB emissions inventory. To evaluate the performance of each open BB inven-
tory, we compared the first four simulations to annually averaged PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) 
by conducting a linear least squares regression (Figure 1 and Figure S2 in Supporting Information S1). (See 
Section 2.3 for additional details.) The All_on_QFED simulation better reproduced annually-averaged surface 
level ambient PM2.5 estimates than the simulations that used the other BB emission inventories: thus, we used the 
QFED inventory for the remaining 24 simulations.
The remaining simulations were sensitivity simulations that were used to evaluate the impacts of each of the three 
combustion sources (i.e., trash burning, residential solid-fuel burning, and open BB) by region. By comparing 
each sensitivity simulation with the base case, we isolated the influence of regional emissions and atmospheric 
transport on ambient PM2.5 levels across the continent. We conducted six sensitivity simulations for each of 
the three combustion sources, five simulations where the source was turned off in each of the five African 
regions and one simulation where the source was turned off across the whole African continent. Additionally, we 
conducted a set of six simulations where we turned off all three of the combustion sources together in each of the 
five African regions and across the whole African continent.
2.2.  Health Impact Assessment
We used our base case and sensitivity simulations to estimate the PM2.5-attributable mortalities from local emis-
sions and atmospheric transport across the continent using the GBD approach. To calculate PM2.5-attributable

mortalities, we used baseline 2017 mortality data from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (http://
ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) for five causes of premature mortalities: stroke, LC, IHD, COPD, and 
lower respiratory infections (LRI). Additionally, we used gridded population for 2015 from the NASA Socioec-
onomic Data and Application Center (SEDAC, N. E., 2022). We regridded our model resolution of 2° × 2.5° to 
the population data resolution of 0.25° × 0.25°.
The Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) concentration response function (CRF) was used to relate ambi-
ent PM2.5 exposures to the risk of mortality (R. Burnett et al., 2018) for premature mortalities across all age 
groups. The GEMM was formulated by 41 cohort epidemiological studies in 16 countries (but not including 
any African countries) for adults that are older than 25 years old and assumes all PM2.5 components have equal 
toxicity. We selected this CRF, because it is based on a larger data set with wider geographical coverage and

included a wider range of ambient air pollution exposure levels compared to previous CRF meta analyses. Using 
the GEMM coefficients we report mean premature mortalities including their uncertainty range of ±2 × standard 
error. Further, we acknowledge that our choice of GEMM CRF, which does not include health studies in Africa 
(R. Burnett et al., 2018), assumes equal toxicity for all PM2.5 components (M. Park et al., 2018), and is applied to 
all age groups, will contribute to uncertainty in our mortality estimates. We applied the CRF using the attribution 
method. The equation used to calculate PM2.5-attributable mortality from residential solid-fuel use from emis-
sions in North Africa is provided below.

where MRS_North is defined as the number of premature mortalities attributable to residential solid-fuel combustion 
emissions in North Africa, PM2.5,BASE is the estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations the base case simulation, 
and PM2.5,RS_North is the estimated ambient PM2.5 concentrations from each of the simulation where residential 
solid-fuel use emissions were turned off in the North, and MBASE is total PM2.5-related mortalities in the base case 
simulation. For each of the five GBD regions of Africa, we used an equivalent version of Equation 2 to calculate 
the annual premature mortalities attributed to emissions from each combustion source in each region.
Measurement data that is available across Africa suggests that ambient PM2.5 concentrations vary substantially 
throughout Africa (Arku, 2015; Arku et al., 2008). Our model resolution does not capture the spatial variability 
of PM2.5 at the city-scale, which may lead to exposure misclassification. Kodros et al. (2016) suggested that lower 
horizontal model grid resolutions may underestimate the fraction of the population that is exposed to higher PM2.5 
concentrations at least for anthropogenic sources that spatially correlate with where people live, meaning that our 
PM2.5-related mortality values may be biased low.
2.3.  Model Evaluation
Insufficient PM2.5 monitoring data exists across Africa (Martin et al., 2019). Therefore, we used annually aver-
aged PM2.5 estimates from Hammer et al. (2020) to evaluate our simulations. These estimates combine data 
from satellites, ground measurements, and chemical-transport models. We evaluated the model using statistical 
metrics: the slope, coefficient of determination (R 2), mean normalized bias, mean bias (MB), mean normalized

error, mean error, and normalized mean bias (NMB). Hammer et al. (2020) estimates are provided at 0.1° × 0.1° 
degree resolution, so we regridded the data to 2° × 2.5° for the model-estimate comparisons.
3.  Results and Discussion
3.1.  Evaluation of Modeled PM2.5
The global comparison of the Hammer et al. (2020) PM2.5 estimates to the GEOS-Chem estimates for the BASE 
case are given in Figure 1. We acknowledge that the lack of continuous ground-based monitoring of PM2.5 in 
Africa leads to uncertainty in estimated PM2.5 concentrations. The choice and uncertainty of emission inventories 
may also lead to uncertainty in estimated PM2.5 concentrations. Further uncertainty in the percentage of ambient 
PM2.5 that is emitted from a certain source can lead to large uncertainties in premature mortality estimates in 
Africa according Kodros et al. (2018). On an annual global basis compared to Hammer et al. (2020), GEOS-
Chem ambient global PM2.5 estimates have a NMB of −6.9% (Figure 1) a R 2 of 0.776. The negative bias from 
our model ambient PM2.5 will contribute to uncertainties in our PM2.5-attributed premature mortality estimates 
from each of the three combustion sources covered in this study particularly as we cannot evaluate the bias in 
each source separately.
3.2.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for All Three Combustion Sources
Figure  2 shows the percentage change in annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 when all three combustion 
sources are removed. The annual-average percent changes in surface ambient PM2.5 are presented in Table 2. 
Results are presented based on the region of Africa where the air pollution is emitted (i.e., North, Southern, East, 
West, Central) and the region that is impacted by the emissions. In addition to presenting the impacts across the 
five African regions, Table 2 also contains the percent change in ambient PM2.5 concentrations due to emissions 
from each of the five regions to the entire African continent itself and outside of the African continent (Table 2). 
Although the Northern and Southern Hemisphere portions of Africa have different open BB seasons (Ramo 
et al., 2021), we present the annual-average changes in surface ambient PM2.5 because the annual changes are 
used to estimate the impacts of chronic exposure to ambient PM2.5.

Overall, these three combustion sources substantially impact ambient PM2.5 across 
Africa, and they have a non-trivial impact outside of Africa. Across the African conti-
nent, these three sources contribute 28% of annual-average ambient PM2.5 and 6% across 
the globe (Table 2, Figure 2f). Within Africa, the impact is largest over Central Africa, 
where these three combustion sources contribute 72% of the ambient PM2.5 within Africa. 
These  three  sources have the smallest impact on ambient PM2.5 over North Africa (8%).
Across all regions, local emissions from these three sources impact ambient PM2.5 the most 
within the source region itself. For example, local emissions from these three combustion 
sources in Central Africa contribute 49% of the annual average surface ambient PM2.5 within 
that region (Figure 2c), but <10% in the other four African regions. Emissions in Central 
Africa have the largest local impact on ambient PM2.5. The contribution of local emissions 
from these three sources on annual-average ambient PM2.5 concentrations over North Africa 
is the smallest (2%), and this is in part due to the large contribution of dust to ambient PM2.5 
and likely due to a lower population density across the Sahara Desert, which contributes to 
lower emissions in this region.
The impacts of emissions from one region on the annual-average ambient PM2.5 in another 
region depends strongly on meteorology. For example, these three combustion sources in 
East Africa contribute 20% of the annual-average ambient PM2.5 over Central Africa. This 
phenomenon is likely due to the trade winds at these latitudes primarily blowing from East to 
West. Consistent with this, these three combustion sources in Central Africa contribute only 
5% of the annual average ambient PM2.5 within East Africa. These three sources in Central 
Africa contribute 8% of ambient PM2.5 concentrations in the Southern African region due to 
the close proximity of the Southern Africa region to open BB in the southern portion of the 
Central Africa region.
3.3.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Trash Burning
The contribution of trash burning to annual average ambient PM2.5 in each region of Africa 
is shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1 and summarized in Table 2. Of the 
three sources investigated here, trash burning contributes the least to annual-average 
ambient PM2.5 (Table 2). Southern Africa contributes the largest percentage of ambient 
PM2.5 from trash burning (1.5% in Southern Africa) followed by East Africa (1.2% in 
East Africa). Although the regional percentages are small, highly populated regions of 
Africa can experience high local ambient PM2.5 contributions from this source. Kodros 
et al. (2016) estimated that the local percent changes of ambient PM2.5 from waste combus-
tion within Africa ranged from 0% to ∼30% in the year 2010. The range of our local percent 
changes (0%–30%) is the same despite using different emissions inventories. The invento-
ries are different because of the assumptions of waste/trash emissions of the CEDSGBD-MAPS 
(McDuffie et  al.,  2020) used in our study. Although CEDSGBD-MAPS incorporated the 
Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) waste combustion inventory, only 30% of generated waste was 
assumed to be combusted as opposed to 60%, as was used in Kodros et al. (2016). The 
reduction was based on a literature survey conducted to understand the fraction of resi-
dential waste that is combusted resulting in the assumption of 30% of uncollected waste is 
burnt by weight in CEDSGBD-MAPS (McDuffie et al., 2020).
Transported air pollution from trash burning had only minor impacts on ambient PM2.5 
concentrations outside of the region where the emissions originated from due to the small 
magnitude of this source. Consistent with the impacts of transport for all three combustion 
sources combined, trash emissions from East Africa have the largest relative impact on ambi-
ent PM2.5 in Central Africa, but even this impact is minor (∼0.3% of annual average ambient 
PM2.5).

3.4.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Residential Solid-Fuel Burning
The contribution of residential solid biofuel burning to annual-average ambient PM2.5 is shown in Figure S4 in 
Supporting Information S1 and summarized in Table 2. Residential combustion is the second largest contributor 
to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 (5%) over Africa when compared to trash (1%) and open BB (22%). 
Residential combustion in East Africa makes the largest local contribution to annual-average surface ambient 
PM2.5 (9% in East Africa) followed by Central Africa (2% in Central Africa). Emissions from this source make 
only a minor contribution (1%) to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 in North Africa. The largest changes in 
regions outside of a source region due to transport were again from emissions in East Africa, where East Africa 
contributes 2% and 1% of the annual average ambient PM2.5 over Central Africa and Southern Africa, respectively.
3.5.  Ambient PM2.5 Impacts for Open BB
Maps showing the contribution of open BB to annual-average ambient PM2.5 in Africa are displayed in Figure 
S5 in Supporting Information S1 with the percentage changes summarized in Table 2. Of the three sources 
investigated here, open BB in Africa makes the largest contribution to annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 
across Africa (22%) and globally (5%). Across all the regions, open BB in Central Africa makes the largest local 
contribution to annual-average ambient PM2.5 (45% in Central), followed by meaningful contributions in East 
(21% in East) and Southern Africa (15% in Southern). In contrast, the contribution is much smaller over West 
(5% in West) and North Africa (1% in North). Roberts et al. (2009) reported that most open BB in Africa occurs 
in woodland regions, which is the land cover type primarily found in Central Africa.
Compared to the other two combustion sources, open BB emissions makes a larger contribution to annual-average 
surface ambient PM2.5 concentrations outside of individual source regions. For example, turning off open BB 
emissions in Central Africa decreased ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Southern Africa by 8%, and turning off 
emissions in East Africa reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations in Central Africa by 17%. Open BB has larger 
impacts because the emissions are greater than trash and residential solid-fuel combustion and because emissions 
from open BB may be lofted to outside of the planetary boundary layer resulting in a longer atmospheric lifetime, 
which increases the likelihood that they will be transported over longer distances (Paugam et al., 2016).
3.6.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality
The annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities attributable to emissions from all three combustion sources from 
each of the African regions and the entire continent are shown in Figure 3. Table 3 is similar to Table 2 but shows 
results for annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities, rather than changes in ambient PM2.5. Using our base-
case scenario, we find that there are 7.6 million (95% confidence interval: 5.3–9.4) annual PM2.5-attributable 
premature mortalities globally from the five causes of death explored here (see Section 2.2). Our global annual

global premature mortality estimates are similar to R. Burnett et al. (2018) of 8.9 million 
(7.5–10.3) and Lelieveld et  al.  (2020) of 8.8 million (7.11–10.41) deaths. Of these 7.6 
million PM2.5-attributable premature deaths, we find that 203,000 (95% confidence interval: 
133,000–259,000) annual global premature mortalities are attributable to emissions from the 
combination of three combustion sources in Africa, or 10% of total global ambient PM2.5 
premature mortalities. Of the 203,000 annual mortalities attributable to these three sources, 
167,000 of these annual mortalities are within the African continent, which represents 25% of 
total PM2.5 related premature mortalities in Africa. The PM2.5-attributable premature moral-
ities from these sources represent 2% of total annual PM2.5-related premature moralities in 
North Africa, 5% in Southern Africa, 10% in East Africa, 49% in West Africa, and 10% in 
Central Africa.
Following the changes in ambient PM2.5, we found that annual PM2.5-attributable prema-
ture mortalities were mainly driven by emissions within their own region, while transported 
ambient PM2.5 to the surrounding regions resulted in fewer premature mortalities. The largest 
ambient PM2.5 emissions are in West Africa, and these led to the highest number of local 
mortalities when considering all three combustion sources, that is, 43,000 PM2.5-attributable 
mortalities per year in this region. In contrast, Central Africa also has a large number of 
annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities (35,000 mortalities per year) despite the fact that these 
three combustion sources are responsible for larger contributions to ambient PM2.5, compared 
to other regions. This is due to the larger population numbers. Further, despite contributing to 
a relatively large percent of ambient PM2.5 in Southern Africa, these three sources only cause 
9,000 annual PM2.5-attributable deaths in the region.
3.7.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Trash Burning
The map of our estimates of premature mortalities attributed to trash-burning ambient PM2.5 
is shown in Figure S6 in Supporting Information S1 with results summarized in Table 3. We 
find that 11,200 premature mortalities are attributable to ambient PM2.5 from trash combus-
tion across Africa. Of the five regions, the largest number of PM2.5-attributable premature 
mortalities occurs in North Africa (∼5,000 deaths). Kodros et al. (2016) attributed 19,000 
premature adult mortalities to waste combustion PM2.5 in Africa for the year of 2010. This 
estimate is relatively close to the premature mortalities found in our study. These are a few 
differences in the emissions inventories used between the two studies and they also used a 
different concentration-response function. On the other hand, when we compared our esti-
mates to McDuffie et al. (2021) which also used CEDSGBD-MAPS, our estimates are close to 
their premature mortality estimates of 16,000 deaths. Although McDuffie et al. (2021) used 
the same inventory and GEMM concentration-response function, they attributed premature 
mortality estimates to six causes of premature death (IHD, stroke, COPD, LC, LRI, and type 
II diabetes), whereas we use five causes of death for all age groups in our estimates.
3.8.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Residential Burning
We attribute 49,000 annual premature mortalities to ambient PM2.5 from residential solid-
fuel burning in Africa. The regional map of premature mortalities attributed to this source of 
ambient PM2.5 is shown in Figure S7 in Supporting Information S1. Residential combustion 
contributes to the fewest number of PM2.5-attributable mortalities in Southern Africa. On the 
other hand, residential combustion leads to the most premature mortalities in West Africa 
(21,700 mortalities per year). The relatively large population in this region contributes to 
the higher mortality estimates. The effect of population is evident between the contrast of 
Table 2 with Table 3. When residential biofuel burning was removed in West Africa PM2.5 
concentrations were only reduced by 3% within the region (second smallest of any region's 
self-effect). However, this removal led to the most premature mortalities within the source 
region of any of the five regions. The West Africa region is one of the largest populated 
regions in Africa.

3.9.  PM2.5-Attributable Mortality From Open BB
Following the effects on ambient PM2.5 concentrations, open BB contributes to the largest number of annual 
PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities (Figure S8 in Supporting Information S1, Table 3). In Africa, this source 
amounts to 106,200 annual premature mortalities, and outside of Africa, it amounts to 20,500 annual premature 
mortalities. Bauer et al. (2019) estimated that open BB leads to 43,000 annual premature deaths in Africa, which 
is lower than our findings. We found that emissions from open BB in Central Africa lead to the largest number of 
annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities within that region (31,000 in Central Africa), and contribute to the largest 
number of PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities across all of Africa (48,300 mortalities per year). Open BB 
in West Africa leads to the second largest number of annual PM2.5-attributable mortalities across the continent, 
with 18,700 in West Africa and 19,900 across all of Africa. Additionally, compared to the other regions, open BB 
in East Africa leads to the largest number of PM2.5-attributable mortalities outside of Africa (8,800 mortalities 
per year).
While previous studies have not investigated all three of these three sources in Africa directly, several studies 
have looked at similar sectors or have included one or more of these sources in health-impact assessments. 
Lacey et al. (2017) estimated 13,210 annual premature deaths from anthropogenic activity (including trans-
portation, household energy generation, waste burning, and home heating and cooking but not open BB) in 
Africa by implementing the Diffuse and Inefficient Combustion Emissions in Africa (DICE-Africa) (Marais & 
Wiedinmyer, 2016) and the 2010 Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutant emissions inventories for 2006. The 
Lacey et al. (2017) study used the Integrated Exposure-Response model (IER) (R. T. Burnett et al., 2014) that 
incorporates relative risk information from ambient air pollution, second tobacco smoke, household solid fuel 
for cooking, and active smoking to estimate premature mortalities for five causes of death including IHD, stroke, 
COPD, and LC. The IER generally produces lower PM2.5-attributable mortality estimates than the GEMM func-
tion that we used in this study. Hence, these lower annual premature mortality estimates from Lacey et al. (2017) 
attributed to anthropogenic activity may be due to the use of this IER model in addition to not including BB. On 
the other hand, Bauer et al. (2019) estimated 780,000 premature deaths annually from PM2.5 from desert dust, 
all anthropogenic activity, and BB in Africa for 2016. In the terms of premature mortalities due to fossil-fuel 
combustion in Africa (not covered in our study), Vohra et al. (2021) calculated 194,000 premature mortalities 
annually in Africa due to fossil-fuel combustion from power generation, industry, ships, aircraft, ground trans-
portation, backup generators, kerosene, and oil/gas extraction for the year 2012. Marais et al. (2019) attributed 
79,000 premature deaths from exposure to ambient PM2.5 fossil fuel use from 2015 emissions in Africa. None of 
these studies are directly comparable to ours due to factors such as differences in sources investigated, emissions 
inventories, atmospheric models, and concentration-response functions. However, despite these differences, the 
estimated number of annual PM2.5-related premature mortalities provided here are similar in magnitude, support-
ing the validity of our results.
4.  Conclusion
We use the GEOS-Chem chemical-transport model to estimate the annual-average surface ambient PM2.5 concen-
trations and annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities from three combustion sources (trash burning, resi-
dential solid-fuel use, and open BB) across Africa for 2017. We estimate the impacts of these three combustion 
sources across five regions of Africa (as defined by the GBD), including both the impacts of emissions from 
each region to each of the African regions as well as outside of Africa. Via a set of sensitivity simulations, we 
show that these sources lead to 203,000 annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities globally and 167,000 
annual premature mortalities in Africa. Ambient PM2.5 from these three combustion sources leads to a substan-
tial number of premature mortalities in Africa compared to the deaths from communicable diseases, such as the 
Ebola Virus (∼11,000 deaths from 2014 to 2016) (Bell, 2016). To our knowledge there are very few health impact 
assessments in this region of the world that are focused on the three combustion sources we examined here.
Overall, the largest impact of PM2.5 emissions occurs in the region of Africa where the emissions occur. However, 
emissions from some regions have substantial impacts on neighboring regions. For example, in East Africa these 
three combustion sourced had substantial impacts on PM2.5 concentrations in Central Africa due to the predom-
inant East-West wind patterns in the tropics. Of the three sources, open BB has the largest impact on ambient 
PM2.5 and annual PM2.5-attributable premature mortalities in Africa (106,000 per year), followed by residential 
solid-fuel combustion (49,000 per year), and trash combustion (11,000 per year).

Overall, Africa has a unique ambient air pollution profile because sources such as windblown dust and BB 
contribute strongly to PM2.5 levels and PM2.5-related mortality. Although open BB has the largest health impacts, 
this source is probably one of the most difficult of three sources to control or regulate in Africa. Trash and 
residential solid-fuel emissions may be mitigated more easily through financial investments in municipal trash 
collection programs and/or assistance programs that help finance conversions from residential solid-fuel use to 
electric stoves (as well as electrification of rural/remote African regions in general).

Abstract
Uncontrolled combustion of domestic waste has been observed in many countries, creating concerns
for air quality; however, the health implications have not yet been quantiﬁed. We incorporate the
Wiedinmyer et al (2014 Environ. Sci. Technol. 48 9523–30) emissions inventory into the global
chemical-transport model, GEOS-Chem, and provide a ﬁrst estimate of premature adult mortalities
from chronic exposure to ambient PM2.5 from uncontrolled combustion of domestic waste. Using the
concentration-response functions (CRFs) of Burnett et al (2014 Environ. Health Perspect. 122
397–403), we estimate that waste-combustion emissions result in 270 000 (5th–95th:
213 000–328 000) premature adult mortalities per year. The conﬁdence interval results only from
uncertainty in the CRFs and assumes equal toxicity of waste-combustion PM2.5 to all other PM2.5
sources. We acknowledge that this result is likely sensitive to choice of chemical-transport model,
CRFs, and emission inventories. Our central estimate equates to 9% of adult mortalities from
exposure to ambient PM2.5 reported in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. Exposure to PM2.5
from waste combustion increases the risk of premature mortality by more than 0.5% for greater than
50% of the population. We consider sensitivity simulations to uncertainty in waste-combustion
emission mass, the removal of waste-combustion emissions, and model resolution. A factor-of-2
uncertainty in waste-combustion PM2.5 leads to central estimates ranging from 138 000 to 518 000
mortalities per year for factors-of-2 reductions and increases, respectively. Complete removal of waste
combustion would only avoid 191 000 (5th–95th: 151 000–224 000) mortalities per year (smaller than
the total contributed premature mortalities due to nonlinear CRFs). Decreasing model resolution
from 2°×2.5° to 4°×5° results in 16% fewer mortalities attributed to waste-combustion PM2.5,
and over Asia, decreasing resolution from 0.5°×0.666° to 2°×2.5° results in 21% fewer mortalities
attributed to waste-combustion PM2.5. Owing to coarse model resolution, our global estimates of
premature mortality from waste-combustion PM2.5 are likely a lower bound.
1. Introduction
Open, uncontrolled combustion of domestic waste
(i.e. trash burning) occurs on a global scale, emitting
particulate matter (PM) and toxic gaseous and parti-
culate compounds (Christian et al 2010, Wiedinmyer
et al 2014). Domestic waste can include food and
agricultural products, containers and packaging, and
other sources of residential trash. Combustion occurs
both in homes and at community waste sites (i.e.
dumps), and both in developing and developed
countries,

widespread in developing countries (Wiedinmyer
et al 2014). While combustion of waste is ubiquitous in
rural areas, there are also signiﬁcant emissions in
urban areas, potentially leading to pollution exposure
of dense populations (Wiedinmyer et al 2014).
Until recently, inventories of pollutant emissions
from combustion processes either did not include
emissions from uncontrolled domestic-waste com-
bustion (e.g. Bond et al 2007, Janssens-Maenhout
et al 2010), or the domestic-waste-combustion emis-
sions were assumed to be low relative to other sources
in all locations (Bond et al 2004). However, Wie-
dinmyer et al (2014) recently created an emissions
inventory focused speciﬁcally on the emissions from
the uncontrolled open combustion of domestic-waste
products. The total estimated PM2.5 emissions were
10 Tg yr−1, globally, an order of magnitude higher
than a previous estimate in Bond et al (2004), and
similar to the emissions from biofuel combustion in
Bond et al (2004). The more-recent estimates were
higher due to newer assumptions in waste production,
fraction burned, and emission factors. The largest dri-
ver of the difference in emissions was the estimated
amount of annual waste burned: Bond et al (2004) esti-
mated a total of 33 Tg, while Wiedinmyer et al (2014)
predict 970 Tg. This discrepancy is in part due to the
assumption in Bond et al (2004) that no waste com-
bustion occurs in rural developing countries. Thus,
ambient air quality particularly in developing coun-
tries may be substantially impacted by domestic-waste
combustion.
PM air pollution is a major contributor to the Glo-
bal Burden Of Disease (GBD), and the most important
environmental contributor to morbidity and mortal-
ity in the world (Lim et al 2012). Thus, exposure to
ambient pollution from uncontrolled domestic-waste
combustion may have serious health implications, yet
these health effects have not been quantiﬁed. A num-
ber of past studies have linked exposure to ambient
PM with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 μm
(PM2.5) to increased risk of mortality for adults
from ischaemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular
disease (CeVD, or stroke), chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), and lung cancer (LC)
(Pope et al 2002, Laden et al 2006, Krewski et al
2009, Burnett et al 2014). Using a combination of
satellite and ground observations, and chemical-trans-
port models to estimate PM2.5 exposure from all
sources, the GBD Study 2010 estimated 3.1 million
premature
mortalities,
globally,
in
2010
(Lim
et al 2012).
For global/regional scale studies, chemical-trans-
port models have been used to estimate surface-level
ambient PM2.5 exposure for use in health-impact
assessments (e.g. Anenberg et al 2010, Lelieveld
et al 2013, 2015, Butt et al 2016). Despite uncertainties
in emissions and atmospheric processes, models have
an advantage over ground-based measurements in
that they provide exposure estimates in regions where
few surface measurements are available. In addition,
models can provide source-speciﬁc PM2.5 estimates,
thereby allowing for policy-relevant mortality esti-
mates from speciﬁc emission sectors (e.g. Corbett
et al 2007, Butt et al 2016). Recently, Lelieveld et al
(2015) used the ECHAM model to estimate source-
speciﬁc mortalities, ﬁnding dominant sources in Asia
are from residential solid-fuel combustion and bio-
mass burning; however, this study does not include
emissions from open waste combustion.
One potential drawback of using chemical-trans-
port models on a global scale is that computational
efﬁciency often limits model spatial resolution.
Lower-resolution global models average PM2.5 con-
centrations over larger areas, limiting the ability to
predict very-polluted regions and sharp gradients out-
side these regions. As emissions are often co-located
with population, this may lead to a dependence of
mortality estimates on model resolution. Punger and
West (2013) estimated ambient PM2.5 mortalities in
the United States using different model resolutions,
and ﬁnd substantially (∼30%) lower estimates when
scaling PM2.5 to spatial scales representative of global
models (>250 km) relative to 12 km. One method to
correct for sub-grid scale gradients involves using
satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) at resolutions
higher than the model (e.g. ∼10 km versus ∼200 km)
to interpolate PM2.5 exposure ﬁelds at the resolution
of the satellite AOD. However, this method relies on
the ratio of modeled AOD to surface PM2.5 (van Don-
kelaar et al 2015). Ford and Heald (2016) estimated
20% uncertainty in mortality due to methodology in
estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations from satellite
AOD. Additionally, while this method was used in sev-
eral studies to estimate all-source PM2.5 mortality
(Lim et al 2012, Evans et al 2013), satellite observations
cannot be used to isolate individual sources of PM2.5;
one would need to assume that spatial distribution of
AOD from each individual source follows the spatial
distribution of the total AOD.
In this study, we provide the ﬁrst estimates of mor-
tality due to chronic exposure to PM2.5 from domes-
tic-waste
combustion.
We
include
the
recent
Wiedinmyer et al (2014) waste-combustion inventory
into the global/regional chemical-transport model,
GEOS-Chem. In section 2, we discuss the model setup
and
methodology
for
estimating
mortality.
In
section 3.1, we present model results for waste-com-
bustion PM2.5 and in section 3.2 we present the global
and country-level attributed mortality. In section 3.3,
we estimate the deaths averted due to complete
removal of emissions. In section 3.4, we test the sensi-
tivity of mortality rates to uncertainties in emission
mass and model resolution. We share our conclusions
in section 4. In a separate study, Kodros et al (2016), we
estimate the aerosol radiative impacts from domestic-
waste combustion.

2. Methods
2.1. Chemical-transport model overview
To estimate PM2.5 concentrations, we use the Goddard
Earth Observing System chemical-transport model
(GEOS-Chem) version 10.01. GEOS-Chem is driven
by GEOS-5 assimilated meteorology ﬁelds (http://
gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov), and includes PM tracers for black
carbon, organic aerosol, dust, sea salt, sulfate, nitrate,
and ammonium in addition to 52 gas-phase species.
Globally, we use the EDGAR emissions inventory with
regional overwrites as described in the supplemental
material.
Waste-combustion
emissions
are
not
included in these base GEOS-Chem emissions inven-
tories. We incorporate to GEOS-Chem the waste-
combustion inventory of Wiedinmyer et al (2014),
which estimates the mass of waste burned in urban
and rural areas for developing countries, and rural
areas for developed countries. The inventory primarily
uses emission factors compiled in Akagi et al (2011).
Estimated
waste-combustion
emissions
include
0.6 Tg yr−1 of black carbon and 5.1 Tg yr−1 of primary
organic carbon, as well as more-minor contributions
from gas-phase species including sulphur dioxide,
ammonia, and nitrous oxides, which contribute to
additional PM2.5 (<10% of the total addition) through
chemical reactions. Evaluation of the modeled aerosol
burden withand without waste-combustion emissions
is included in the supplemental material.
We perform GEOS-Chem simulations for year
2010 with a pair of simulations: one with emissions
from all sources (including waste burning; ‘WAS-
TE_ON’), and another, otherwise-identical simula-
tion
but
without
waste-combustion
emissions
(‘WASTE_OFF’). Comparison of these pairs of simu-
lations allows us to isolate the impacts of waste com-
bustion on PM2.5 concentrations and mortality. In
order to test the sensitivity of mortality rates to uncer-
tainties in waste-combustion emission mass, we
assume waste-combustion PM2.5 scales linearly with
PM emission mass and simply double (‘HIGHMASS’)
and half (‘LOWMASS’) modeled waste-combustion
PM2.5 concentrations. The factor-of-2 uncertainty in
emission mass is similar to uncertainties in waste-
combustion emission factors reported in Akagi et al
(2011). In order to test the sensitivity of mortality rates
to model resolution we repeat the WASTE_ON and
WASTE_OFF simulations at three resolutions: 2°×
2.5° (∼200 km) and 4°×5° (∼400 km) resolution
globally, and a 0.5°×0.666° (∼50 km) resolution
over Asia.
2.2. Calculation of premature mortality
Our methodology to estimate mortalities from waste-
combustion PM2.5 is based on the methods used in the
GBD 2010 to estimate ambient PM2.5 mortalities. We
discuss a number of uncertainties and limitations of
this method in section 4. We use year 2010 gridded
population (from the NASA Socioeconomic Data
and Application Center (SEDAC, http://sedac.ciesin.
columbia.edu/) and baseline mortality rates compiled
for the GBD 2013 for IHD, CeVD, COPD, and LC for
adults (ages greater than 25) (Naghavi et al 2015).
Baseline mortalities are reported at the country level,
and we aggregate them to the model resolution
assuming no sub-national gradients. Data on baseline
mortality variability at a sub-national scale were not
available.
The fraction of all premature mortalities due only
to PM2.5 is based on concentration-response functions
(CRFs) that relate exposure to ambient PM2.5 to
increased risk of premature mortality from speciﬁc
diseases. We calculate the relative risk (RR) from all
PM2.5 sources (RRtotal) using the integrated CRFs of
Burnett et al (2014). We choose the Burnett et al (2014)
study as it uses smoking and household air pollution
to constrain the risk at high PM2.5 concentrations
(such as ambient PM2.5 found in India and China).
The Burnett et al (2014) study makes several assump-
tions relevant to this study: the toxicity of PM2.5 is
not dependent on composition, increased mortality
risk is a result of long-term exposure, CRFs apply glob-
ally, there exists a minimum PM2.5 threshold (mod-
eled as a uniform distribution ranging from 5.8
to 8.8 μg m−3) below which no further negative
health impacts are assumed to occur, and the relation-
ship between relative risk of mortality and PM2.5 expo-
sure is nonlinear. We note that CRFs are an active area
of research, and our results are likely sensitive to our
choice of CRF. Burnett et al (2014) ﬁts coefﬁcients
using a Monte Carlo approach, reporting 1000 sets of
coefﬁcients for each cause (and each age group for
CeVD and IHD). We use these sets of coefﬁcients
to determine median, 5th, and 95th percentiles of
mortality. The attributable fraction of premature mor-
talities by PM2.5 is then calculated from the RR by:
(RRtotal−1)/RRtotal.
We estimate total premature adult mortality from
PM2.5 as the product of population, cause and age spe-
ciﬁc baseline mortality rates, and attributable fraction
from all PM2.5 sources in each model gridcell. We esti-
mate 2.7 million premature adult mortalities from
ambient PM2.5 in the 2°×2.5°-resolution simulation
(ﬁgure S1). This number is lower than estimates of 3.1
million from Lelieveld et al (2015) and Lim et al (2012);
however, it is within the reported uncertainty ranges
(2.5 to 3.7 million for Lim et al 2012 and 1.5 to 4.6 mil-
lion for Lelieveld et al 2015). The coarser resolution of
our global model likely contributes to the lower
estimate.
To attribute the number of mortalities owing to
waste-combustion emissions, we scale total mortalities
from all PM2.5 by the fraction of PM2.5 from waste
combustion (attribution method). This is represented
by equation (1):

and Mall (WASTE_ON) is the premature mortalities due

tionally, we estimate the number of mortalities averted
due to removal of waste-combustion emissions by
subtracting the total mortalities in the WASTE_OFF
simulation from the total mortalities in the WAS-
TE_ON simulation (subtraction method). This is

3. Results
3.1. Model increases in PM2.5 due to waste-
combustion emissions
Figure 1 shows the absolute increase (panel a) and
percent increase (panel b) in PM2.5 from waste-
combustion emissions at 2°×2.5° model resolution.
Waste-combustion emissions lead to over 10%
increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations in South
and South-East Asia, Eastern Europe, Central America
and Coastal South America. Notably, PM2.5 increases
by more than 40% in Sri Lanka and central Mexico
(e.g. Mexico City). The absolute increases in PM2.5 are
greatest in eastern China and northern India, but there
are anomalously large fractional increases in grid cells
corresponding to large urban areas such as Johannes-
burg, Cairo, Moscow, and Mexico City.
3.2. Global and country-level mortality rates due to
waste-combustion PM2.5
The mortality rates per area associated with waste-
combustion PM2.5 calculated through the attribution
method are shown in ﬁgure 2(a), and global annual
mortalities listed by cause of death are in table 1. We
attribute waste-combustion PM2.5 to 270 000 (5th–
95th:213 000–328 000) adult mortalities per year (cal-
culated as the sum of IHD, CeVD, COPD, and LC).
The majority of these mortalities are caused by IHD
(120 000,
5th–95th:106 000–136 000)
and
CeVD
(108 000, 5th–95th:86 000–130 000). Spatially, the
highest concentration of deaths occurs in eastern
China and northern India where mortality exceeds
900 deaths per 104 km2 (a 100×100 km box) per
year. There is also a substantial number of mortalities
in Eastern Europe. Signiﬁcant increases in PM2.5 co-
located with dense populations lead to greater than
300 deaths per 104 km2 in densely populated cities.
Figure 2(c) shows the waste combustion mortality rate
per 106 people (in each grid cell). A combination of
large relative PM2.5 increases and high baseline
mortality rates in Eastern Europe and Russia lead to a
similar mortality rate as in Asia. Figure 2(c) also shows
more widespread health impacts in Africa and the
Middle East, where lower population densities limit
the total number of annual mortalities.
At the country level, the estimated premature
mortality rates due to waste-burning PM2.5 (normal-
ized either by population or area) varies by several
orders of magnitude between regions and economic
level (see supplemental table 1). This mortality range is
due to (1) differing amounts of waste generation (and
hence emissions) and pollution transport leading to
differing PM2.5 concentrations, (2) large variations in
total number and density of the exposed population,
and (3) differences in baseline mortality rates. In addi-
tion, non-waste-combustion PM2.5 plays an impor-
tant role. In both WASTE_ON and WASTE_OFF,
some countries are uniformly below the minimum
concentration threshold set as the counterfactual in
Figure 1. The (a) absolute difference and (b) percent difference in modeled boundary layer PM2.5 from including emissions from

we note that the actual minimum concentration
threshold has not been clearly identiﬁed in the litera-
ture). By aggregating mortalities to the country level,
we ﬁnd the countries with the largest total mortalities
due to waste combustion are China, India, Pakistan,
and Russia. These four countries amount to 78% of
the global mortality. The countries with the highest
mortalities per capita are Montenegro, Bulgaria, Mol-
dova, and Ukraine. Normalizing by mass of waste
generated, we ﬁnd that the countries with the highest
mortalities per mass of waste generated are Nepal,
Montenegro, Uruguay, and Bulgaria (supplemental
table 1). Supplemental ﬁgure S4 shows box-and-whis-
ker plots of country-level generated waste per capita

countries generate two times more waste, only 10 peo-
ple die for every Tg of waste generated compared to 82
deaths for every Tg of waste generated in low- to
upper-middle-income countries. This difference is
driven by a higher fraction of waste generated being
burned in low- to upper-middle income countries
compared to high-income countries.
3.3. Deaths averted due to removal of waste-
combustion emissions
We estimate 191 000 (5th–95th:51 000–224 000) pre-
mature mortalities per year may be saved by eliminat-
ing waste combustion (subtraction method; see
explanation in section 2.2) (table 1 and ﬁgure S6).
Thus, removing waste combustion would reduce
premature mortality rates by a smaller number than
the mortality rate attributed to waste combustion. This
is due to the nonlinear CRFs where the mortality
response to PM2.5 saturates with increasing PM2.5
concentrations. This saturation effect is strongest in
the heavily polluted regions of India and China (which
lie on the sub-linear portion of the CRF). This
saturation effect is partly balanced out by a larger
number of mortalities avoided in cleaner regions
where waste-combustion emissions elevates PM2.5
concentrations from below to above minimum-
PM2.5-threshold values.
3.4. Sensitivity of mortality rates to emission mass
and model resolution
Wiedinmyer et al (2014) acknowledges large uncer-
tainties in PM2.5 emission mass. To test the sensitivity
of mortality rates to uncertainties in emission mass, we
introduce a factor-of-2 uncertainty in waste-combus-
tion PM2.5 mass. Halving waste-combustion PM2.5
(LOWMASS)
results
in
138 000
(5th–
95th:109 000–167 000) mortalities per year and dou-
bling PM2.5 (HIGHMASS) results in 518 000 (5th–
95th:410 000–626 000)
through
the
attribution
method (table 1 and ﬁgure S5). The relationship
between waste-combustion PM2.5 and mortality is
sub-linear (additional PM2.5 impacts health less when
PM2.5 concentrations are already high) because many
of the waste-combustion source regions occur in
already heavily polluted areas; thus, the waste-com-
bustion emissions in these regions lead to fewer
mortalities than if PM2.5 concentrations were lower.
In order to explore the dependence on estimated
attributed mortality rates to model resolution, we use a
coarser 4°×5° and ﬁner 2°×2.5° global simulation
and a 0.5°×0.666° simulation over Asia. The total
number of annual mortalities in the global 4°×5°
resolution simulation is 16% lower than the 2°×2.5°
resolution simulation (table 1 and ﬁgure S7). The
decrease in mortality rates with coarser resolution is
caused by two main factors. First, as grid-box area
increases, ambient PM2.5 is averaged over a larger area
and may reduce concentrations below the minimum
threshold for mortality (between 5.8 and 8.8 μg m−3)
in some locations. Second, higher-resolution simula-
tions are better able to co-locate dense urban popula-
tions with PM2.5 increases from waste combustion.
Figure 2(b) shows the annual mortality per 104 km2
and ﬁgure 2(d) shows annual mortality per 106 people
over Asia at 0.5°×0.666° resolution. In this domain,
total
mortalities
increase
from
184 000
(5th–
95th:146 000–222 000) in the 4°×5°, to 221 000
(5th–95th:174 000–266 000) in the 2°×2.5°, to
279 000
(5th–95th:221 000–336 000)
in
the
0.5°×0.666° resolution simulation. The higher-
resolution simulation predicts more mortalities just in
the Asia domain than the 2°×2.5° simulation pre-
dicts globally, which highlights the importance of
model resolution when using simulated PM2.5 con-
centrations to estimate mortality rates.
Figure 3 shows the fractions of the population
impacted by waste-combustion PM2.5 and mortality
risk. Figure 3(a) shows the complementary cumulative
distribution functions (CCDF) of the percent of the
global population exposed to different levels of PM2.5
from domestic-waste combustion. In the global
2°×2.5° domain, 50% of the total population is
exposed to a greater than 1.3 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5
from waste combustion, while 10% is exposed to a
greater than 5.3 μg m−3 increase. Increases in expo-
sure due to waste-combustion PM2.5 are generally
smaller in the coarser 4°×5° domain due to dilution
of emissions into larger grid cells. Figure 3(b) shows
the corresponding CCDFs for the relative increase in
PM2.5-mortality risk in the WASTE_ON compared to
the WASTE_OFF simulation. The all-cause relative
risk is the mean value of the relative risk of the four
causes weighted by the proportion of each cause to the
total baseline mortality. For the two global resolutions,
more than 50% of the population has greater than a
0.5% increased risk of mortality by any cause due to
waste-combustion emissions, while 10% of the popu-
lation has a greater than 1.5% increased risk of mortal-
ity. While in ﬁgure 3(a) 91% of the population is
exposed to at least a 0.1 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5, only
75% of the population has a greater than 0.02%
increased risk of mortality in ﬁgure 3(b) (due to mini-
mum PM2.5 thresholds in the CRF). Figures 3(c) and
(d) show increased PM2.5 and increased risk of mortal-
ity in the Asian domain for the three model resolu-
tions. The majority of global mortalities occur in Asia
(table 1), where a larger fraction of the population is
exposed
to
waste-combustion
PM2.5
and
thus
increased risk of mortality. All three resolutions show
that nearly 99% of the population in Asia is exposed to
at least a 0.1 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 and nearly 83%
of the population have an greater than 0.02%
increased risk of mortality from waste combustion.
The 0.5° ×0.666° resolution simulation predicts that
a higher fraction of the population is exposed to larger
increases in PM2.5 and mortality risk than the coarser
resolutions due to the reasons discussed above.

4. Discussion and conclusions
As stated in the results, we estimate 270 000 (5th–
95th:213 000–328 000) annual adult mortalities from
waste combustion. Our estimate of mortality attribu-
ted to waste combustion is similar to recent estimates
of mortalities due to PM2.5 from solid-fuel cookstoves
(300 000–400 000 mortalities per year), another emis-
sion source associated with the developing world
(Chafe et al 2014, Butt et al 2016). Waste-combustion
emissions are approximately 10% of our total ambient
PM2.5 mortalities and 9% of the total ambient PM2.5
mortalities estimated in the GBD 2010. We note that
our estimate of global mortalities from waste-combus-
tion emissions are of a similar magnitude to the
Lelieveld et al (2015) estimate of mortalities from
PM2.5 from biomass burning (∼165 000), land trafﬁc
(∼165 000), and industrial emissions (∼231 000);
however, we note that our total mortality estimate is
10% lower than Lelieveld et al (2015).
Waste combustion has high mortality rates due to
proximity of emissions to population. In developing
countries, substantial amounts of waste combustion
can occur in urban areas. We ﬁnd high mortality den-
sities (>300 deaths per 104 km2 yr−1) in cities such as
Mexico City, Moscow, Johannesburg, and Rio de
Janeiro. Four countries (China, India, Pakistan, and
Russia) account for slightly more than 2/3 of the
global mortality burden due to waste combustion.
Globally, more than half of the world’s population is
exposed to an additional 1.3 μg m−3 of PM2.5 due to
waste combustion leading to a 0.5% increased risk of
mortality each year just from waste-combustion
emissions.
Due to a factor-of-2 uncertainty in PM2.5 emission
mass, we estimate a range of mortalities per year of
138 000 to 518 000. We note that even on the low end
of this range, waste combustion contributes to a sub-
stantial number (greater than 100 000) of mortalities
per year. Additionally, we estimate that a complete
removal of waste-combustion would avoid 191 000
mortalities per year (see explanation in section 2.2). In
these sensitivity simulations, the calculated decrease of
premature mortality is less than the proportional
decrease in PM2.5. The sub-linear nature of these sen-
sitivity tests demonstrates that most of the mortalities
from waste combustion occur in heavily polluted
areas.
Our estimates of premature mortality from waste-
combustion PM2.5 are likely a lower bound due to the
coarse resolution of the global model. Combustion of
domestic waste often occurs near where people live
and work, sometimes in streets or in front of homes,
and none of our model simulations resolve this near-
ﬁeld pollution exposure. The 2°×2.5° resolution is
unable to capture high PM2.5 gradients, which are

often co-located with dense populations. We include
an additional simulation at 4°×5° and calculate
227 000 mortalities (16% lower than the estimate at
2°×2.5°). This suggests increasing mortalities at pro-
gressively ﬁner model resolutions. Due to the high
mortality rates in Asia, we include a higher resolution
0.5°×0.666° simulation in this domain. We estimate
279 000 mortalities in Asia at this model resolution.
The sensitivity of health-response estimates to model
resolution has been explored in past studies (e.g.
Thompson and Selin 2012, Punger and West 2013).
The methods and data sources used here are simi-
lar to the GBD 2010 and several recent health-impact
studies (e.g. Lim et al 2012, Apte et al 2015, Lelieveld
et al 2015); however, there are substantial uncertain-
ties and limitations inherent in these methods. First,
the Burnett et al (2014) CRF is largely based on epide-
miologic studies that occur in the United States, and
while there are age modiﬁcation factors for CeVD and
IHD, there are no modiﬁcations for other socio-
demographc factors. We assume here that this func-
tion applies globally; however, as demographics and
pollution sources vary regionally, this may not be a
valid assumption. Second, we consider all species of
PM2.5 to be equally toxic; however, some studies have
suggested that combustion particles may be more
toxic (Krzyzanowski et al 2005). Third, due to lack of
data, baseline mortality rates used here are reported at
the national or regional level; however, demographics
often vary sub-nationally, and national and regional
level mortality rates may introduce uncertainty.
Chowdhury and Dey (2016) estimate 15% fewer pre-
mature mortalities from ambient PM2.5 exposure in
India when assuming a uniform country-level baseline
mortality rate as opposed to varying baseline mortality
at the state level using gross domestic product as a
proxy. The uncertainties listed here are in addition to
uncertainties in emissions (Akagi et al 2011, Wie-
dinmyer et al 2014) and model processes.
In this study, we focus on mortality from chronic
exposure to ambient PM2.5, but we note that waste
combustion also emits a number of gas- and particu-
late-phase toxins that may have additional signiﬁcant
health implications. While generally accepted that
these toxins have negative health impacts, the CRFs
are less well-developed making it difﬁcult to estimate a
global health impact. Thus, because PM2.5 response
functions exist, it is common to use PM2.5 estimates
as a proxy for exposure to a broad array of toxic
species. Therefore, the net health impacts from waste
combustion could be greater than estimates for
only PM2.5.
Uncontrolled domestic-waste-combustion emis-
sions are a potentially signiﬁcant emission source that
has been largely overlooked in past studies. Waste
combustion creates health-effect disparities between
high-income countries and lower-income countries,
where high-income countries generate more waste but
combust less, resulting in a factor of 8 fewer deaths per
mass waste of generated than lower-income countries
(ﬁgure S4). Due to the coarse model resolution and
exclusion of gaseous toxic species, our estimate of
mortalities from waste-combustion emissions is likely
a lower bound. Despite this, we ﬁnd a substantial bur-
den of disease (9% of mortalities from all PM2.5) that
are on the same order of magnitude as modeling esti-
mates of industry, land trafﬁc, and biomass burning.
Waste combustion also affects aerosol number con-
centrations and radiative impacts, and we explore this
in a separate study (Kodros et al 2016).

Abstract
Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that biomass open-burning (BOB) related air pollution has been associ­
ated with adverse health effect, but limited evidence is found in Thailand. We investigated the effects of BOB occurrence 
on outpatient department (OPD) visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Thailand and further explored the 
effects of longer exposure duration and higher exposure intensity to BOB. Fire hotspot data were acquired from the Vis­
ible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) 
satellite during January 2016 through December 2020 across Thailand, and OPD visits data were obtained from the 
National Health Security Office during the same period. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic 
regression was used to examine province-specific estimates of BOB-related air pollution on OPD visits, controlling for 
many possible confounders, and random-effect meta-analysis was then applied to derive the national estimate. Odds ratio 
(ORs) of cardiovascular and respiratory OPD visits on the day of BOB occurrence was 1.0105 (95% CI: 0.9971, 1.0240) 
at lag 5 days and 1.0131 (95% CI: 1.0050, 1.0213) at current day, respectively. ORs of cardiovascular and respiratory 
OPD visits associated with longer exposure duration to BOB was 1.0272 (95% CI: 1.0104, 1.0442) and 1.0275 (95% CI: 
1.0139, 1.0413), respectively. Higher exposure intensity to BOB was not significantly associated with OPD visits for both 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Findings from this study can be used to establish the warning systems associated 
with exposure to BOB-related air pollution to reduce adverse health effects in Thailand.

human health problems (Vichit-Vadakan and Vajanapoom 
2011). The various sources of air pollution in Thailand have 
been observed depending upon location, where traffic emis­
sion and biomass open burning (BOB) have been found 
as the major source of air pollution in Bangkok. Specifi­
cally, vehicle emission contributed to approximately 33% 
of PM10 and 32% of PM2.5 mass, whereas BOB contributed 
to approximately 33% of PM10 and 26% of PM2.5 mass at 
traffic locations (Chuersuwan et al. 2008). In Pathum Thani, 
an adjacent province of Bangkok, the two major sources of 
air pollution were vehicle emission and BOB as well. In 
particular, vehicle emission contributed to approximately 
28% and 27% of total PM2.5 mass during wet and dry sea­
son, respectively whereas 26% and 41% of total PM2.5 con­
centration was contributed from BOB during wet and dry 
season, respectively (Narita et al. 2019). The vegetation 
burning was also observed as the largest contributor to PM10 
concentration in Chiang Mai and Lamphun, the provinces 
in the northern part of Thailand, contributing to 46–82% 
of total PM10 concentration (Pengchai et al. 2009). There­
fore, BOB is considered as a significant source of air pol­
lution emission in Thailand (Yin et al. 2019) that generally 
increases the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CH4, CO, CO2, 
N2O and NO2 in the ambient air (Boonman et al. 2014). The 
potential sources of BOB that influence air quality are var­
ied in different regions of Thailand. Specifically, air pollu­
tion derived from BOB in the Northern region is originally 
emitted from the local residue burning activities (Kumar et 
al. 2020), whereas that in the Southern region is sometime 
likely to occur from the transboundary air pollution (Phairu­
ang et al. 2020).
A previous epidemiological study conducted in Malaysia 
has indicated that exposure to PM10 emitted from BOB was 
significantly associated with increased risk of non-accidental 
and respiratory mortality at various lag structures (Sahani et 
al. 2014) and the health impact assessment study conducted 
in Thessaloniki, Greece showed that PM2.5 emitted from 
BOB contributed to an increase of 200 premature deaths or 
3,540 years of life lost in 2012–2013 winter compared to the 
same period of 2011–2012, corresponding to the economic 
burden up to 1.2  billion euros (Sarigiannis et al. 2015). 
Furthermore, a previous study conducted in eight Northern 
provinces of Thailand, the region with the most serious air 
pollution situation contributed from BOB, revealed that an 
increase of 10 µg/m3 in PM10 concentration on the same day 
(lag 0) was associated with 2.00% (95% CI: 1.20, 2.80) and 
2.00% (95% CI: 0.40, 3.50) increased risk of outpatient vis­
its for chronic lower respiratory disease and cerebrovascular 
disease, respectively (Mueller et al. 2020). Although such 
studies examined the effect of BOB related air pollution on 
premature mortality, limited evidence on the effect of expo­
sure to BOB occurrence, as well as exposure duration and 
intensity to BOB related air pollution on human health is 
available in Thailand to date. Therefore, this study aimed to 
investigate the effects of short-term exposure to BOB occur­
rence on cardiovascular and respiratory outpatient depart­
ment (OPD) visits in Thailand. The risk of longer exposure 
duration and higher exposure intensity to BOB related air 
pollution on OPD visits was also examined.
2  Methods
Thailand consists of 77 administrative provinces. The total 
area of Thailand is approximately 500 km2 with roughly 
70 million populations in 2020. Thailand is divided into six 
regions according to the Thai Meteorological Department, 
including Northern, Northeastern, Central, Eastern, South­
ern East-Coast and Southern West-Coast (Fig.  1A). This 
study was conducted in 37 out of 77 provinces because of a 
limited air pollution and meteorological data (Fig. 1B).
2.1  Fire hotspot data
Fire hotspot data from the Fire Information for Resource 
Management System (FIRMS) distributes Near Real-Time 
(NRT) active fire data of satellite observations under the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
was used as the proxy of BOB in this study. In particular, fire 
hotspot data was acquired from the Visible Infrared Imag­
ing Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National 
Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, where 
the Suomi NPP VIIRS instrument has the overpass local 
time (LT) at around 1:00–3:00 PM LT with spatial resolu­
tion of 375 × 375 m2 (https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/
find-data/near-real-time/firms/viirs-i-band-375-m-active-
fire-data). Because of the quality of individual fire hotspot 
pixels is different depending upon the relative temperature 
anomaly and the potential sun glint contamination, this 
study considered only the nominal and high confidence fire 
hotspot pixels with vegetation burning point. The number 
of fire hotspot was then summed by date and province dur­
ing January 2016 through December 2020 and BOB occur­
rence day was defined when fire hotspot was detected in that 
particular day regardless how many fire hotspot counts was 
observed. Specifically, a day with active fire hotspot occur­
rence was assigned as 1, otherwise 0.
2.2  Air pollution and meteorological data
Hourly air pollution (particulate matter with aerodynamic 
diameter less than or equal to 10 μm: PM10 (µg/m3), nitro­
gen dioxide; NO2 (ppb), and ozone; O3 (ppb)) and meteo­
rological data (temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%)) 
1 3

was obtained from air quality monitoring stations operated 
by Thailand Pollution Control Department (PCD) under the 
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment during Jan­
uary 2016 through December 2020. Daily average concen­
tration of individual air pollutants, temperature, and relative 
humidity was calculated by taking the average of hourly data 
within the same day, but the day that had missing data more 
than 6 h was considered as missing. The missing of indi­
vidual air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity was 
then imputed using the expectation – maximization (EM) 
algorithm under the assumptions of a multivariate normal 
distribution (Junger and Ponce de Leon 2015). In case there 
are many monitoring stations situated in the same province, 
daily concentration of air pollutants, ambient temperature, 
and relative humidity from all available monitoring stations 
located in the same province were then averaged and uti­
lized as a proxy for daily exposure.
2.3  Outpatient department (OPD) visits data
Daily number of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respira­
tory disease was obtained from the National Health Security 
Office (NHSO) during the same period as of fire hotspot, air 
pollution, and weather variables. The OPD visits data under 
the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) scheme was consid­
ered in this study with anonymously recorded by age, sex, 
date of OPD visits, and primary diagnostic code according 
to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision 
(ICD-10), where I00-I99 has been coded for total cardio­
vascular disease and J00-J99 for total respiratory disease. 
This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of 
the Mahidol University Faculty of Public Health as research 
with exemption category (Protocol No. 145/2564).

Moreover, to examine the province-specific effect of longer 
exposure duration to BOB on OPD visits, a dummy variable 
of two or more consecutive day of fire hotspot occurrence 
was fitted in the conditional logistic regression model con­
trolling for temperature and relative humidity as shown in 
the following equation;
logit (Py=1i) = α + βi ∗DURt,i + ns (tmeant,i, df = 3) + ns (humidt,i, df = 3) + stratumt,i
(2)
Where DURt,i indicates the dummy variable for the longer 
duration of exposure to BOB at day t and province i, defined 
by two or more consecutive days of fire hotspot occurrence. 
Specifically, a day with two or more consecutive days of 
active fire hotspot occurrence at particular province was 
assigned as 1, otherwise 0. This method was used to inspect 
whether or not exposure to BOB related air pollutant for 
more than one day is associated with higher estimated effect 
on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases 
than that up to one day.
The province-specific effect of higher exposure intensity 
to BOB on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
disease was also investigated by fitting an indicator variable 
for higher exposure intensity to BOB, defined by daily aver­
age of province-specific PM10 concentration higher than the 
1st quartile (a priori) on the day of fire hotspot occurrence, 
in the conditional logistic regression model controlling for 
temperature and relative humidity as shown in the following 
equation;
logit (Py=1i) = α + βi ∗INTt,i + ns (tmeant,i, df = 3) + ns (humidt,i, df = 3) + stratumt,i
(3)
Where INTt,i represents an indicator variable of BOB inten­
sity at day t and province i. In particular, a day of fire hotspot 
occurrence coincided with daily concentration of PM10 
higher than 1st quartile was assigned as 1, otherwise 0.
The province-specific estimates of BOB on cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory OPD visits obtained from Eqs. (1), (2), 
and (3) were then pooled to derive the national estimate 
using the random-effect meta-analysis with restricted maxi­
mum likelihood (REML) estimation.

2.4  Statistical analysis
The time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional 
logistic regression was used to examine the province-spe­
cific association between BOB related air pollution and OPD 
visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In par­
ticular, this design generally takes into account comparison 
between case and control periods, where each case serves as 
his/her own control but in different periods of time (Maclure 
1991). In this study, exposure to BOB related air pollution 
at the date of OPD visits (case day) was compared with 
that in the same day of the week within the same calendar 
month of the same year (control days). This design is there­
fore automatically controlled for day of the week, long-term 
trend and seasonality by design that assumed to be constant 
within the same stratum. To explore province-specific effect 
of BOB occurrence on OPD visits, the indicator variable for 
of fire hotspot occurrence was fitted in the conditional logis­
tic regression model adjusting for temperature and relative 
humidity using the natural cubic spline function with three 
degrees of freedom at moving average lag 0–3 days for both 
temperature and relative humidity because previous studies 
purported that adjusting for temperature and relative humid­
ity at lag 0–3 days did not confound the estimates of the 
association between air pollution and health outcome (Lin 
et al. 2013; Thongphunchung et al. 2021). The maximum 
adequate model was selected based on minimizing Bayesian 
Information Criterion (BIC) value, in which three degrees 
of freedom of the natural cubic splines function for both 
temperature and relative humidity provided the lowest BIC 
value that was then used as the best model fit in this study 
(Table S1). The following equation was used to investigate 
the association between BOB related air pollution and OPD 
visits for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in this 
study.
logit (Py=1i) = α + βi ∗BOBt,i + ns (tmeant.i, df = 3) + ns (humidt,i, df = 3) + stratumt,i
(1)
Where logit(Py=1i) is the natural logarithm of odds ratio 
comparing case and control days within the same stratum 
at province i; α is the model intercept; BOBt,i is the indica­
tor variable of fire hotspot occurrence at day t and prov­
ince i ; βi is the coefficient of BOB occurrence associated 
with OPD visits at province i; ns(●) is the natural cubic 
splines function with three degrees of freedom; tmeant,i and 
humidt,i define daily mean temperature and relative humid­
ity at day t and province i, respectively; stratumt,i defines 
the case and control day within the same stratum t at prov­
ince i. The effect of BOB occurrence on OPD visits was 
examined until lag 7 days using unconstrained distributed 
lag model because the preliminary analysis indicated that 
the estimated effect was relatively constant after 7 days lag.

high exposure intensity compared to that in the days with 
low intensity (p-value < 0.001) (Table S3). The total number 
of OPD visits for cardiovascular disease over 37 provinces 
during the study period was 50,302,593 cases (Table  2), 
ranged from 266,955 cases in Mae Hong Son to 4,683,507 
cases in Bangkok, whereas that for respiratory disease 
was 46,845,417 cases with the minimum number of cases 
observed in Samut Songkhram (316,931 cases) and maxi­
mum number in Nakhon Ratchasima (4,092,245 cases). The 
prevalence rate of OPD visits for cardiovascular disease per 
1000 populations during the study period was 1,324, ranged 
from 825 in Bangkok to 2,772 in Phrae, whereas those for 
respiratory disease was 1,233, ranged from 412 in Bangkok 
to 1,836 in Yala (Table S4). There was an average of 399 
days that were assigned as longer exposure duration (a day 
with two or more consecutive days of active fire hotspot 
occurrence) during the study period. The daily average 
PM10 concentration for the days with longer exposure dura­
tion was 64.02 µg/m3 and daily mean number of OPD visits 
for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases was 883 and 769 
cases, respectively (Table S5). During the study period, 435 
days were assigned as higher exposure intensity with daily 
average PM10 concentration of 60.87 µg/ m3 and daily mean 
number of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases of 889 and 739 cases, respectively (Table S6).
The association between BOB occurrence and OPD vis­
its for cardiovascular and respiratory disease at different 
lag structures is shown in Fig. 2. The effect of BOB occur­
rence on cardiovascular OPD visits at national level was the 
highest at lag 5 days. In particular, the ORs of cardiovas­
cular OPD visits associated with BOB occurrence day was 
1.0105 (95% CI: 0.9971, 1.0240), compared to non-BOB 
occurrence day. The significant heterogeneity of the effect 
estimate among provinces was found with I2 of 99.3% and 
is within-province variance and τ2 indicates between-prov­
ince variance.
The sensitivity analysis was also performed by changing 
degree of freedom of the natural cubic spline function for 
temperature and relative humidity that were used as con­
founding factors on the association between BOB and OPD 
visits. The quartile cut-off point for defining higher expo­
sure intensity to BOB occurrence was also varied to explore 
the robustness of the effect estimates. The estimates of 
BOB occurrence and those of longer exposure duration and 
higher exposure intensity to BOB-related air pollution were 
also adjusted for other air pollutants by incorporating other 
air pollutants into the model one at a time. All analyses were 
performed using R packages for statistical computing (Ver­
sion 4.1.0), where “survival” and “splines” packages were 
used to analyse province-specific effect of BOB on OPD 
visits, whereas the “metafor” package was used to perform 
the random-effect meta-analysis. The result was presented 
as odds ratio (ORs) with its 95% confidence interval (CI).
3  Results
The average number of fire hotspot occurrence over 37 
provinces during the study period was 563 out of 1,827 
days (Table 1), ranged from 10 days in Samut Songkhram 
to 1,119 days in Nakhon Sawan (Table S2). Daily aver­
age concentration ± standard deviation (SD) of PM10, O3, 
and NO2 during the study period was 35.7 ± 22.4  µg/m3, 
36.8 ± 18.7 ppb, and 9.8 ± 6.2 ppb, respectively. Mean­
while, daily average temperature and relative humidity 
was 27.0 ± 7.7 oC and 71.6 ± 22.7%, respectively (Table 1). 
The spatial variations for fire hotspot and PM10 concentra­
tion during the study period are indicated in Fig. S1. The 
daily average PM10 concentration was significantly differ­
ent between the day with and without burning occurrence 
(p-value < 0.001), where higher concentration was observed 
in the days with fire hotspot occurrence. Similarly, PM10 
concentration was significantly different between 1-day 
exposure and longer exposure duration (p-value < 0.001). 
Moreover, PM10 concentration was higher in the days with

of OPD visits for cardiovascular disease with ORs of 1.0272 
(95% CI: 1.0104, 1.0442) (I2 = 99.4% and p-value from 
Cochran’s Q test < 0.001) and respiratory diseases with ORs 
of 1.0275 (95% CI: 1.0139, 1.0413) (I2 = 99.0% and p-value 
from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001). Nevertheless, we did not 
observe the significant effect of higher exposure intensity 
to BOB (daily average PM10 concentration higher than 
1st quartile on fire hotspot occurrence day) on OPD visits, 
where ORs of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respira­
tory diseases associated with exposure to higher intensity of 
BOB was 0.9828 (95% CI: 0.9641, 1.0018) (I2 = 99.4% and 
p-value from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001) and 0.9936 (95% CI: 
0.9831, 1.0049) (I2 = 97.8% and p-value from Cochran’s Q 
test < 0.001), respectively. The province-specific effects of 
longer exposure duration and higher exposure intensity to 
BOB related air pollution on OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory diseases are shown in Tables S8 and S9, 
respectively.
The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that the effects 
of exposure to BOB, as well as its longer duration and higher 
intensity, on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases were not different even when degrees of freedom 
of the natural cubic splines function for daily temperature 
and relative humidity was varied (Fig. 3 and Table S10). 
Furthermore, when we changed the definition of higher 
exposure intensity, the effect estimate of higher exposure 
intensity to BOB on cardiovascular and respiratory OPD 
visits was relatively robust (Table 4). The estimate of BOB 
occurrence, longer exposure duration, and higher exposure 
intensity on OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
p-value from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001. Moreover, the high­
est estimate of BOB occurrence on respiratory OPD vis­
its was observed at current day lag (lag 0), where ORs of 
respiratory OPD visits associated with BOB occurrence was 
1.0131 (95% CI: 1.0050, 1.0213). The significant difference 
on the effect estimates among provinces was also observed 
with I2 of 97.6% and p-value from Cochran’s Q test < 0.001. 
The province-specific ORs of OPD visits for cardiovascular 
and respiratory disease associated with BOB occurrence at 
different lag structures is shown in Table S7.

and intensity to BOB on OPD visits for cardiovascular and

intensity to BOB on OPD visits for cardiovascular and 
respiratory diseases in Thailand during the period spanning 
from January 2016 to December 2020. The results indicate 
that BOB occurrence day was associated with higher risk 
of cardiovascular and respiratory OPD visits compared to 
non-BOB occurrence day. The negative effect of exposure 
to BOB on cardiovascular OPD visits was found at lag 1 
(Fig. 2). This finding may be due in part to the harvesting 
effect, where the susceptible persons may visit the OPD 
due to cardiovascular disease at earlier time after expo­
sure, leading to a fewer number of OPD visits at later lag 
(Schwartz 2001; Zanobetti et al. 2002). Longer exposure 
duration to BOB was also associated with increased risk of 
cardiovascular and respiratory OPD visits. Higher exposure 
intensity was not significantly associated with OPD visits 
for both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The effect 
estimates were robust even when changing degrees of free­
dom of the natural cubic spline function for adjusting tem­
perature and relative humidity and varying the definition of 
higher exposure intensity, as well as after adjusting for other 
air pollutants.
The estimated risk of cardiovascular and respiratory OPD 
visits associated with BOB occurrence was 1.0105 (95% CI: 
0.9971, 1.0240) and 1.0131 (95% CI: 1.0050, 1.0213) times 
higher than non-BOB occurrence. This finding is similar to 
disease was robust even after adjusting for other air pollut­
ants (Table S11).

and respiratory OPD visits than shorter exposure duration, 
respectively. These findings have been supported by the 
concept of the continuous exposure to high concentrations 
of particulate matter reporting that higher exposure to wild­
fire-related particulate matter was associated with increased 
burden of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospi­
tal admission (Requia et al. 2021; Ye et al. 2021). Specifi­
cally, exposure to biomass smoke activates the production 
of many pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 
(IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-α), thereby causing intracellular damage through the 
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reduc­
tion of antioxidant mechanisms. This would induce chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease and increase burden of respi­
ratory morbidity (De Oliveira Alves et al. 2017; Dutta et 
al. 2013; Silva et al. 2015). Moreover, higher exposure to 
smoke particles can affect cardiovascular system through 
inhalation pathway, where inhaled particle may penetrate 
into the circulatory system via the air-blood barrier (Wu 
et al. 2018), leading to oxidative stress, activation of auto­
nomic reflex, and systemic inflammation (Chen et al. 2021). 
Avoiding longer exposure to BOB related air pollution that 
last for many days might be difficult because of daily activi­
ties, but finding of this study can be useful for establishing 
the warning system of BOB-related air pollution in Thailand 
taken into account exposure duration to prevent harmful 
health effect of BOB-related air pollution since there was no 
official BOB warning system in Thailand to date.
We observed the negative association between higher 
exposure intensity to BOB and OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory disease, although there was statistically 
insignificant. This might be due in part to the effectiveness 
of protective practices in which people may spend less time 
outdoor during high concentration of particulate matter 
emitted by biomass burning in order to avoid exposure (De 
Pretto et al. 2015). Moreover, people may wear face masks 
in outdoor activities or use air purifier indoor when severe 
haze concentration has been reported upon checking the rel­
evant air quality index (AQI) on daily basis (Majumder et 
al. 2019; Sereenonchai et al. 2020). However, this negative 
association may also be observed by chance.
Several limitations of this study are acknowledged. First, 
we applied fire hotspot data from the Suomi NPP VIIRS 
instrument as indicator for the occurrence of BOB-related 
air pollution, which might not accurately represent the emis­
sion of air pollution from BOB because satellite observation 
sometimes cannot detect fire emission even when substantial 
amount of grounded-levels particles was emitted by BOB 
(Johnston et al. 2018). In case of few points of fire hotspot 
included, it may not significantly increase the concentration 
of air pollutants on that particular day which means that the 
main contributor may be originated from other sources such 
the result observed in previous studies in the upper North­
ern of Thailand, indicating that every 10 µg/m3 increase of 
PM10 on biomass burning day was associated with increased 
risk of OPD visits for respiratory diseases (Mueller et al. 
2020; Uttajug et al. 2021). We also observed that the occur­
rence of BOB was significantly associated with respiratory 
OPD visits, but was not significantly associated with car­
diovascular OPD visits, which is in agreement with previ­
ous studies (Johnston et al. 2014; Karanasiou et al. 2021; 
Martin et al. 2013). This finding might be speculated that 
there is no truly association between BOB occurrence and 
cardiovascular OPD visits or it could reflect the heteroge­
neity of the effect estimates among provinces. Neverthe­
less, the plausible mechanism underlying the effect of BOB 
occurrence on cardiovascular diseases has been suggested. 
In particular, exposure to smoke particles is likely to influ­
ence systemic inflammation, blood coagulation, and lipid 
peroxidation that are the cardiovascular risk factors (Bar­
regard et al. 2006; Chen et al. 2021). Moreover, higher risk 
of hospital admission for cardiovascular disease has been 
associated with wildfire events where BOB-related PM2.5 
is largely generated (Requia et al. 2021). Finding of this 
study also reveals that BOB occurrence was associated 
with a sudden increase in OPD visits for respiratory disease 
and with a lagged increase in OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar disease. Support of this result comes from a prior study 
suggesting that people with chronic respiratory conditions 
is susceptible to the exacerbation by exposure to air pollu­
tion, leading to an increase of respiratory morbidity (Jiang 
et al. 2016). However, the onset of cardiovascular disease 
requires lagged time after exposure (Peters et al. 2001). In 
order to reduce the effect of BOB related air pollution, spe­
cific actions are therefore required to reduce exposure or to 
reduce the emission of air pollution from BOB.
We observed the significantly high heterogeneity among 
the province-specific estimates, showing that the associa­
tion between BOB related air pollutant and OPD visits for 
cardiovascular and respiratory diseases highly varies among 
provinces. There is no clear evidence explaining the hetero­
geneity of the association between BOB related air pollutant 
and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases that is similarly 
observed in this study, but this high heterogeneity might be 
partly explained by the variation in geographical locations, 
as well as demographical and socioeconomic characteristics 
(Jones et al. 2020; Karanasiou et al. 2021) that require fur­
ther investigations.
Longer exposure duration to BOB was significantly asso­
ciated with increased risk of OPD visits for cardiovascu­
lar and respiratory diseases. Specifically, exposure to BOB 
occurrence for two or more consecutive day was associated 
with 1.0272 (95% CI: 1.0104, 1.0442) and 1.0275 (95% 
CI: 1.0139, 1.0413) times higher risk of cardiovascular

inherently controls for day of the week, long-term trend and 
seasonality, and personal characteristics because each case 
was served as their own controls. Moreover, we compre­
hensively controlled for air pollution and meteorological 
variables that may influence the occurrence of BOB-related 
air pollution and number of OPD visits for cardiovascular 
and respiratory disease. Therefore, results of this study are 
reliable, to some extent.
5  Conclusions
Exposure to BOB occurrence was associated with an imme­
diate effect on respiratory OPD visits and a lagged effect 
on cardiovascular OPD visits. We also observed that longer 
exposure duration to BOB was significantly associated with 
higher risk of OPD visits for cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases. However, we found that higher exposure intensity 
to BOB-related air pollution was associated with lower risk 
of OPD visits, although it is not statistically significant. 
Finding from this study can be used to improve or establish 
the warning systems to reduce cardiovascular and respira­
tory risk associated with exposure to BOB-related air pollu­
tion and longer exposure duration. Further study may also 
require quantifying the compositions of BOB-related air 
pollution so as to gain insight into understanding the toxico­
logical effects of BOB occurrence in Thailand.

as vehicle exhaust, particularly in the urban areas. This can 
lead to exposure misclassification. In addition, air pollution 
from BOB might be affected by burning events from sur­
rounding countries (transboundary haze), in which air pol­
lution from BOB might not be captured as no occurrence 
of fire hotspot in this study area was detected. However, 
we observed that concentration of PM10, one of the major 
air pollutants emitted from BOB (Chen et al. 2017; Junpen 
et al. 2018), in the day with BOB occurrence was signifi­
cantly higher than that in the day with non-BOB occurrence 
(p-value < 0.001) (Fig. S2). Hence, using fire hotspot data 
as a proxy for BOB occurrence in this study is reasonable, 
to some extent. Second, fire hotspot data was obtained from 
the satellite database, as well as air pollution and meteoro­
logical data was obtained from the air quality monitoring 
stations that is not well representing personal exposure. This 
could result in non-differential misclassification that biases 
the effect estimate towards the null hypothesis (Copeland et 
al. 1977). Therefore, findings from this study are unlikely 
due to false positive. Third, we did not quantify the concen­
tration of air pollution that is specifically emitted by BOB. 
Nevertheless, we characterized higher intensity of BOB 
according to fire hotspot occurrence and PM10 concentra­
tion that is well correlated (Fig. S2), indicating that higher 
PM10 concentration may be contributed from BOB occur­
rence. Moreover, we explored the effects of longer expo­
sure duration to BOB related air pollutant on OPD visits by 
defining two or more consecutive days of active fire hotspot 
occurrence as indicator for longer exposure duration. This 
result is only reflected that the effects of two or more con­
secutive days of exposure have the same effect on OPD vis­
its. Fourth, we did not take into account the effect of BOB 
occurrence on OPD visits in different population groups, 
such as age, sex, or other socioeconomic characteristics. 
Therefore, findings of this study could not determine which 
groups of population are more susceptible to the effects of 
BOB that may need to consider in the future study.
Several strengths of this study are also noted. First, it 
is the first multi-provinces study across Thailand deter­
mined the effect of BOB occurrence and health outcomes 
taken into account longer exposure duration and higher 
exposure intensity. Therefore, findings of this study could 
provide an insight into understanding the possible health 
effects of BOB occurrence over the whole Thailand. Sec­
ond, we estimated the association between BOB occurrence 
and OPD visits using both PM10 concentration data from 
air quality monitoring stations and fire hotspot data from 
satellite observations that might be more accurate reflecting 
exposure to BOB-related air pollution compared to previ­
ous studies that used only PM10 concentration to categorize 
burning event (Martin et al. 2013; Mueller et al. 2020; Sah­
ani et al. 2014). Third, the study design used in this study

Abstract
India, a highly populated economy in transition generates huge quantity of municipal solid wastes and its management is 
posing great challenges. Infrastructural limitations force the urban local bodies to rely on traditional routes such as open 
dumpyards and landfills, where incidents of massive fire breakouts are often reported. In places where the collection system 
fails, the public seeks a much easier option of open burning of wastes in streets and households. The study reports a com-
parative assessment of 17 PCDD/Fs and 12 dl-PCBs emitted to air and residue during the repetitive incidents of massive fire 
breakouts at a municipal solid waste dumpyard and localized street waste burning in cities of India. The study also evaluated 
the direct exposure routes viz. inhalation as well as dermal and predicts the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks 
to the receiving population. The observed PCDD/F levels in the ambient air and burned residue samples ranged from 2.7 to 
41.4 pgTEQ/m3 and 79.8 to 860 ngTEQ/kg, while that of dl-PCB varied from 0.2 to 2.3 pgTEQ/m3 and 6.0 to 46.2 ngTEQ/
kg respectively. The dermal, as well as the inhalation daily exposure doses were estimated and the non-carcinogenic hazard 
indices of the children were found to be in levels of concern at two of the street burning sites while for adults the levels were 
found to be within the threshold limit. The cumulative Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) values ranged from 2 × ­10–6 
to 2 × ­10–4 suggesting moderate to low risk to cancer or cancer-linked illnesses to exposed individuals.

Introduction
The domestic and commercial non-hazardous garbage gen-
erated from the community life activities poses great chal-
lenges in its management due to the variable compositions, 
high moisture content, fast putrescible nature and huge 
volume of generation (Nandy et al. 2015). Several factors 
such as outdated waste collection mechanisms, unskilled 
manpower, inadequate infrastructure, lack of scientific and 
professional approach in selecting suitable treatment pro-
cesses and implementation of regulations are some of the 
major challenges for developing nations in the manage-
ment of municipal solid wastes (MSW) (Ramaswami et al. 
2016). India also faces significant difficulties in MSW 
management and out of the total generated solid waste 
quantity, only 20–30% gets treated while the remaining 
70–80% ends up in smaller residential/street open dumps 
or larger MSW dumpyards (Sharma and Jain 2019). The 
indiscriminate dumping of wastes over the past few dec-
ades has led to the formation of several legacy dumpyards 
in India and the majority of them are devoid of any sci-
entific or engineering measures to monitor or manage the 
formation of landfill gases (LFGs) (Waste Atlas, Sharma 
et al. 2019). Incidents of fires are very frequent in these 
landfill/dumpyard sites such as Ghazipur (Delhi), Deonar 
(Mumbai), Dhapa (Kolkata), Brahmapuram (Kochi) etc., 
which are triggered by combustible gases generated from 
heaps of putrescible wastes and burns out several hundred 
tons of waste every year (Annepu 2012; Project report 
on Indo-German initiatives: A case of waste management 
2016).
Moreover, the non-hazardous nature of the MSW allows 
people to experiment and practice various options such as 
littering in streets, disposing of in running waters, open 
burning etc. and is observed commonly across India. The 
general public considers the open burning of MSW as a 
cheap and easy way to reduce waste volume and also to 
get rid of the associated smell, infectious vector breeding 
conditions, scavenging animals etc. (Kumar et al. 2015; 
Vreeland et al. 2016). Several studies reported that the 
uncontrolled combustion of MSW could lead to the emis-
sion of highly toxic fumes and respirable particulates into 
the breathing zones of the atmosphere. In addition, the 
dispersion of burned residue can contaminate the soil, 
surface and groundwater and sediments, all of which may 
finally reach the human food chain (Lemieux 2002). It was 
identified that open burning of MSW is a major source 
of unintentional persistent organic pollutants (U-POPs) 
such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), 
polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and polychlo-
rinated biphenyls (PCBs) (commonly called dioxin-like 
POPs or dl-POPs) and hence has been notified as a source 
category in the ‘standardized toolkit for identification and 
quantification of dioxin and furan releases’ laid down by 
UNEP (Fiedler 2007). Considering its persistent, bio-
accumulative and toxic properties, the dl-POPs have been 
classified as class-A carcinogens by International Agency 
for Research in Cancer (IARC) (McGregor et al. 1998). 
Hitherto, several studies reported high levels of dioxins 
and PCBs (4–4000 times) than that of control sites in the 
ambient air followed by biomass combustion, landfill or 
dumpyard fire breakouts (Shih et al. 2008; Fajkovic et al. 
2018; Mazzucco et al. 2020; Weichenthal et al. 2015).
It can be noticed that massive fire breakout incidents 
in legacy dumpyards/landfill sites receive quick public 
attention as the spontaneous emission of thick smoke and 
possible allergies and breathing difficulties to people in 
the locality force the authorities to take necessary steps to 
extinguish the fire and to monitor the situation. Whereas 
the small-scale littering and burning of wastes in open 
places, roadsides, backyards etc. are often ignored by 
citizens as well as authorities since the discomfort caused 
by smoke/particulate emissions are relatively negligible 
owing to the lower volume of waste burned at any par-
ticular instance. Although the unit quantity of waste dis-
posed of is less, such incidents occur routinely in several 
parts of a city and hence the annual cumulative emission 
will be much higher but are mostly ignored (Wiedinmyer 
et al. 2014; Cogut 2016). Often such waste heaps in streets 
will remain smoldering throughout the day, which are the 
most favourable conditions for the formation of products 
of incomplete combustions. Another danger associated 
with the episodes of street open burning is its close vicin-
ity to residential, educational and commercial activities, 
where the probability of human exposure is high compared 
with relatively suburban located legacy dumpyard/land-
fill sites. Several studies reported the interdependence of 
adverse health effects and proximity of community life 
settlement to the dumpyard/landfill site, but investigations 
on the risks posed by street open burnings are very limited 
(Porta et al. 2009).
The present study has undertaken onsite ambient air and 
residual ash sampling followed by estimation and congener 
fingerprinting of the dl-POPs emitted during the massive 
fire breakout incidents at Brahmapuram MSW dumpyard 
and open burning of wastes in streets in urban city centres 
of Kerala, India. A detailed investigation to understand the 
daily exposure doses arising from the inhalation and dermal 
routes were carried out for two age groups (children and 
adults) and both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks 
associated with the exposures were estimated. A quantitative 
assessment of the human health risk posed by the dl-POPs 
emission from the routine small-scale street burning prac-
tices and its comparison with that of massive dumpyard fires 
is the first such study reported to the best of our knowledge.

Methods
Sampling Sites
Street Waste Burning Sites
Three major roadside dumping sites in Thiruvanan-
thapuram, Kerala—Pettah (8° 29′ 44″ N, 76° 55′ 49″ 
E), Thakarapparambu (8° 29′ 11″ N, 76° 56′ 45″ E) and 
Attakulangara (8° 28′ 46″ N, 76° 57′ 4″ E) were selected 
for the study (Fig. 1). The sites are situated in the Thiru-
vananthapuram corporation region (capital of the state 
of Kerala) where regular intentional/un-intentional waste 
open burning events are reported. The ambient air high 
volume PUF samplers were operated at approximately 
2–5 m distant from the waste pile and are closer to the 
routine movement of the general public. The ambient 
air sampling at Pettah and Attakulangara was operated 
continuously for 22 and 25 h respectively in one stretch 
whereas at Thakarapparambu smoke ceased two times 
and correspondingly sampler was also switched off and 
restarted upon re-ignition and visible smoke generation to 
avoid dilution while ensuring collection of approximately 
300 ­m3 of the air sample.
Accidental Fire Breakout Site at Brahmapuram MSW 
Dumpyard, Kerala
The Brahmapuram MSW treatment centre and dumping site 
(9° 59′ 28″ N, 76° 21′ 59″ E) is situated very close to the 
Smart city project, Kochi, the commercial capital of the state 
of Kerala and is approximately 7 km away from the city 
centre (Fig. 1). The plant receives approximately 350–400 
tons of MSW per day. Presently the material recovery and 
composting units are non-functional/partially operated and 
hence a major share of waste received goes to open dumping 
and approximately 6 lakh tons of legacy wastes are dumped 
over 60 acres of land (Kochi Waste to Energy Project 2018). 
The dl-POPs emission during two major fire breakout inci-
dents reported at the site: one in 2019 (22rd–25th February 
2019) and the second in 2020 (18th–20th February 2020) 
were investigated in the present study. The air samples were 
collected at about 150–170 m away from the epicenter of the 
fire where the settlements of plant workers were located. The 
farther distance from the epicenter was chosen for operating 
the samplers to ensure the safety of the supporting staff and 
samplers from any possible escalation of fire. As the power 
supply to the area was disconnected due to fire hazards, a 
diesel-powered generator (Hitachi Corporation, Japan) was 
utilized for the uninterrupted operation of PUF samplers.
Sampling Procedure
The high-volume ambient air sampler (APM 460, Envirotech 
Instruments Pvt. Ltd, India) was used for the ambient air 
sampling consisted of a stainless-steel filter paper holder 
which can accommodate 25 × 20 cm filter paper, 15 cm long 
cylindrical glass-lined cartridge to hold polyurethane foam 
(PUF) media and a timer to set the sampling time. The glass 
made PUF cartridge was pre-cleaned by rinsing with acetone 
and the PUF plugs were Soxhlet extracted for 16 h with 
toluene and dried under high purity nitrogen gas to elimi-
nate possibilities of cross-contamination before every sam-
pling. Pre-weighed Whatman quartz micro-fibre filter (QFF) 
papers were used for the particulate phase collection and the 
PUF plugs were spiked with 100 pg of sampling standards 
(13C-labelled congeners of 1234 TCDF, 1234 TCDD, PCB 
79, PCB 60, PCB 127, PCB 159) to evaluate the sampling 
efficiency.
Two air samples each from two fire breakout incidents at 
Brahmapuram reported in 2019 & 2020 respectively and one 
sample each from street waste burnings at Pettah, Thakarap-
parambu and Attakulangara were collected for the present 
study. The air sampling was carried out in such a way that as 
far as possible a minimum of 300 ­m3 of air at a sampling rate 
of 200 LPM was collected (USEPA method TO-9A 1999). 
It was not attained during the dumpyard fire incident at 
Brahmapuram due to delays in reporting of the incident and 
logistics from CSIR-NIIST located (350 km away) from the 
site of occurrence. At Brahmapuram dumpyard site, burned 
residue samples were collected from 4–5 points each from 
two of the fire ridden MSW heaps and were made into 2 Nos 
of composite samples representing each heap through con-
ing and quartering method. One composite burned residue 
sample from each of the street waste burning sites at Pettah, 
Thakarapparambu and Attakulangara were also collected.
Sample Analysis
All the samples were extracted within 30 days from the date 
of sampling and analyzed within 45 days from the date of 
extraction. The QFF and PUF plugs were retrieved from 
the sampler and the final weight of the QFF was noted for 
calculating PM concentration. The mass-labelled (13C) con-
geners of PCDD/Fs—17 nos (100 pg each) and MO&NO-
PCBs—12 nos (500 pg each) were spiked onto the PUF 
plugs before extraction as internal standards (ISTD) to 
assess analytical recovery. The glass cartridge was rinsed 
with acetone followed by toluene for the complete transfer 
of residues. The rinsates were concentrated using a rotary 
evaporator (R-300, Buchi Corporation, Switzerland) and fur-
ther added into the Soxhlet extractor solvent flask. The QFF 
and PUF were extracted together in a Soxhlet system with 
toluene as charging solvent for 16 h at 5 siphons per hour.

The burned residue samples were dried in a hot air oven at 
103 °C for 3 h to remove moisture content, weighed 5 g of 
dried sample, mixed with an equal amount of sodium sulfate 
to remove any residual moisture and were spiked with ­C13 
labelled internal standards before Soxhlet extraction. The 
sample extracts were then concentrated using a rotary evapo-
rator and were cleaned up and fractionated using three col-
umn based (Multilayer silica column, Alumina column and

carbon column) automated system (DEXTech Pure, LCTech, 
Germany). The first fraction was obtained as 1:1 DCM: Hex-
ane solution containing MO & NDL PCBs and the second 
fraction as toluene containing PCDD/F and NO-PCBs. A 
nitrogen evaporator (Supervap-6, FMS Inc, USA) was used 
for concentrating the sample fractions to dryness. Both the 
sample fractions were then spiked with 20 pg syringe stand-
ards (1278 TCDF, 123468 HxCDF, 1234689 HpCDF) and 
100 pg (PCB 70, 111, 170) respectively, and finally recon-
stituted in 200 µL n-nonane.
GC-triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Model: 
7890B/7000C, Agilent Technologies, Germany) was used 
for the quantitative analysis. The MS/MS was operated in 
electron ionization mode (EI) at 70 eV coupled with the 
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method for quantifica-
tion. The GC injection was made through solvent vent mode 
at 120 °C and the injection volume was 4 µL. 60 m DB-5MS 
UI (Agilent technologies, Germany) GC column was used 
(0.25 um film thickness, 0.25 mm internal diameter) for the 
analysis. The GC oven temperature program for the PCDD/F 
analysis was from 60 to 325 through three ramps with rates 
30 °C/min, 2 °C/min and 10 °C/min. The final hold time 
was 5 min and the total run time was 35.5 min. The carrier 
gas (helium) flow rate was static 1 mL/min and MS source 
temperature was 330 °C.
Analytical Quality Control
Isotopic dilution mass spectrometric method was employed 
for the confirmatory analysis of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs 
(dl-POPs) and hence the obtained individual native con-
gener concentrations were corrected with internal standard 
recoveries of the corresponding 13C labelled congeners. The 
WHO-2005 TEF factors of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were 
used for calculating the final TEQ (Van Den Berg et al. 
2006). The ISTD recoveries for the corresponding congeners 
should be in the range of 60–120%. The deviations if any, 
was acceptable only when the contribution of the congener 
to total TEQ is less than 10%.
The limit of quantification (LOQ) for all the congeners 
under the study was calculated from the lowest acceptable 
calibration point complying with the validation criteria 
specified for GC–MS/MS as per EU regulations 644/2017 
such as (i) the relative response factor (RRF) ≤ 30% (ii) rela-
tive standard deviation (RSD) ≤ 15% (iii) relative ion ratio 
tolerance ˂ 15% (EU (No.) 644/2017). The on-column con-
centration corresponding to the particular calibration point 
was considered as the LOQ (Law et al. 2018, L’Homme 
et al. 2015). For the congeners found below the limit of 
quantification (LOQ), the upper bound levels were taken 
as LOQ during the calculation of the final TEQ as specified 
in standard reporting protocols of dl-POPs. As the study 
was targeted to assess the human exposures to PCDD/F and 
dl-PCB emissions, upper bound levels obtained from the 
analysis were considered for all exposure dose calculations. 
To understand the background levels from any other sources 
such as vehicular exhausts in pristine and urban locations, 
a control and field blank site sampling were also carried 
out in the study. CSIR-NIIST institute campus was taken as 
the control site where no open littering and burning activity 
is practiced and field blank sample was collected from the 
Thakarapparambu site on a day when open burning activity 
was not occurring. The control and a field blank ambient air 
levels were used as reference values for comparison with 
open burning site emission data.
Statistical Analysis
The ratios between cumulative congener concentrations of 
PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs were analyzed for each sam-
ple. The concentration ratios can be used to understand the 
predominant formation mechanism underwent during open 
burning. Further congener specific contributions to total 
TEQ in samples were calculated and plotted using Micro-
soft Excel 2019. A correlation matrix was also generated 
to understand the interdependence between the detection 
frequencies of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs congeners in burned 
residue and air samples. Further, a ground-truthing attempt 
was also been conducted by estimating the correlations of 
congener fingerprint obtained from the present study with 
respect to the simulated open burning studies reported previ-
ously in the region.
Exposure Assessment and Risk Prediction
The emission levels observed in ambient air and residual 
ash samples were utilized for assessing the risk associated 
(non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic) with two direct routes 
of human exposure—inhalation and dermal pathways. The 
daily intake doses of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs through these 
two routes were calculated for two age categories—children 
(1–17 years of age) and adults (18–70 years of age). The 
Daily Exposure Dose through inhalation and dermal (DED-
inh and DEDder—mg ­kg−1 ­day−1) were calculated as per the 
Eqs. 1 and 2, following ATSDR Public health Assessment 
Guidance Manual (ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guid-
ance Manual 2005).

CF—conversion factor ­(10–6), BW—average body weight

considered for the calculation of daily exposure dose (DED), 
hazard quotients and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) 
values. The average body weight and lifetime assigned to the 
Indian population was taken for calculations, whereas total 
soil adhered was considered as per the ATSDR document as 
no nation-specific data was available.
Hazard Quotient (HQ), the ratio of daily exposure dose to 
reference dose is used for the non-carcinogenic risk assess-
ment and is calculated as per Eqs. 3 and 4. The threshold value 
of HQ is 1, where HQ < 1 indicates lower exposure than no 
observed effect dose and is considered safe. For dioxin-like 
POPs, no reference doses are available to date in India and 
hence tolerable daily intake levels recommended by WHO for 
the ingestion route (TDI—1–4 pgTEQ/kg of body weight per 
day) was adopted (WHO 1998). HI—Hazard Index represents 
the cumulative effect of the HQs arising from various chemi-
cals through different exposure pathways and in the present 
case it was calculated by summing the HQs emanating from 
dermal and inhalation route of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs (Eq. 5).

The cancer risk for the whole life exposure was deter-
mined through Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) for 
both dermal and inhalation pathways as per the methodol-
ogy specified by USEPA. An upper bound estimate of the 
response per unit chemical intake defined as the cancer slope 
factor (SF) was used for calculating ILCR (Eq. 6) through 
the dermal route. In the case of inhalation risk, IUR—inha-
lation unit risk factor was used to assess the cancer potency 
factor using the Eq. 7. ILCR was determined for both PCDD/
Fs and dl-PCBs and cumulative risk was calculated by the 
summation of dermal and inhalation risks posed by PCDD/
Fs and dl-PCBs, respectively (Eq. 8).
The carcinogenic benchmark described by USEPA was 
used for comparing the derived incremental lifetime cancer 
risk (ILCR) values. The ILCR values are classified as val-
ues ≤ 1 × ­10−6 correspond to very low, 1 × ­10−6 to 1 × ­10−4 
are low; 1 × ­10−4 to 1 × ­10−3 are moderate; 1 × ­10−3 to 
1 × ­10−1 are high and values > 1 × ­10−1 represent very high 
risk (ATSDR Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual 
2005).
Results and Discussion
Dioxin Levels Observed During Street Waste Burning
Table 2 shows the PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs levels in the ambi-
ent air and burned residue samples collected from street 
waste burning sites. The ambient air volume collected was 
in the range of 302–360 ­m3 with sampling durations varying 
from 24 to 30 h. The observed levels of particulate mat-
ter ranged from 316 to 1311 µg/m3 at these sites. Levels 
of PCDD/Fs observed in air and burned residue samples 
were found to be in the range of 13.0–41.4 pg TEQ/m3 and 
369–860 ng TEQ/kg, while that of dl-PCBs varied from 0.2 
to 2.3 pg TEQ/m3 and 11.9 to 46.2 ng TEQ/kg, respectively.

were found to be 65–200 times higher than the control site 
and 10–32 times higher than the field blank values (Table 2). 
All the 17 PCDD/F congeners and 12 dl-PCB congeners 
were detected above the LOQs. The findings indicate that 
such kind of low intensity, high-frequency open burning 
incidents may contribute significantly to the total annual 
dioxin emission.
The congener wise contribution of PCDD/Fs and dl-
PCBs towards total toxicity equivalence (TEQ) are shown 
in Fig. 2a and b and the congener profiles observed in the 
samples with standard error bars are shown in Figs. S1–S4. 
The predominant PCDD/F congeners found in the air and 
burned residue samples of Pettah and Thakarapparambu 
sites were 1234678-HpCDD and OCDD whereas in Attaku-
langara the pattern observed in the air indicates a higher 
proportion of 2378-TCDF and 12378-PeCDF and in resi-
due samples, 1234678-HpCDF and OCDD were the major 
congeners. PCB-114 and PCB-118 were the major dl-PCB 
congeners in the air samples from Thakarapparambu and 
Attakulangara whereas PCB-114 and PCB-123 were the 
dominant congeners in ambient air sampled at Pettah site. 
In the case of burned residue samples also Thakarapparambu 
and Attakulangara showed similarity as PCB-77 and PCB-
81 being the most predominant congeners and in samples 
from Pettah PCB-77 and PCB-105 were the prominent ones. 
The congener profiles observed in ambient air as well as in 
burned residue do not exhibit a uniform abundance pattern 
even at same sites. An important shortcoming associated 
with the onsite studies of dioxins emissions is the uncer-
tainty associated with the waste composition, burned mass,

combustion temperature and dilution factors (Lemieux et al. 
2000). Dl-POPs emission from uncontrolled open combus-
tion is highly dependent on these factors where even the 
emission factors generated from lab scale simulated studies 
varied over 3–4 orders of magnitude (Hedman et al. 2005; 
Wevers et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2011, Ajay et al. 2021). This 
indicates that the variations in concentrations or congener 
profiles of dl-POPs with respect to different open burning 
sites monitored in the present study could be presumably due 
to variations in combustion conditions and waste composi-
tions (Gullett et al. 2010).
Dioxins Levels Observed During Fire Breakout 
Incidents at Brahmapuram
Table 3 shows levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs observed in 
ambient air and burned residue samples collected during the 
fire breakout incidents at Brahmapuram waste dumpyard site 
in consecutive years 2019 and 2020, respectively. The aver-
age levels of PCDD/Fs observed in the air and burned resi-
due matrices during the 2019 incident were 10.3 pgTEQ/m3 
and 158.2 ngTEQ/kg whereas that of dl-PCB were found to 
be 0.3 pgTEQ/m3 and 11.7 ngTEQ/kg, respectively. And in 
the 2020 incident, the average levels of PCDD/Fs observed 
in air and burned residue matrices were 3.2 pgTEQ/m3 and 
82.1 ngTEQ/kg respectively. In the case of dl-PCBs 0.3 
pgTEQ/m3 and 7.1 ngTEQ/kg were the average concentra-
tions observed in the air and burned residue matrices. In 
2019, the fire breakout incident lasted for 4 days and 24 h of 
active fumes were sampled whereas, during the fire break-
out incident in 2020, the fire was brought under control on 
the 3rd day through watering of the waste piles and hence 
active smoke was absent for the majority of sampling dura-
tion. This could be the reason for lowered levels of PCDD/
Fs and dl-PCBs in samples from the 2020 incident. The 
observed levels at dumpyard fire breakout sites were 10–20 
folds lower than the street waste burning sites (Tables 2, 
3) and this could be due to the fact that the PUF samplers 
were placed 150–170 m away from the epicenter of fire in 
the former case when compared to 2–5 m at the latter site. 
The observed levels of PCDD/Fs in ambient air during 2019 
and 2020 incidents were 50 and 15 times higher than the 
control site levels and 8 and 2.5 times higher than the field 
blank levels.
The congener wise contribution to total PCDD/F and 
dl-PCB TEQ are shown in Fig. 3a and b and the conge-
ner profiles observed at the site with standard error bars 
are shown in Figs. S1–S4. 1,234,678-HpCDD and OCDD 
were the most prominent PCDD/F congeners in the air sam-
ples of 2019 and 2020 incidents and also in burned residue 
samples from 2019. The burned residue sample from 2020 
showed higher levels of 1,234,678-HpCDD and 1,234,678-
HpCDF. The major dl-PCB congeners in the air samples 
from 2019 and 2020 were PCB-118, PCB-114 and PCB-123 
respectively. In the case of burned residue samples PCB-
123, PCB-118, PCB-77 and PCB-123 were respectively the 
major congeners in 2019 and 2020.
Statistical Analysis and Correlation Studies
The trend of group-wise congener abundance observed in air 
samples was dl-PCBs > PCDFs > PCDDs, and in burned res-
idue samples was dl-PCBs > PCDDs > PCDFs which were 
in agreement with the findings of simulated MSW combus-
tion studies reported on Indian conditions (Ajay et al. 2021). 
Among PCDD/Fs the predominance of PCDDs over PCDFs 
was generally observed indicating the higher availability of 
oxygen due to open combustion conditions (Addink and Olie 
1995). In addition, an abundance of PCDDs and higher chlo-
rinated congeners in the majority of samples indicates that 
heterogeneous condensation of precursor molecules involv-
ing both gas and solid phase reactants was prevailing during 
open burning (Huang and Buekens 1995; Wikström et al. 
2003).

date the interrelationship between dioxins, dl-PCBs and PM

concentration exhibited a very high correlation with PCDD/
Fs air emission (ρ = 1), whereas poor correlations were 
observed with respect to dl-PCBs emissions (ρ = 0.14). This 
difference could be attributed to the antagonistic effect of 
two aspects i.e. high particulate bound nature of PCDD/F 
congeners and the relatively high volatility of dl-PCBs 
(Heo et al. 2014; Cindoruk and Tasdemir 2007). Further, 
the PCDD/Fs levels in air samples were highly correlated 
with burned residue levels, whereas a statistically signifi-
cant correlation of dl-PCBs in air and residue samples was 
hardly observed. Although PCDD/Fs levels in air samples 
was not correlated with dl-PCB levels, both the groups 
were highly correlated in residue samples similar to those 
reported elsewhere (Cortés et al. 2014; Ba et al. 2009). The 
higher affinity of PCDD/Fs towards burned residues during 
open burning conditions has been previously reported which 
could be due to the planar structure of these compounds as it 
promotes strong binding towards carbonaceous residual mat-
ter. Some reports also suggest the role of shrinkage of the 
burning surface during combustion which could restrict the 
dioxins formed at the surfaces from emitting to air (Hazard-
ous Chemicals from Open Burning of Waste in Developing 
Countries—Final Report 2010; Zhang et al. 2017). On the 
contrary, the commensurate rise of dl-PCBs levels in air 
and residue samples points to its lower particulate adsorp-
tion tendency which needs detailed investigation to eluci-
date the mechanism of congener distribution between phases 
depending on the degree of planarity of dl-PCBs (non-ortho 
& mono-ortho PCBs).
Further a comparative evaluation between the congener 
profiles observed in the present study with that of the general 
congener patterns reported from the open burning scenarios 
in the region was conducted to ensure that the emissions 
are exclusively from the MSW open burning incidents at 
the sites (Ajay et al. 2021). It could also lead to the deriva-
tion of dl-POPs congener fingerprint representative of MSW 
open burning sector in the region. The Spearman’s correla-
tion analysis to deduce the above hypothesis are shown in 
supplementary information, Tables S1–S4. It shows that the 
congener profiles of PCDD/Fs in burned residues samples 
from open burning sites reported in the present study showed 
a very high correlation with that observed in the simulated 
study. In the case of ambient air, the congener profile of 
all samples except the one from the Thakarapparambu site

exhibited a very high correlation with simulated combustion 
study profiles. An interesting finding is that even though the 
ambient air levels observed at different sites varied over two 
orders in magnitude, the congener profiles were having sta-
tistically significant correlations between them. Therefore, 
the congener profiles can be considered as a source finger-
print of open burning activities in the region. The dl-PCBs 
have not shown any notable correlations in the case of air 
samples, whereas a significant correlation was observed for 
residue samples in the present field samples vis-à-vis the 
reported congener profile of the simulated study.
Comparative Evaluation of Emission Levels 
with Previous Studies
There are no threshold levels established for dioxins in 
the ambient air or the burned residues from open burn-
ing in Indian conditions or internationally. Moreover, it is 
inappropriate to compare the permissible levels specified 
for stack emission vis-à-vis the non-point/area sources of 
emissions and hence an assessment of the extent of con-
tamination at the site cannot be derived from the observed 
air and residual level concentrations. From the literature 
survey, it was noted that only very few case studies based 
on real-time sampling during fire breakout incidents at 
waste dumpyards were reported previously and a compara-
tive evaluation of available studies is given in Table 5. 
A rapid decline in the levels of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs 
in ambient air with the increase in distance from the fire 
focal point was a notable observation, which was inferred 
in some of the previous studies as well (Ruokojärvi et al. 
1995; Mazzucco et al. 2020; Bergström and Björner 1992; 
Rada et al. 2018; Fajkovic et al. 2018; Weichenthal et al. 
2015; Nadal et al. 2016a, b). Ruokojärvi’s and Bergström’s 
groups conducted sampling at 2–10 m away from the 
fire focal point and the levels observed are comparable 
with the present study. The predicted concentrations of 
54.6–76.9 pgTEQ/m3 through modelling study by Rada 
et al. is very much similar to the current findings consid-
ering the possible dilution effects that may incur at the 
sites. On the contrary, Mazzucco et al. reported a high 
level of dioxin deposition in the soil at 1–3 km apart from 
the Bellolampo fire accident site in Italy whereas Nadal 
et al. reported much lower emission levels from tyre land-
fill fires in Spain at a similar distance. This indicates that 
the comparative evaluation needs to address different 
aspects such as waste quantity, type of waste, duration of 
the incident, micro-meteorological factors and the applied 
sampling and analytical methods to understand the trends 
of emission.

Assessment of Dioxin‑Like POP’s Emissions and Human Exposure Risk from Open Burning of Municipal…
1 3
Health Risk Assessment
The non-carcinogenic, as well as carcinogenic risks asso-
ciated with the dermal and inhalation exposures for the 
exposed community were estimated for all the sites. Approx-
imately 1–5 fire breakout incidents occur annually at Brah-
mapuram waste dumpyard site and considering the average 
atmospheric lifetime of dioxins as 26–130 h (approximately 
5–6 days), 30 days per year was considered as the exposure 
frequency (Atkinson 1991). The plant was commissioned 
in 2008 and the first fire breakout incident in the plant was 
reported in April 2010 and hence 10 years was considered 
as the exposure duration. In the case of open burning of 
street waste, the major centralized waste treatment facil-
ity in Thiruvananthapuram city was closed down in 2013. 
Since then, the frequency of road dumps and street waste 
burning incidents increased quite evidently and hence the 
subsequent 8 years was considered as the exposure duration. 
It was noted from surveillance studies that open burning of 
wastes is practiced at least once in every 2–3 days in the 
street sites of Thiruvananthapuram city. As per the ATSDR 
guidelines, the upper bound frequency of incidents needs 
to be considered for risk calculation. Thus 180 days per 
annum was taken as the exposure frequency for calculating 
the health risk assessment.
Daily Exposure Dose
Table 6 shows the estimated (daily exposure doses) DEDs 
through dermal and inhalation routes at the study sites. The 
PCDD/Fs dermal DEDs for children varied from 7.6 × ­10–12 
to 1.3 × ­10–10 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 and for adults, it var-
ied from 1.8 × ­10–12 to 3 × ­10–11 mgTEQ ­kg–1 bw ­day–1. The 
DEDs of PCDD/Fs from inhalation ranged from 4.8 × ­10–11 
to 4.5 × ­10–9 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 for children and 
1.1 × ­10–11 to 1.0 × ­10–9 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 for adults. 
In both routes, children were found to be more susceptible 
to the exposures of dioxins than adults. From Table 6 it can 
be noted that the cumulative exposure doses were up to 70 
times higher at street burning sites than the fire breakout 
incident site. A similar trend was found in the case of dl-
PCB daily exposure doses. The dermal doses of dl-PCBs 
varied from 6.6 × ­10–13 to 7.2 × ­10–12 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 
for children and 1.6 × ­10–13 to 1.7 × ­10–12 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw 
­day−1 for adults. Whereas the inhalation doses varied from 
4.6 × ­10–12 to 1.7 × ­10–10 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 for children 
and from 1.0 × ­10–12 to 3.8 × ­10–11 mgTEQ ­kg−1 bw ­day−1 
for adults. When compared between the exposure pathways, 
inhalation exposure doses were higher for both the age 
groups whereas comparison between the congener groups 
revealed that PCDD/Fs dose levels were approximately 30 
times higher than that of dl-PCBs (Table 6).
Non‑carcinogenic Risk: Hazard Quotient and Hazard 
Index
The non-carcinogenic risk estimates of PCDD/F/dl-PCBs from 
dermal and inhalation routes for children and adults are shown 
in Fig. 4a and b. The HQs for dermal risk was found to be 
very low in the range of 4 × ­10–3 to 1 × ­10–2 for children and 
5 × ­10–4 to 3 × ­10–3 for adults. Whereas the inhalation risk HQ 
was found to be 10–100 times higher than the dermal risk i.e. 
1.0–1.1 × ­10–2 for children and 3 × ­10–3 to 3 × ­10–1 for adults. 
Children were having higher HQ values in both the routes and 
can be considered as the higher risk community. In the case of 
dl-PCBs also a similar trend was observed where HQs calcu-
lated for inhalation route was higher than that of dermal by a 
factor of 10–100. Inhalation risk HQs for children and adults 
were in the range of 1 × ­10–3 to 4 × ­10–2 and 3 × ­10–4 to 1 × ­10–2 
respectively. Whereas dermal risk HQs ranged from 2 × ­10–4 
to 2 × ­10–3 for children and 4 × ­10–5 to 4 × ­10–4 for adults. A 
cumulative non-carcinogenic risk index (HI) from dermal and 
inhalation exposure to PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs was also calcu-
lated (Fig. 4a, b). Hazard quotients from dermal exposures at 
all the sites were having a very low contribution to HI rang-
ing from 2 to 13% for children and 2–14% for adults. Hazard 
indices at street burning sites were approximately up to 80 
times higher than that at dumpyard fire site and the highest 
HI for children (1.2) was at Thakarapparambu which crossed 
the threshold value of 1. At Attakulangara where the HI was

found to be 0.7 also point towards significant non-carcinogenic 
effects to children underexposure. The highest HI for adults 
(0.3) was at Thakarapparambu which was much lower than 
the reference limit value indicating very low non-carcinogenic 
risk. The probability of non-carcinogenic risk arising from 
PCDD/Fs exposure during open burning is much higher than 
the dl-PCBs, as 90–99% of the cumulative hazard indices were 
contributed by PCDD/Fs.
Carcinogenic Risk: Incremental Life Cancer Risk 
(ILCR)
Probabilistic cancer risk was estimated which is a depic-
tion of the number of people in a million equally exposed 
persons to develop cancer or cancer-linked illnesses 
over a lifetime (Fig. 5). The cancer risk from the der-
mal exposure of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs were found in 
the range of 3 × ­10–7 to 5 × ­10–6 whereas the inhalation 
exposure ranged from 2 × ­10–6 to 2 × ­10–4. Hence, dermal 
exposure is accountable for only low to very low cancer 
risks, while that associated with inhalation was found to 
be in the moderate to low range. The highest ILCR val-
ues through inhalation and dermal exposure were found 
at Thakarapparambu and Pettah respectively. The trends 
of carcinogenic risks arising from exposure to PCDDs 
were found to be 10–100 times higher than dl-PCBs. The 
ILCRs values of both PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs through der-
mal and inhalation pathways were summed together to

get the cumulative incremental lifetime cancer risk. The 
cumulative risk values ranged from 2 × ­10–6 to 2 × ­10–4 
which indicates moderate to low risk to exposed indi-
viduals. As per USEPA, ILCR values lower than 1 × ­10–6 
indicates the probability of no additional cancer risk to 
the exposed community whereas ILCRs in the range of 
1 × ­10–6 to 1 × ­10–4 indicate a moderate threat. The ILCR 
values higher than 1 × ­10–4 suggests ‘unacceptable’ expo-
sure conditions as per the ATSDR guidance manual and 
is likely to cause excess cancer risk to the community. 
At two of the street waste burning sites viz. Attakulan-
gara and Thakarapparambu the ILCRs were higher than 
1 × ­10–4 and in all the other sites values were in the range 
of 1 × ­10–6 to 1 × ­10–4. This indicates a moderate to unac-
ceptable level of cancer risk exists at all the sites and 
requires in-depth studies such as long-term sampling pro-
grams and bio-monitoring studies for the further evalua-
tion of the scenario.
Comparison of Carcinogenic Risk Assessment 
Studies
Assessment of cancer risk posed by dl-POPs from street 
waste burning based on real-time sampling studies was 
not available in the literature and hence, the findings of 
the present investigation were compared with a few studies 
which reported risk factors associated with MSW landfills 
(Table 7). The risk factors estimated in the present study 
was higher than most of the reported ones, as it reported 
the exposure risk based on the real-time sampling studies 
conducted during fire breakout incidents or street open burn-
ing activities whereas the former ones estimated risk in the 
vicinity of waste landfills from random sampling. A study 
conducted in Kenya on the risk assessment from open burn-
ing of MSW reported higher carcinogenic risk values and 
comparable non-carcinogenic risk with the present study 
(Shih et al. 2016). Another study on the risk factors asso-
ciated with PCDD/Fs emission in a 3 km buffer zone of a 
non-hazardous waste landfill area reported the possibility

of very low risk to the exposed community (Davoli et al. 
2010). Similarly, few other studies on the impact of hazard-
ous waste landfill sites to the nearby population reported 
lower ranges of risk factors (Palmiotto et al. 2014; Nadal 
et al. 2016a, b). ILCR reported at the street waste burning 
sites in the present study is the highest as per the compari-
son table (although the ingestion route is not included in 
the present study) and this is essentially due to the greater 
frequency of incidents and the possibility of lower radial 
dispersion of emitted dl-POPs.
Conclusions
The present study evaluated dl-POPs emissions from uncon-
trolled open burning of MSW and associated carcinogenic 
and non-carcinogenic risks through two pathways at selected 
streets and dumpyard sites in Kerala, India. The correla-
tion studies elucidated the possibility of deriving congener 
‘fingerprints’ for MSW open burning and points towards 
developing smart tools for source identification. The chil-
dren were found to be susceptible to the non-carcinogenic 
effects at one site whereas adults were found to be in safe 
limits with comparatively lower hazard indices. The cumu-
lative ILCR factors at the sites were in the range of 2 × ­10–6 
to 2 × ­10–4 which is classified as low to moderate risk as 
per ATSDR guidelines. The major pathway of exposure was 
through inhalation (more than 90%) and PCDD/Fs accounted 
for 90% of the cumulative risk. The street waste littering and 
burning were found to pose more threats to human health 
than dumpyard fires due to their episodic nature, higher 
exposure probability (closeness to settlements and public 
places) and ground-level emissions resulting in minimum 
dispersive dilutions.

Abstract
Background: Exposure to particulate matter (PM) emitted from biomass burning is an increasing concern,
particularly in Southeast Asia. It is not yet clear how the source of PM influences the risk of an adverse health
outcome. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare health risks of PM from biomass burning and
non-biomass burning sources in northern Thailand.
Methods: We collected ambient air pollutant data (PM with a diameter of < 10 μm [PM10], PM2.5, Carbon Monoxide
[CO], Ozone [O3], and Nitrogen Dioxide [NO2]) from ground-based monitors and daily outpatient hospital visits in
Thailand during 2014–2017. Outpatient data included chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), ischaemic heart
disease (IHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD). We performed an ecological time series analysis to evaluate the
association between daily air pollutants and outpatient visits. We used the 90th and 95th percentiles of PM10
concentrations to determine days of exposure to PM predominantly from biomass burning.
Results: There was significant intra annual variation in PM10 levels, with the highest concentrations occurring
during March, coinciding with peak biomass burning. Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) between daily PM10 and
outpatient visits were elevated most on the same day as exposure for CLRD = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.012 to 1.028) and
CBVD = 1.020 (95% CI: 1.004 to 1.035), with no association with IHD = 0.994 (95% CI: 0.974 to 1.014). Adjusting for
CO tended to increase effect estimates. We did not find evidence of an exposure response relationship with levels
of PM10 on days of biomass burning.
Conclusions: We found same-day exposures of PM10 to be associated with certain respiratory and cardiovascular
outpatient visits. We advise implementing measures to reduce population exposures to PM wherever possible, and
to improve understanding of health effects associated with burning specific types of biomass in areas where such
large-scale activities occur.

Introduction
Ambient air pollution, and most notably particulate mat-
ter (PM), causes significant harm on a global scale, in-
cluding over 4 million attributable deaths [1] and 5
million asthma emergency department visits [2] annu-
ally. Sources of PM can be both anthropogenic (e.g., traf-
fic, industry) and natural (e.g., dust, sea salt) [3]. One
significant contribution of PM emission is biomass burn-
ing of both natural and anthropogenic origin, including
wildfires, agricultural residue burning, land clearing, and
domestic fuel burning [4]. Historically, most research on
the health risks of PM has been documented in urban
areas where PM emissions are mainly derived from traf-
fic, domestic sources, and industry [5]. Regional, as well
as long-range, atmospheric transport also affects PM
concentrations in urban areas [6]. While a very active re-
search area, there is, at present, no scientific consensus
on differentiated health risks of PM from different
sources [7].
Most PM time series studies have focused on mortality
outcomes [8], and many have also demonstrated the
harmful effect of elevated ambient PM concentrations
on hospital admissions, particularly for cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases. A meta-analysis indicated about
a 1% increase in such admissions for each 10 μg/m3 rise
in ambient PM2.5 [9]. More recent studies have investi-
gated the effects of PM on health in other geographical
regions and from more diverse PM sources, including
biomass burning. A review of the health effects of wild-
fire smoke identified consistent evidence of respiratory
morbidity, though less clear effects on cardiovascular
health [10]. An examination of both epidemiological and
toxicological studies concluded that it was not yet clear
if urban (traffic) and biomass-derived PM entail differen-
tial health hazards [11].
Although satellite imagery indicates a global decline in
the number of active biomass fires, parts of Asia, due to
agricultural
intensification
and
crop
burning,
have
undergone increasing fire activity [12]. The population
of the upper north of Thailand is subject to annual
smoke haze events during the dry season, mainly January
to April and typically culminating in March, from bio-
mass burning activities in both Thailand and neighbour-
ing countries (e.g., Burma and Indonesia [13]). Biomass
burning in agricultural fields is practised to remove resi-
dues after the harvest and to manage weeds, while in
forests it can contribute to agricultural clearing and as-
sist with the collection of food products [14]. Klieng-
chuay et al. [15] identified that nearly 10% of daily PM10
concentrations in Mae Hong Son Province, Thailand
were in excess of the 120 μg/m3 daily PM10 standard set
by the Thailand Pollution Control Department (PCD);
such exposure has also been linked to additional pneu-
monia cases in the region [16]. The Government has
attempted to prevent haze by patrolling and extinguish-
ing fires during the critical period, with the involvement
of local communities, but this task faces myriad practical
obstacles [17].
We have undertaken a time-series analysis to investi-
gate the association of daily PM levels, from biomass
burning and other sources, with respiratory and cardio-
vascular hospital outpatient visits in northern Thailand.
We hypothesised that there would be no difference in
the health effects associated with PM between biomass
burning and other sources. This study is part of the lar-
ger research project to study the effects of air pollution
in Thailand: Thailand Air Pollution Health Impact As-
sessment (TAPHIA).
Methods
Study setting
Thailand, situated in Southeast Asia, has an overall
population of nearly 70 million [18] and is organised
into 77 provinces. Thailand’s economy has undergone a
transition
from
agricultural
to
manufacturing
and
services-based, with the total forest cover reduced from
over 50% of land area in the 1960s to about one third in
the 2000s; while now stabilised on a national level, de-
forestation has continued in northern Thailand [19].
The burning of crop residues in Thailand is estimated to
release 143,000 t of PM10 annually, as well as large
amounts of gases and organic compounds, most signifi-
cantly from rice straw burning [20]. For the present
study, we focussed on eight provinces with permanent
air quality monitors in the upper north region (i.e., the
study area; Fig. 1), including Chiang Mai, Lamphun,
Lampang, Phrae, Nan, Phayao, Chiang Rai, and Mae
Hong Son, with a combined population of 5.4 million.
Exposure data
The PCD manages 63 permanent ground stations to
monitor ambient levels of air pollutants across Thailand.
We collected hourly data from all monitors over the
period 1996 to 2017, including the pollutants PM10,
PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
ozone (O3), as well as temperature and relative humidity.
We identified all monitors located in the study area and
selected those with < 25% missing data during 2014–
2017 (i.e., the entire study period) to align with health
data (described in the following section). We primarily
examined the effects of PM, for which we focussed on
PM10, as sufficient PM2.5 data were available from only
two stations during the study period however, mean
daily PM10 and PM2.5 values were highly correlated
(Spearman’s rho = 0.88) at these sites. Each province in
the study area contained at least one background air
quality monitor to provide an indication of daily PM10
levels (n = 12, after exclusion of two ‘traffic’ orientated

air quality monitors). Mean daily data from each moni-
tor were deemed to be sufficient and included in the
analysis if ≥75% of measurements (i.e., 18 h) were avail-
able on a given day [21]. For O3, maximum daily values
of the 8-h rolling average were used, where at least six
hours of data were available [22]. Each province was
assigned the mean daily value from the monitors within
its boundary; the average value was used if more than
one monitor provided data on a given day in each
province.
Health data
Since 2002, the Thai government has funded universal
health coverage for its citizenry. This policy has under-
gone various changes since its inception, including the
expansion of access in 2012 to both public and private
hospitals for emergency medical services [23]. We ob-
tained individual records of all daily outpatient hospital
visits (i.e., emergency and scheduled) from the Thailand
Ministry of Public Health for the years 2010 to 2017. All
outpatient records were anonymised and included the
date, province, sex, age, and reason for visit based on the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); the re-
cords did not include the actual healthcare facility or na-
ture of visit (i.e., emergency or scheduled). We collected
outpatient data on chronic lower respiratory disease
(CLRD) visits (ICD-10: J40-J47), ischaemic heart disease
(IHD) (ICD-10: I20-I25), and cerebrovascular disease
(CBVD) (ICD-10: I60-I69). We excluded for analysis the
years 2010–2013, due to reporting limitations associated
with the aforementioned changes in universal health
coverage; therefore, the study period was 2014–2017.
Statistical analysis
We performed an ecological time series analysis to
examine the association between concentrations of am-
bient air pollutants and the above respiratory and car-
diovascular hospital visits on a daily basis. We employed
generalised linear models using a Poisson regression to
generate incidence rate ratios (IRR). To adjust for long-
term trends and seasonality, we included cubic splines
with seven knots per year, and accounted for increased
variance in the outcome data by scaling standard errors
using the square root of the Pearson Chi-squared-based
dispersion [24]. We also controlled for age group (re-
spiratory visits = 0–14, 15–64, 65+ years; cardiovascular
visits = 0–64, 65+ years), day of the week, sex, province,
and mean daily temperature and relative humidity.
Outpatient visits with missing or unreasonable ages (i.e.,
> 110 years old) or missing gender were omitted from

analysis (n = 720). We included zero admissions where
no daily outpatient records were indicated for a given
province, sex, and age group category. We ran models
separately for respiratory and cardiovascular (i.e., IHD,
CBVD,
and
IHD + CBVD)
visits
as
the
dependent
variable.
We examined the effect of mean concentrations of air
pollutants on the same day as visits, as well as through
the use of a lag for concentrations on the preceding 1–5
days, both individually and cumulatively. We included in
the model a binary indicator to identify when biomass
burning during January to April made an important con-
tribution to overall PM exposure, according to the 95th
percentile of PM10 over the entire study area during the
full study period (i.e., 1 January 2014 to 31 December
2017), which was 109.6 μg/m3. Previous research in the
study area indicated PM levels during March and April
were moderately to strongly correlated to ambient
markers of biomass burning [25] and the number of ac-
tive fires [26]. We specified an interaction term to exam-
ine any differentiation in hospital visits between PM10
exposure during burning and non-burning days [27]. Al-
though this method would elucidate any possible differ-
ential risks, it could not disentangle any attenuation
from PM source or concentration level (i.e. a flattening
of the exposure response curve at higher concentrations
[28]). We ran all models first with PM10, then, if Spear-
man correlations between PM10 and the gaseous pollut-
ants were < 0.7, adjusted for a second pollutant [22].
Model outputs represent IRRs per 10 μg/m3 increase in
PM10. In addition, we examined effects of PM10 separ-
ately by age (< 65/≥65 years) and sex, and performed a
sensitivity
analysis
to
reduce
the
biomass
burning
threshold to the 90th percentile (87.1 μg/m3). All statis-
tical analysis was completed using Stata (v15).
Results
The mean annual PM10 and gaseous pollutant con-
centrations in the study area were lowest in 2017
(Table 1). There was substantial within-year variation
in PM10 levels, with the highest concentrations con-
sistently experienced during March (Fig. 2), which
generally corresponded to the apparent number of
fires in the region (Fig. 3; see Fig. S1 for monthly
maps of the study region during 2014–2017). There
were n = 74 and n = 147 days across the study period
in excess of the 95th and 90th percentiles, respect-
ively, and all but one (in September) occurred during
February
to
April.
Spearman
correlations
between
PM10 and the gaseous pollutants were moderate to
strong: 0.57 (CO), 0.71 (NO2), and 0.82 (O3) (Table 2).
Daily PM10 values across the different sites on the
same date were strongly correlated (≥0.7). Since the
correlation of PM10 with O3 and NO2 were in excess
of 0.70, we did not adjust for these pollutants, but we
incorporated CO in separate two-pollutant models.
Overall, there were 53,694 CLRD, 7752 IHD, and 14,
228 CBVD visits over the 1461-day study period
(Table 3).
The association between daily PM10 and CLRD out-
patient visits on the same day (i.e., lag0) showed in-
creased IRRs per 10 μg/m3 (1.020 [95% CI: 1.012 to
1.028]) with a consistent upward trend (see Fig. S2);
however, on days with higher biomass burning-related
PM, there was no clear indication of a concentration
response association (1.002 [95% CI: 0.993 to 1.012]).
Including CO in the model enlarged the IRR for
PM10 (1.026 [95% CI: 1.017 to 1.035]) (Fig. 4). When
stratified by age and sex, risks were increased for
both sexes and both < 65 and ≥65 years of age for the
single pollutant PM10 models (see Table 4). The
strongest association of PM10 exposure with respira-
tory visits was on the same day, when compared to
concentrations on any of the previous five days; IRRs
were also elevated with lags 1–4. This trend was
consistent when adjusting for the presence of CO
(see Fig. 4).
There was no apparent association between same-
day PM10 and IHD visits on non-burning (0.994 [95%
CI: 0.974 to 1.014]) or burning days (0.991 [95% CI:
0.964 to 1.019]). By contrast, IRRs for CBVD visits
were significantly elevated with PM on non-burning
(1.020 [95% CI: 1.004 to 1.035]),but not burning days
(0.997 [95% CI: 0.976 to 1.019]); as with the trend for
CLRD visits, there was a consistent upward curve
with more uncertainty at higher concentrations (Fig.
S2). When adjusting for the presence of other pollut-
ants, similar trends were observed as those for CLRD
visits: IRRs were slightly increased with CO. When
stratified by age and sex, there were no clear in-
creased IHD risks with PM10 for both single and
multi-pollutant models; coefficients were highest for
those aged ≥65 years. Risks with CBVD were elevated
for males and for those < 65 years of age, but only
when adjusting for CO (Table 4). For CBVD visits,
the only significantly elevated risk was observed on
the same day of exposure and visit (i.e., lag0), with

risk estimates around or below the null for CBVD
with exposures on lags 0–5 (see Fig. 5); this pattern
held when adjusting for CO.
In the sensitivity analysis at lag0, using the 90th percentile
as the threshold for burning slightly reduced the PM10 risk
estimate with respiratory visits on non-burning days (1.017
[1.007 to 1.026]) and had little effect on that for burning
days (1.002 [0.994 to 1.009]). For the cardiovascular
outcomes, the lower burning threshold made little differ-
ence to the non-burning day IRR for PM10 and IHD visits
(0.996 [95% CI: 0.973 to 1.020]), but increased the IRR on
burning days to 1.015 (95%CI: 0.994 to 1.035). For CBVD
visits, the effect of PM10 on non-burning days was attenu-
ated to borderline significance (1.017 [95% CI: 0.999 to
1.035]), but there was little difference to the relationship on
burning days (0.998 [95% CI: 0.981 to 1.014]).

Discussion
Our study findings indicate increased outpatient hospital
visits for CLRD and CBVD, but not IHD, on the same
day as PM10 exposures in the upper north of Thailand.
These associations were maintained after adjusting for
ambient CO concentrations. Evidence of a greater risk
with PM10 was apparent for different sexes and health
outcomes: females (CLRD) and males (CBVD). Although
we identified overall risks of PM10 with CLRD and
CBVD visits when exposure was predominantly from
other (i.e., non-biomass burning) sources, we did not
identify
an
exposure-response
association
for
these
outcomes on days of higher concentrations with a
greater
proportion
of
PM
from
biomass
burning
exposure.
We identified more consistent risks for PM10 and
CLRD visits, which were elevated with both PM10
thresholds used to identify biomass burning days, com-
pared to CBVD visits. This result is in agreement with
findings from a recent global systematic review on air
pollution and cardiorespiratory diseases [29]. The re-
spiratory and cardiovascular systems appear to be most
sensitive to the harmful effects of PM [30], and several
mechanisms have been identified to explain links to
acute events. A host of physiological changes occur with
PM exposure that may contribute to exacerbation of
existing respiratory disease, including lung and systemic
inflammatory responses, and bronchoconstriction [31].
For cardiovascular outcomes, short-term exposure to
PM has been associated with such changes as reduced
heart rate variability, increased diastolic blood pressure,
and enhanced arterial vasoconstriction and blood coagu-
lation, all of which may contribute to acute events [32].

Larger risks on the same day of PM10 exposure com-
pared to lagged estimates have also been identified in
urban contexts, including all hospital admissions in 218
Chinese cities [33], COPD admissions in Beijing [22],
and also specifically with biomass burning: bushfire and
respiratory admissions in Australia [34, 35], and haze
and respiratory admissions in New Zealand (ages 15–64
years only [36]). Our results with CBVD visits, but not
IHD, conflict with findings from Morgan et al. [35],
where a relationship with cardiovascular admissions was
not identified using any lag. Nevertheless, other studies
of non-biomass
burning PM
have
found strongest
associations with cardiovascular admissions on the same
day as exposure [37–39] (females only). Our results
show a more prominent trend for effects only on the
same day for cardiovascular (CBVD only) health impacts
compared to respiratory outpatient visits, for which
there was an apparent increased risk also from prior
days’ exposure (until lag4). Mechanistically, for cardio-
vascular events, the heart and vascular system are sus-
ceptible to the negative effects of PM, especially in older
people and those with pre-existing heart disease, which
can trigger acute events, such as myocardial infarction
and stroke [40]. In contrast, although also exacerbated

by same day exposures, respiratory events might add-
itionally be precipitated by cumulative exposure over
several days before treatment is sought [37].
Our results showed elevated risks across age and sex
for CLRD, but not for CBVD visits. When stratifying by
sex, females exhibited a higher risk of respiratory visits
than males; nevertheless, risks were evident for both
sexes, which did not occur for either of the cardiovascu-
lar outcomes. Other studies have also found higher
coefficients for women and COPD in Beijing [22] and
Lanzhou, China [41]. The sex difference in PM10 re-
sponse may, in part, reflect the disparity in smoking
prevalence in Thailand among men (40%) and women
(2%) [42], which we did not control for in our analysis
(similar sex-specific smoking patterns occur in China
[43]). Thus, fluctuations in ambient PM may be less im-
portant with a larger proportion of smokers, who would
receive much higher doses from smoking than from out-
door air. While exposure to (traffic related) PM10 has
been found not to be related to the development of
asthma among smokers (but was in non-smokers) [44],
COPD/asthma admissions in London with PM10 expos-
ure were found elevated only in current smokers [45].
We found elevated risks for those < 65 years old for
CBVD visits when adjusting for CO. In general, research

has shown older populations to be more susceptible to
PM, though our finding for CBVD is not unique; for ex-
ample, Su et al. [39] found higher cardiovascular emer-
gency room visits with PM10 for those in Beijing aged
less than, and not over, 75 years. Ultimately, the < 65
years and ≥65 years risk estimates were similar in mag-
nitude, the latter of which perhaps would have gained
statistical significance with increased study power; there-
fore, this result is not necessarily indicative of CBVD
risks at younger ages, but at both < 65 and ≥65 years
old.
Several other time series studies of air pollutants and
hospital admissions have been conducted in Thailand.
Pongpiachan and Paowa [46] examined gaseous air pol-
lutants and in- and outpatients for respiratory disease in
Chiang Mai over 2007–2013 and found the largest posi-
tive association with CO (PM was not analysed). Pothirat
et al. [47] examined admissions in an open-air facility in
Chiang Mai province due to cardiovascular and respira-
tory diseases over 2016–2017; the dataset used was likely
a subset of that in the present study. COPD emergency
visits were found to be raised on both the same and sub-
sequent days (i.e., lag0 & lag1), with hospitalisations in-
creased using lag3. No associations were identified with
cardiovascular disease, as with IHD visits in the current
study. A study in Thailand’s capital, Bangkok, found
comparable increases per 10 μg/m3 of PM10 for total re-
spiratory (1.2%) and cardiovascular (1.0%) admissions as
the current study (2.0%), with some similarities in lag
trends: significant increases on both lag0 and lag4 for re-
spiratory diseases and on lag0 and lag1 for cardiovascu-
lar reasons [48].
In our study, we used the 90th and 95th percentiles of
PM10 concentrations (i.e., 87.1 μg/m3 and 109.6 μg/m3,
respectively) to identify days of biomass burning expos-
ure, which is slightly lower than the 99 percentile
employed by Morgan et al. [35]. A range of other ap-
proaches also have been employed to identify days with
exposure to burning, or haze, including a doubling of
total suspended particulates (mean = 56.9 μg/m3 [49]),
the extent of discoloration in the sky [36], a threshold of
80 μg/m3 to indicate ‘unhealthy’ levels [50], and expos-
ure in the month of March [46]. Other studies of expos-
ure to fires have employed software to track polluted air
mass trajectories based on meteorological data (e.g.,
[51]).
The main corollary of assigning a higher threshold for
days with biomass burning is the potential exclusion of
some days of actual exposure to predominant biomass
burning-derived PM. We did not find evidence that
PM10 on burning days displayed a clear exposure-
response effect, whereas such an association was identi-
fied on non-biomass burning days for CLRD and CBVD
visits. This result conflicts with some previous studies
that have identified biomass burning to either have no
difference [27] or be more harmful [52]. If ours is a
genuine finding, and not due to constrained statistical
power with focussing on higher concentration days,
there are two possible interpretations that are not neces-
sarily mutually exclusive.
 First, PM-derived from biomass burning may be less
harmful than that from other sources (e.g., traffic-
related PM). While not all studies universally dem-
onstrate harmful effects of burning-derived PM in
the short-term, particularly for cardiovascular ad-
missions, many studies do implicate such PM with
causing adverse health [10].
 Second, it might be the case that at higher PM
concentrations, as those used to identify exposure
from biomass burning in the present study, the risk
begins to subside relative to concentration levels, an
effect occurring independently of the source.
Exposure-response trends at higher concentrations
have been shown to vary by health outcome and study.
Qiu et al. [53] present a flattening of the curve between
PM10 and respiratory admissions, though no such miti-
gation was presented by Zhang et al. [54]; however, the
latter authors did show such a pattern for cardiovascular
admissions. Liu et al. [55] found no indication of
curtailed risks at higher concentrations of PM10 for
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke hospitalisations. While
toxicity
studies
have
indicated
potential
differences
based on the type of biomass, such detail is not widely
available for epidemiological data [11]. Another possible
explanation for the lack of an exposure-response effect
on burning days in our study is that individuals might
engage in exposure reduction activities (e.g. staying in-
doors, wearing a face mask) due to more awareness of
poorer air quality during periods of biomass burning
[56]. Ultimately, research in other settings with im-
proved assessment of exposure to biomass burning
would add clarity to the underlying mechanism and
magnitude of risk level.
All of the pollutants in our study (i.e., PM10, CO, O3,
NO2) were at least moderately correlated, which pre-
sented a challenge to parse out independent effects of
each on health. Adjusting for CO increased risk coeffi-
cients for both respiratory and cardiovascular outpatient
visits; this pattern implies that PM10 acts independently
of CO. With the high correlations of PM10 with O3 and
NO2, we were unable to quantify effects of PM10 inde-
pendently of these pollutants. A review investigating ef-
fects of NO2 and PM on hospital admissions found NO2
to entail independent health effects [57], so unadjusted
PM10 estimates might also reflect some contribution
from NO2.
Mueller et al. Environmental Health           (2020) 19:77 
Page 9 of 12
Our study has several strengths, including a popula-
tion of over 5 million people with over 75,000 out-
patient admissions and multiple seasons of biomass
burning with which to analyse associations with ex-
posure. Further, our study provides insights on the
health effects from exposure to biomass burning in a
Southeast Asian context, which is, to date, an under-
represented geographical area [10]. Nonetheless, there
are several limitations to address that might have af-
fected our study findings and interpretation. We used
outpatient hospital data, but were unable to exclude
scheduled visits. As these would have been planned in
advance and thus not affected by air pollution levels
on the visit date, they may have diluted statistical as-
sociations, especially if such visits were cancelled on
account of high ambient air pollution levels [58]. For
exposure assessment, we relied on a limited number
of fixed monitors to capture daily PM10 levels. While
this source would provide poor spatial resolution, it
would be sufficient to reflect temporal variation for
time series investigations, given concentrations of the
same pollutant at different sites were found to be
correlated well in time [59]. As we used levels of
PM10 to identify biomass burning exposure, and not
specific indicators (e.g., levoglucosan [60]), we may
have misclassified such exposures. We did not exam-
ine the composition of PM10 or conduct source ap-
portionment of PM mass, which would have allowed
more refined characterization of PM from biomass
burning. Using the 90th/95th percentile would restrict
exposures to the higher range, reducing the number
of events and thus statistical power. In addition, as
highlighted previously, we employed a threshold, so
we were unable to distinguish potential attenuation
by PM source (i.e., biomass burning) or by virtue of
higher concentration levels.
Conclusions
We conducted a time series study examining the ef-
fects of PM10, including that predominantly from bio-
mass burning, on outpatient hospital visits in the
upper north of Thailand. Consistent with current evi-
dence,
we
found

Our results regarding the health hazards of exposure
to biomass burning PM10 should be confirmed in
other settings and exposure levels, along with identi-
fying specific types of biomass; PM constituent and

of

effects
should be evaluated more definitively in future re-
search. We advise implementing measures to discour-
age burning and lessen overall PM exposures in areas
where such large-scale activities occur.

Open burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a poorly-characterized and frequently-underestimated
source of air pollution in developing countries. This paper estimates the quantity of MSW that was
burned in ﬁve erstwhile municipalities of the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. A household survey, a transect
walk survey, an experiment to measure the fraction of waste that is combustible, a survey on fraction
of population burning waste outside their houses, and a survey of the fraction of MSW burned at dump
sites were performed in this study, whereas burning/oxidation efﬁciency, municipal populations, MSW
generation rates, and emission factors were derived from the literature. The total mass of MSW burned
during 2016 is estimated to be 7400 tons (i.e., 20 tons/day), which was of 3% of the total MSW generated
in the valley municipalities that year. This exceeds Government estimates by a factor of three.
Multiplying the burned MSW mass by emission factors, the air pollutant emissions are estimated as
PM2.5 55 tons (OC 42 tons and EC 1.4 tons), PM10 60 tons, BC 25 tons, CO2 11,900 tons, CH4 30 tons,
SO2 5.0 tons, NOx 19.2 tons, CO 630 tons, NMVOC 112 tons, and NH3 5.7 tons per year. Open burning
of MSW can trigger health impacts such as acute and chronic respiratory disease, heart diseases, and
allergic hypersensitivity, in addition to impacts on local climate. Improved waste-segregation practices
at the source and waste-collection systems throughout the valley are needed to mitigate this pollution
source and its effects.

1. Introduction
Solid waste management (SWM) has become a major concern,
especially in urban areas of developing countries. Many municipal-
ities are experiencing extreme environmental degradation as well
as public health risks due to ill-timed waste management and
unsanitary disposal practices (Alam et al., 2008; Nagpure et al.,
2015). Recently, the open burning of solid waste was implicated
as a major cause for soiling the Taj Mahal and impairing the health
of Agra residents (Lal et al., 2016). In Nepal, population growth,
rapid expansion of sprawling urban municipalities, increasing
amounts of industrial and commercial activity, and rising con-
sumption of packaged goods has resulted in severe air and water
quality issues, poor sanitation, and the spread of diseases (Alam
et al., 2008; Dangi, 2009; Pokhrel and Vivaraghavan, 2005).
At an elevation of 1400 m, the bowl-shaped Kathmandu valley
lies at the foothills of the Himalayas and is surrounded by moun-
tains and forests. The total urban area of Kathmandu valley is
96.68 km2 (KVDA, 2017) and this area has the highest population
density in Nepal. The valley contains ﬁve densely-inhabited urban
centres which were previously designated as municipalities: Kath-
mandu Metropolitan City (KMC), Lalitpur Sub-Metropolitan City
(LSMC), Bhaktapur, Kirtipur and Madhyapur Thimi. Around the
time of study, the Government of Nepal designated 16 municipal-
ities (dividing many of the earlier ﬁve into smaller areas) in the
valley partly in response to the booming urban population
(KVDA, 2017).
Fig. 1 contains a map of the ﬁve original municipalities referred
to throughout this study and their location within Nepal. KMC is
home to the nation’s capital and is the most populated municipal-
ity in Nepal with an area of 49.45 km2 (CBS, 2013) subdivided into
35 wards (KMC, 2014). LSMC was the country’s third most popu-
lous municipality and is located in the south-central part of the
valley, covering an area of 24.94 km2 that was subdivided into 30
wards (LSMC, 2016). Bhaktapur is an ancient city in the eastern

part of the valley, 16 km east of the KMC centre. It was divided into
17 wards and covered only 6.88 km2 (Bhaktapur Municipality,
2016). Kirtipur municipality is less populated than the others and
has grown around another ancient kingdom southwest of the
KMC centre. Madhyapur Thimi is the newest of the ﬁve municipal-
ities, which resulted from population inﬁll between Bhaktapur and
KMC.
Although Kathmandu valley is the most developed place in
Nepal and covers the largest number of commercial and institu-
tional sectors, the SWM in much of the valley remains unsatisfac-
tory. In Kathmandu, SWM has become a chronic problem that has
challenged and evaded development efforts for decades (Dangi,
2009). Many statistics related to SWM in Kathmandu valley are
highly uncertain, as evidenced by the large variability across stud-
ies (Nippon Koei Co. Ltd. and Yachiyo Engineering Co. Ltd., 2005;
SWMRMC, 2008; Dangi et al., 2011). A brief summary is provided
here with the acknowledgement that these data are not necessarily
consistent with each other.
About 50% of the waste from municipalities of Kathmandu val-
ley is generated by households, 43% from commercial, 6% from the
institutional, and relatively little (1%) from parks and gardens,
street sweeping, and from neighboring villages (ADB, 2013). In
2012, the average per capita municipal solid waste generation
rates (MSWGR) for KMC, LSMC, Kirtipur, Bhaktapur and Madhya-
pur Thimi were 0.46 kg/capita/day (kcd), 0.37 kcd, 0.25 kcd, 0.35
kcd, and 0.27 kcd, respectively. The most recent study (SWMTSC,
2015) showed the average MSWGR for a sub-urban neighborhood
of KMC (i.e., Budanilkantha) and LSMC (i.e., Mahalaxmi/Gwarko) in
2014 to be 0.48 kcd and 0.36 kcd, respectively. Comparing ADB
(2013) to the past studies (Nippon Koei Co. Ltd. and Yachiyo
Engineering Co. Ltd., 2005; Alam et al., 2008), the per capita
MSWGR has increased steadily in the valley municipalities. This
is likely due to increased consumption of packaged goods and
gradual rise of commercial and industrial activities. Moreover, a
research-grade study by Dangi et al. (2011) indicates that the
MSWGR is even higher than all of the aforementioned reports.
Although 71% of MSW generated in Kathmandu is organic (Dangi
et al., 2011), very few neighborhoods have systems in place to com-
post this material (Sherpa, 2017). Within the valley municipalities,
only 35.3% of waste from Kirtipur, Madhyapur Thimi (52.2%), LSMC
(71.2%), Bhaktapur (86.5%) and KMC (86.9%) are collected (ADB,
2013). The situation in other low-income countries appears to be
similarly abysmal despite the sizeable expenditure of ﬁnancial
resources on SWM (World Bank, 2012; Hazra and Goel, 2009). At
present, urban areas receive more attention for MSW open burning
because they are highly populated (Wang et al., 2017).
Large quantities of uncollected waste can be found along the
banks of urban waterways such as Bagmati and Bishnumati
(Pokhrel and Vivaraghavan, 2005). The water from these rivers is
used for domestic purpose, cultivating agriculture and also has
religious signiﬁcance for Hindus. Sometimes uncollected waste is
found in close proximity to small-scale agricultural ﬁelds where
it contaminates the food supply. In communities that are far from
waste-collection
routes
(Subedi,
2016),
refuse
is
commonly
dumped in privately-owned lots that are neither developed nor
maintained (Bajracharya, 2016). Any waste that remains uncol-
lected after a few weeks of biodegradation emits a foul odor,
prompting
nearby
residents
to
burn
it
(Bajracharya,
2016;
Sherchan, 2016).
At this point, it is useful to note that the primary issue discussed
in this paper is from MSW that is burned in the open, where com-
bustion conditions (i.e., low temperature, suboptimal air-to-fuel
ratio, high moisture content) are favorable to pollutant formation
(Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). This paper provides no commentary

about the high-temperature, carefully-controlled incineration that
is practiced in some developed countries. Open burning of MSW
has a major impact on human health because the emitted smoke
contains life-threatening particulate matter (PM) enriched in
organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), carcinogenic diox-
ins, and numerous other harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides
(NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane
volatile organic compound (NMVOC) (Nagpure et al., 2015;
Guttikunda et al., 2014; Guttikunda, 2007; Hodzic et al., 2012;
Wiedinmyer et al., 2014; Pokhrel and Vivaraghavan, 2005). High
exposure to PM may lead to respiratory and cardiovascular disease,
cancer and adverse birth outcomes (McDonnell et al., 2000). It also
exacerbates local/regional warming because the carbon dioxide
(CO2) and black carbon (BC) emitted from burning both have a high
global warming potential. Even if it is dumped and never burned,
the gradual degradation of MSW emits methane (CH4) which is
another potent greenhouse gas. MSW open burning also emits
ammonia (NH3) which can enhance the formation of PM in the
atmosphere.
Unlike vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, the common
public and elected ofﬁcials are relatively unaware of the signiﬁ-
cance and harmful impacts of open burning (Sherchan, 2016). In
the few emission inventories that have been made, open burning
of MSW is either completely neglected (Pradhan et al., 2012) or
very crudely estimated (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014; Gautam, 2006).
This is mainly because of the difﬁculties and large uncertainty in
estimating how much MSW is actually burned (Nagpure et al.,
2015). The only urban-scale estimate of emissions from open burn-
ing of MSW in Kathmandu was made a decade ago and it arbitrarily
assumed that 1% of the waste generated is burned (Gautam, 2006).
Other sources of uncertainties are: (i) emissions factors; (ii) activ-
ity parameters such as the fraction of population that burns their
waste and the fraction of waste that is combustible; and (iii) spatial
allocation of waste-burning activities. The purpose of the present
study is to constrain some of these uncertainties so that the impor-
tance of MSW burning relative to other air pollution sources in
Kathmandu Valley may be better understood.
2. Data and methods
This study estimates the MSW open burning in selected urban
and sub-urban neighborhoods of Kathmandu valley, following a
method that was successful in Delhi and Agra (Nagpure et al.,
2015).
2.1. Preparation of ﬁeld surveyors
Surveyors selected for this study received an orientation from
the project scientists. A pilot-scale survey was conducted and
repeated until the surveyors were conﬁdent and skilled enough
to collect their ﬁeld data independently.
A ﬁeld study was conducted from April to June 2016 in seven
selected portions of KMC including Budanilkantha, LSMC, and
Bhaktapur municipality. The study areas included Kalimati/Dallu
(core) and Baneshwor (core) of KMC; Budanilkantha (sub-urban);
Lagankhel (core) and Mahalaxmi/Gwarko (sub-urban) of LSMC;
and Sukuldhoka/Durbar square (core) and Kamalbinayak/Chya-
masingha (sub-urban) of Bhaktapur municipality. Within these
seven study areas, household surveys and transect walks were con-
ducted along a total of 19 different routes (Fig. 2).
2.2. Estimation of the waste combustible fraction
The ﬁeld based experiment on waste combustible fraction (d)
was carried out using ﬁve samples of MSW found in Kirtipur near
Tribhuvan University. The samples were the mixture of household
and commercial waste. First, the composition of each pile was
noted by visual inspection. Second, initial mass of MSW was mea-
sured using a digital weighing balance. Third, the volume of each
MSW pile was determined using a measuring tape and stick (e.g.,
length, width and height). Fourth, the different waste piles were
ignited and carefully monitored until the combustible material
had turned to ash. Fifth, the volume of each pile after combustion
was measured as described above. Lastly, the burnt trash (ash) and
the residual trash were segregated carefully and their masses were
measured separately.
The burnt mass of MSW was calculated by subtracting the mass
of residual trash left after combustion from the total initial mass.
The ratio of burnt mass of MSW to total initial mass of MSW is
referred to as the waste combustible fraction (IPCC, 2006).

Burnt Mass of Trash
Total initial mass of Trash
ð1Þ
This experimentally-derived parameter was used in the subse-
quent calculations of MSW open burning.
2.3. Transect walks
In each of the seven study areas, the available major pathways
to access the market centre were selected as routes for the transect
walks. A distance-sampling approach (i.e., line transect method)
was adopted (Nagpure et al., 2015) along each of the 19 routes.
Each time a pile of waste was encountered along a transect, the
surveying team recorded the geographical coordinates of that pile,
and measured the dimensions (i.e., length, breadth and height) of
the entire pile so that the total volume could be estimated. The
study team took a digital photograph of each waste pile and
recorded the time at which it was observed. A few days later, the
identical transect walk was repeated a second time to determine
whether some of the unburned waste piles were being collected
or burned to ash and if new waste piles were introduced. The total
number of waste piles was the sum of initial waste piles number
from the ﬁrst transect walk and new waste piles found during
the second transect walk.
2.4. Household survey
While traversing each study route and observing waste piles,
household surveys were also conducted. Thus, the sample size
was determined based on the number of routes, household density
and the size/length of each routes of urban core and sub-urban
area. On routes with a sparse settlement pattern, every ﬁfth house-
hold was selected for the survey starting with the ﬁrst household
along each route (i.e., 1, 6, 11, etc.). Along more densely-
populated routes, approximately every tenth household was sur-
veyed (i.e., 1, 11, 21, etc.). In this manner, a total of 179 households
were surveyed (29, 35, 28, 16, 25, 23 and 23 in Kalimati/Dallu,
Baneshwor, Budanilkantha, Lagankhel, Mahalaxmi/Gwarko, Bhak-
tapur core, and Bhaktapur sub urban respectively). Residents
reported the number of occupants in their household, frequency
of waste collection from their home, and their most common
waste-disposal practices (e.g., dump, burn, compost, and/or give
to collector).
2.5. Estimation of the fraction of population burning MSW
During transect walk, the total number of waste piles and burn-
ing incidence along the study routes were identiﬁed and noted
down. Simultaneously, household surveys were conducted to
know the status of total population residing in waste piles burning
route and whether they were participating to the waste collection

483
services. Those who were not participating to waste collection ser-
vices, the information of their methods of waste management
practices (e.g., bury, burning, and composting) were obtained
while interviewing. The household perception data of waste burn-
ing was then tabulated. Fraction of population burning MSW (Pfrac)
was estimated, which the ratio is of population who is not partic-
ipating at waste collection to population whose waste is collected
for disposal or landﬁlling (IPCC, 2006). From the above statement,
population who was not participating at waste collection services
is assumed to burn their waste. The Pfrac was correlated with
observation-based waste piles burning incidence through transect
walk (i.e., waste piles burning per household).
2.6. Estimation of the fraction of MSW burning at disposal sites
To know the status of waste that was really dumped or burnt in
the disposal site (k), waste collection vehicles were tracked from
waste collection points to disposal points in all the study routes.
Study team visited to each waste collection points before 5:00 in
the morning. To track the vehicles, motorbikes were used. Before
heading to this study, different stakeholders (i.e., Department of
Environment, KMC, Teku; Department of Environment, LSMC,
Balkumari; Bhaktapur municipality; and locals) were consulted
about the waste collection vehicle types, time, routes, frequency
of collection, and availability of drivers. After the vehicles have
been followed, visual inspection was made thoroughly at the dis-
posal sites to check whether there were any signs of MSW open
burning practices. Moreover, digital photographs were taken for
visual estimation in the data analysis later.
2.7. Municipal solid waste generation
The series of study on MSWGR are not conducted in the munic-
ipality level in Nepal. The most widely used studies are reported to
be SWMTSC (2015), ADB (2013), Dangi et al. (2011), SWMRMC
(2008), Alam et al. (2008), and Nippon Koei Co. Ltd. and Yachiyo
Engineering Co. Ltd. (2005). For this study, ADB (2013) and
SWMTSC (2015) were considered because those are the latest stud-
ies and contain information of all municipalities which were
studied.
2.8. Emission estimation method
The emissions from MSW open burning of valley municipalities
were
calculated.
To
calculate
MSW
burned
at
source
and
disposal sites of the urban and sub-urban neighborhood of valley
municipalities, guidelines from different literatures were used
(e.g., Shrestha et al., 2013a,b; IPCC, 2006; Shrestha, 2014).

of waste disposed at a disposal site; d is fraction of combustible
MSW, and g is burning/oxidation efﬁciency (fraction).
2.8.3. Emissions
The total emission from MSW open burning can be estimated by
multiplying activity data with emission factors (Shrestha et al.,
2013a,b; IPCC, 2006; Shrestha, 2014; Defra, 2009). Generally, emis-
sion factor is expressed as grams of pollutant emitted per kilogram
of fuel burned. The activity data (e.g., MSW generations) are the
baseline for the emission estimation. The emissions for valley
municipalities were estimated using equation (4) as reported by
the above literatures.
Emi ¼ Ms  EFi
ð4Þ
where Emi is emission of pollutant i; EFi is emission factor of pollu-
tant i; Ms is amount of MSW burned.
The emission factors (EFs) presented in this paper is obtained
from various literatures (i.e., country’s speciﬁc as well as global
based measurement). For estimating the mass of MSW open burn-
ing, EFs for CO, CO2, NOx, BC, PM2.5, CH4, OC, NH3, and EC were
obtained
from
the
recently
on-ﬁeld
measurements
during
NAMASTE campaign in Nepal (Stockwell et al., 2016; Jayarathne
et al., 2018). Because of lack of country speciﬁc EFs for SO2, global
EF was considered which is a laboratory based measurement
(Akagi et al., 2011). Moreover, EFs for PM10 and NMVOC were
selected which is also a global based measurement (USEPA, 1995).
2.9. Data analysis and presentation
The computational tool such as MS-Excel was used to compile
and analyse the data, whereas, R-Studio and Google earth were
used to present the results. R-Studio is free and open-source soft-
ware, which is used for data analysis, developing various graphics
and modelling the ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of environment, ecology,
soil science and other scientiﬁc disciplines. In this study, R-studio
is used for outlining per capita waste burnt accordingly geographic
location of each study sites. Moreover, Google earth is used for
delineating study routes and waste burning points. Arc-GIS is also
used for presenting the study map.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Population demography
The numbers of households counted along the study routes are
shown in Table 3. Their population is determined using the average
household size calculated from the survey results. The data of
urban population for 2011 and projected population for 2016 for
Nepal were 4,523,821 and 5,552,712 respectively (CBS, 2014a,b).
The total population of 2011 for KMC, LSMC, Kirtipur, Bhakatapur
and Madhyapur Thimi was 1,426,641 (CBS, 2012). Based on the
above information, the projected population for 2016 for valley
municipalities is estimated to be 1,751,114.
3.2. Waste combustible fraction
The waste combustible fraction was determined experimentally
(see Section 2.2). Values ranged from 0.53 to 0.66 with an average
of 0.57 (Fig. 3). From visual inspection, the waste piles were esti-
mated to be 50% organic, 30% plastic, 10% paper, 3% rubbers, 2%
metals, 2% textile, 1% glass and 2% other material. Moreover, sam-
ple organic waste piles were wet, whereas rest fractions were dry.
Waste combustible fraction experiment was carried out immedi-
ately after rain disappeared. Thus, the results were based on all
the aforementioned factors.
The experimental value presents the real-world emission
parameter of Kathmandu valley municipalities, which is not
adopted by any national study yet. As a pilot study, the experiment
was limited to one site and ﬁve samples. As all ﬁve municipalities
lie together which shares the same geographic boundary and sim-
ilar socio-economic activities, lifestyles and climatic condition, the
waste composition of each municipality is not expected to vary
greatly. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the average
waste combustible fraction value (0.57) determined in Kirtipur
can be applied to all valley municipalities.
3.3. Estimation of the fraction of population burning MSW
To calculate MSW open burning emissions, fraction of popula-
tion burning MSW is fundamental. The Pfrac was calculated for

the valley municipalities referring the survey data. Of 179 house-
holds sampled, the average value of Pfrac was 0.13 (Table 3). Pfrac
for Budanilkantha was comparatively higher than any other neigh-
borhood. This could be due to irregular waste collection services
because of less accessible, narrow and sloped roads to reach many
of these homes. Higher value of Pfrac infers higher waste burning or
low waste collection efﬁciency in the neighborhoods. To validate
Pfrac with transect walk (i.e., waste piles burning per household),
coefﬁcient of correlation was calculated which is 0.88. Pfrac has a
strong correlation with MSW open burning along the transect line
(Fig. 4). To some extent Lagankhel has a distinct case. In Lagankhel,
some people burn waste in front of their houses and some burn at
the nearest temporary informal dumping site (e.g., Lagankhel Bus
Park). This could be the reason Pfrac and MSW open burning inci-
dence (e.g., waste piles burning per household) along transect of
Lagankhel are feebly allied and coefﬁcient of correlation to not
exceed 0.88.
3.4. Estimation of the fraction of MSW open burning at disposal sites
All the waste that was collected through vehicles was tracked
up to the ﬁnal transfer station and disposal sites. The observations

have been made for each selected informal dumping site. The
burning practices have not been identiﬁed in the disposal sites.
The fraction of MSW-burned at the dumping sites is assumed as
zero.
3.5. MSW open burning and emissions
Of 319 waste piles that have been identiﬁed (Tables 1 and 2),
137 (i.e., 43%) waste piles were found to be actively burning in dif-
ferent routes of the urban and sub-urban area (Fig. 5) of Kath-
mandu valley. Along transect of 1131 households study, the total
mass of waste pile burnt is estimated to be 72 kg/day (Table 3).
The highest waste burning was prevailing in Budanilkantha
(0.027 kcd) followed by Mahalaxmi/Gwarko (0.017 kcd), Lagankhel
(0.014 kcd), Baneshwor (0.012 kcd), Bhaktapur sub-urban (0.008
kcd), Kalimati/Dallu (0.006 kcd), and Bhaktapur core (0.003 kcd)
(Fig. 6).
The household survey of Budanilkantha depicts a waste collec-
tion frequency to be very low (e.g., three times a week to twice a
month). In contrast, Kalimati/Dallu and Baneshwor, which are
the municipality core of KMC have low per capita waste burning
because of higher waste collection efﬁciency (i.e., 86.9%), reported
by ADB (2013). Mahalaxmi/Gwarko which is another sub-urban of
LSMC has higher per capita waste burning and Pfrac for the similar
reason. The waste collection frequency as per survey is one to three
times a week. In contrast, Lagankhel (i.e., municipality core of
LSMC) has comparatively lower per capita waste burning, which
closely relates with high waste collection efﬁciency (71.2%),
reported by ADB (2013) and based on the survey (i.e., seven days
a week). As compared to sub-urban neighborhoods, Bhaktapur core
has lower per capita waste burning. This could be due to higher
waste collection efﬁciency (i.e., 86.5%), reported by ADB (2013).
To know the status of waste that was really dumped or burnt in
the dumping site, vehicles were tracked by surveyors followed by
visual inspection and digital photographs. In this way, the fraction
of MSW burned at the disposal sites were determined as zero.
The total mass of MSW burned during 2016 for valley munici-
palities is estimated to be 7400 tons (i.e. 20 tons/day), which was
of 3% of the total waste generated in that year. This result is com-
pared with similar south Asian cities as well as other developing
and developed countries. The mass of MSW burned is higher than
other developed countries. European Union and United States
determined MSW open burning rates around large cities, which
are in between 0.25% and 0.3% of the total MSWGR (Park et al.,
2013). The MSW burning of valley municipalities is 131,377, 197,
48, 11, 5, and 4 folds lower than global estimates, Mexico City,
Mumbai, Delhi and Agra, Kanpur, and Ulaanbaatar respectively
(Table 4). In Mexico City, MSW open burning is high (i.e., >50%)

in the poorest area (Hodzic et al., 2012). The global waste burning
status is presented by Bond et al. (2004). According to it, Asia con-
tributes 14 Tg/year, Africa (5 Tg/year) and global (33 Tg/year). This
result is inconsistent with Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) which states
MSW open burning to be 972 Tg/year after summing-up residential
and dump sites burning. The waste burning varies from places and
occurs due to variety of reasons. It is more frequent where waste
collection
services
are
sparse,
expensive,
and
unavailable
(Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). Small and medium level cities, and cities
without landﬁll facilities and with no or partially waste collection
service causes more MSW open burning (Guttikunda et al., 2014).
Other reasons are lack of adequate waste collection services
(Ramaswami et al., 2016) as well as irregular waste collection ser-
vices, inept disposal methods, and poor attitude of dump-burn
practices which lead to MSW open burning in residential and open
spaces. Moreover, proper waste recycling systems are also triﬂing
in the country. In average, the waste collection frequency in the
Kathmandu valley is three times a week (SWMTSC, 2015).
This study estimates the total emissions from MSW open burn-
ing to be PM2.5 55 tons (OC 42 tons and EC 1.4 tons), PM10 60 tons,
BC 25 tons, CO2 11,900 tons, CH4 30 tons, SO2 5.0 tons, NOx 19.2
tons, CO 630 tons, NMVOC 112 tons, and NH3 5.7 tons per year
(Fig. 7). The results have been compared with existing estimates
from Diesel Generator (DG) sets, vehicle trafﬁc, and manufacturing
industries of different years to establish MSW burning as a leading
in the valley. World Bank (2014) reported DG sets emission for
Kathmandu valley for 2012/2013. The estimates of SO2, NOx, CO,
PM10, BC, OC and CO2 from MSW open burning are 11, 281, 2, 6,
9, 3, 18 folds lower than DG sets emissions respectively. Comparing
waste burning emission with vehicular emission, NOx is 834 folds
lower, CO is 49 folds lower, BC is 86 folds lower and CO2 is 130
folds lower than reported by Shrestha et al. (2013a,b). Comparing
with manufacturing industries (Pradhan et al., 2012), MSW open
burning emits SO2 and NOx which are 607 and 44 folds lower
respectively. However, CO and NMVOC are 1.6 fold and 2 folds
higher respectively than manufacturing industries (Table 5).
Moreover, emissions from this study are compared with other
regional and international ﬁndings. The emissions such as SO2,
NOx, CO, PM10, and PM2.5 resulted from trash burning from valley
municipalities are 80, 104, 44, 128 and 97 folds lower than Delhi
respectively. Similarly, SO2, NOx, CO, and NH3 are 146, 209, 96

and 256 folds lower than Mexico City respectively. Furthermore,
PM10 and PM2.5 are 68 and 56 folds lower than Ulaanbaatar respec-
tively. Likewise, SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, CH4, BC, OC, CO2, PM2.5 and
NH3 are 97,219, 189,375, 58,649, 194,438, 121,936, 25,793,
121,409, 118,576, 173,859, and 191,027 folds lower than global
estimates respectively (Table 6). Some other study shows that
MSW burning contributes direct PM emissions, approximately 8%
in India, 22% in China, 33% in Bangladesh, and 69% in Pakistan
(Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). In Mumbai, waste burning and landﬁll
ﬁres emit 22,000 tons per year of air pollution in the form of PM,
HC, CO, NOx, and SO2 including dioxins/furans (10,000 TEQ grams
annually) (Annepu, 2012). These emission can lead to severe health
impact like acute and chronic respiratory disease, heart diseases,
and allergic hypersensitivity (McDonnell et al., 2000) including
impacts on local climate because BC and CO2 having a high global
warming potential.
4. Conclusion
In Nepal, this study for the ﬁrst time attempted to estimate real-
world emission parameters, which have been used for estimating
MSW open burning. Moreover, it also accounts daily waste burning
incidence in the Kathmandu valley. This study presents a clear pic-
ture that more MSW open burning prevails at the sub-urban neigh-
borhoods than the municipality core. This is due to lower waste
collection frequency (or efﬁciency) at sub-urban area than the
municipality core. Pfrac has strong linkage with waste collection
efﬁciency. Higher the waste collection efﬁciency, lower will be Pfrac
and vice versa. This study reveals that open burning practices are
not performed in the municipal designated disposal site.
The method applied in this study can be also replicated to more
neighboring cities of the developing countries to obtain amount of
pollutants from MSW open burning. For the cities of developing
countries, which waste composition and climatic condition are
similar to valley municipalities, the value of emission parameters
can be adopted. As MSW open burning study is very primitive in
Nepal, more research and development are indispensable. More-
over, site speciﬁc waste combustible fraction experiment is recom-
mended for future research work.
Although Government of Nepal enforced SWM act 2011 for bet-
ter SWM practices, it has not achieved satisfactory result yet. Thus,
the result of this study is likely to become a stronger foundation for
SWM policies that valley municipalities including other urban
areas can implement in the immediate future. Amending the act
and incorporating the most effective MSW open burning control
strategy (e.g., increasing waste collection services, improved waste
segregation at the source, improved waste collection systems, ban-
ning MSW open burning in the community level, high penalty
charge for use-throw practices, extending more Kawadi centres
for waste recycling, systematic waste disposal practices, air curtain
incineration practices, and awareness) are the foremost steps to
reduce this pollution and its effects.

Abstract: Coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal made up of small particles, including heavy
metals and radioactive elements, is discarded in open-air landﬁlls where it can be emitted into the
air, contributing to air pollution in the surrounding community. Few regulations exist regarding
the storage, disposal, and transport of coal ash. There is limited research on the health impacts of
coal ash exposure on communities. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of
respiratory symptoms among adults exposed to coal ash and non-exposed adults. A cross-sectional
epidemiological study was conducted among two populations: one exposed to coal ash and one not
exposed to coal ash. Perception of health (p-Value < 0.0001), cough (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) =
5.30, 95% Conﬁdence Intervals (CI) = 2.60–11), shortness of breath (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.56–4.31),
hoarseness (AOR = 4.02, 95% CI = 2.45–6.60), respiratory infections (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.14–2.89),
and mean overall respiratory health score (p-Value < 0.0001) were all statistically signiﬁcantly greater
in exposed adults (N = 231) when compared to non-exposed adults (N = 170). Adults residing near
the coal ash facility were more likely to report respiratory symptoms than the non-exposed population.
More research on the health impact of coal ash and storage regulations needs to be conducted.
Keywords: coal ash; ﬂy ash; coal combustion residuals; coal-burning power plants; respiratory health;

1. Introduction
Coal is a combustible sedimentary rock that is largely formed from plant debris [1]. It is made up
of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, as well as small amounts of various metals and
radioactive materials [1,2]. Coal is mined to meet the needs of the world’s increasing demand for fuel.
Despite eﬀorts to increase natural gas production, coal combustion power plants continue to play a
major role in electricity production [1,3]. Coal-burning power plants generate approximately 27% of
the electricity in the United States [4].
Coal combustion residuals (CCR), the byproduct of coal combustion, consist of small particles
that contain naturally occurring radioactive materials, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and a variety
of heavy metals, including aluminum, arsenic, iron, lead, and mercury [5–12]. In 2017, the United
States produced nearly 111 million tons of CCR, more commonly known as coal ash [13]. Coal ash is
not coal dust, which is the term used to refer to a type of pollution generated from the mining of coal.
The composition and particle size of coal ash are diﬀerent compared to coal dust.
Coal ash is an overarching term that can include ﬂue gas desulfurization solids, boiler slag, bottom
ash, and ﬂy ash [3]. During the coal combustion process, small spherical particles measuring ≤10 µm

in diameter ascend up the stack and are collected on ﬁlters. These small particles are known as ﬂy ash
and account for nearly 40%–70% of coal ash product [3,14]. Although some eﬀort is being made to
reuse coal ash, in 2017, only 64% of coal ash was recycled and used in products such as cement [13].
The coal ash that is not reused gets stored in designated landﬁlls and ash ponds where it becomes
a likely source of pollution [15]. Fugitive ﬂy ash emissions from coal ash storage facilities may be a
signiﬁcant contributor to the concentration of ambient air particulate matter (PM) [16,17].
Although studies on coal ash exposure and human health are lacking, several researchers have
investigated the occupational health hazards of coal ash. Two researchers found that coal ash workers
exposed to high arsenic levels had higher malignancy-caused death and higher rates of cancer mortality
when compared to coal ash workers exposed to “normal” levels of arsenic [18,19]. More recent studies
sought to examine occupational health hazards of working at a ﬂy ash treatment plant compared
to a bottom ash recovery plant. One researcher found that when compared to bottom ash workers,
workers in the ﬂy ash treatment plant had signiﬁcantly higher plasma malondialdehyde [20]. Another
researcher found that ﬂy ash treatment plant workers had more DNA damage when compared to
their bottom ash counterparts [21]. Although a few occupational health studies have been conducted,
epidemiologic studies investigating the impact coal ash has on the surrounding community are
limited [22,23]. Since coal ash landﬁlls and ponds are maintained in residential communities, it is
important to understand community exposure.
The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and illness among
adults living in neighborhoods surrounding a coal-burning power plant with coal ash storage facilities
compared to adults living in a non-exposed environment. The exposed population lives in Louisville,
Kentucky, an area that is consistently ranked by the American Lung Association in the top 25 cities in
the United States for the most particulate matter pollution in the country. We hypothesized that the
adults residing in neighborhoods near the coal-burning power plant with coal ash storage facilities
would have poorer respiratory health and more respiratory symptoms than adults who are not exposed
to coal ash. By characterizing respiratory symptoms in the populations, our analysis begins to ﬁll the
gap in the research literature regarding the potential health eﬀects of coal ash among adults.
2. Methods
In this analysis, we used a cross-sectional questionnaire which was developed by the research team
in conjunction with community members living near the coal-burning power plant. This questionnaire
was used to identify respiratory symptoms and health in an exposed and non-exposed comparison
population.
This study was a community-based mixed methods study (focus groups and a
cross-sectional epidemiological study) that took place in four neighborhoods surrounding a coal-burning
power plant with coal ash storage facilities in Southwest Louisville, Kentucky [22,23]. The exposed
neighborhoods that were included in this study were all within 1/4 to 1/2 miles of the storage facility.
The storage facility, located just east of the Ohio River, is home to one large coal ash landﬁll and ﬁve
ponds, two of which are known to store coal ash. The landﬁll was last estimated to have an elevation
of over 500 feet and a surface area of 110 acres [24]. The main coal ash storage pond, which is located
just 1200 feet from the Ohio River, has a surface area of approximately 40 acres [25]. To compare the
prevalence of respiratory symptoms and illness in the coal ash exposed population, a non-exposed
population without coal-burning power plants or coal ash storage facilities located in Orange County,
Indiana, was chosen.
All methods were approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Review Board (IRB#:
09.0141). Participants were provided a preamble prior to completing the questionnaires. Adults who
ﬁnished the questionnaire and submitted it to the research team were considered to have consented.

2.1. Study Populations
2.1.1. Exposed Group
Exposure was deﬁned as residing in one of the four neighborhoods adjacent to the coal ash
facility. The study encompassed a community-based research design in which residents were recruited
from four neighborhoods surrounding a large coal-burning power plant. The four neighborhoods
included in the study span two zip codes. According to the U.S. Census in 2010, the ﬁrst zip code
region was home to 40,746 people; 63% were white, 76.3% were 18 years or older, 14.3% were 65 years
or older. Additionally, the average household size was 2.41. According to the 2010–2014 American
Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 37.9% of those 25 years and older were at least high school
graduates; the poverty level among these same individuals was 15.7%.
The 2010 U.S. Census reported that the second zip code region was made up of 26,465 people; 86.6%
were white, 75.1% were 18 years or older, 13.6% were 65 years or older, and the average household
size was 2.54. According to the 2010–2014 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, 44.1% of
persons 25 years and older were at least high school graduates, 7.5% were living in poverty.
2.1.2. Non-Exposed Comparison Group
A non-exposed comparison population was chosen from Orange County, Indiana, approximately
60 miles from Louisville, Kentucky. Orange County was chosen because its population has similar
demographics and it is rurally situated, without close proximity to a coal-burning power plant or
coal ash storage facilities. In 2010, the U.S. Census reported that of the 19,840 residents of Orange
County, Indiana, 98.2% were white, 75.4% were 18 years or older, and 15.8% were 65 years or older.
Additionally, the average household size was 2.49. Of the people 25 years and older, 45.1% were at
least high school graduates and 12.2% were living in poverty.
2.2. Collection of Data
Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey of exposed and non-exposed adults.
The questionnaire for the survey was developed by the research team based on results from ﬁve focus
groups that were held with 26 adult community members that lived near a coal-burning power plant
with coal ash storage facilities [22,23]. In addition to the health conditions and symptoms that resulted
from the focus group discussions, health conditions and symptoms that were known to be associated
with exposure to particulate matter were included in the questionnaire. Although the reliability and
validity of the questions were not assessed, the questionnaire underwent pilot testing with a group of
community leaders who provided feedback on the length, time, and appropriateness of the questions.
After the feedback was incorporated, the questionnaire was used for the survey. In order to recruit
community members to participate from each of the four neighborhoods, the research team distributed
informational ﬂyers to residents in the neighborhoods. The ﬂyers informed potential participants
about the study and invited them to participate by ﬁlling out the questionnaire. A central location in
each neighborhood was chosen and written questionnaires were available on on multiple days for
participants to complete on their own. English-speaking adults 18 years and older were included in
this study.
The questionnaire used to sample the non-exposed comparison population was adapted in
order to survey the comparison group in Orange County, Indiana. All demographic, smoking,
health, and symptom questions remained the same, but the questions about coal ash exposure and
behaviors related to coal ash were altered into questions about outdoor health and wellness. Research
team members traveled to a comprehensive health clinic in the community on multiple occasions to
administer the questionnaire. English-speaking adults, 18 years or older, that were visiting the clinic
were invited to complete the questionnaire. This study assessed adults because adulthood exposure to
particulate matter can contribute to respiratory illness and exacerbate symptoms of chronic respiratory
diseases. For example, air pollution exposure increases adulthood risk for both Chronic Obstructive
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3642
4 of 10
Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and emphysema. Respiratory symptoms can greatly disrupt the quality of
life of adults and put them at risk of other health concerns.
2.3. Respiratory Symptoms Questions
The questionnaire that was utilized in this study assessed several respiratory symptoms and
health conditions. To determine the symptoms that exposed and non-exposed participants reported,
we asked “How frequently do you experience: cough, shortness of breath, hoarseness, and respiratory
infections”. Responses consisted of never, sometimes, and frequently. For this analysis the symptoms
were dichotomized as “never” and “sometimes/frequently”. To determine whether a participant had
asthma, allergies, or other lung diseases, we asked “Have you ever been told by a doctor or health care
provider that you have (circle Y if Yes)”. Participants who were told by their health care professional
that they had these health conditions circled a “Y”. For this analysis, health conditions were coded as
“1” for yes and “0” for no.
2.4. Data Analysis
Data were statistically analyzed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institue Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The data analysis
included a total of 401 questionnaires from participants; 231 completed questionnaires from the exposed
population and 170 questionnaires from the non-exposed comparison population. SAS 9.4 was used to
examine the prevalence of demographic characteristics and general behaviors of the study populations.
The median age of participants in the exposed and non-exposed groups was compared using a
Wilcoxon median two-sample test. For categorical demographic variables, Pearson’s chi-squared
test was used to compare the proportion of the selected variable between the exposed group and
non-exposed comparison group. Diﬀerences in the prevalence of self-reported respiratory symptoms
and health conditions, including cough, shortness of breath, hoarseness, respiratory infections, asthma,
allergies, and other lung conditions, were assessed between the exposed and non-exposed groups using
Fisher’s exact test or chi-square tests. Logistic regression was utilized to calculate odds ratios. First,
non-adjusted odds ratios and 95% conﬁdence intervals from simple models with just the symptoms and
exposure were determined. Then, ﬁnal models that were adjusted for gender, age, and years of smoking,
were used to report adjusted odds ratios, and 95% conﬁdence intervals. The Cochran–Armitage
two-sided trend test was used to assess if participants who spent more time outside were more likely
to experience respiratory infections.
An overall respiratory health score was created based on self-report of all respiratory symptoms:
cough, shortness of breath, hoarseness, respiratory infections, and asthma, and other lung diseases.
Variables were dichotomized as “0” for never responses and “1” for sometimes or frequently responses.
The overall respiratory health score reﬂects a numeric score for the number of positive responses
of respiratory symptoms. The greater the reported respiratory symptoms the higher the overall
respiratory health score. A Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was used to compare the mean score for the
exposed versus non-exposed comparison group.
3. Results
In the exposed population, 49% of participants lived in their home for >20 years, 30% lived in
their homes for 5–20 years, and 20% lived in their home for <5 years. In the non-exposed population,
23% lived in their homes for >20 years, 36% lived in their homes for 5–20 years, and 42% lived in their
homes for <5 years. Table 1 describes the demographics and general behaviors compared between
the exposed and non-exposed populations. Age, gender, and years smoked were all statistically
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p-value < 0.05) between the exposed and non-exposed groups.
The exposed population had a more even ratio of female to male participants, while nearly
three-fourths of the non-exposed population was female. Additionally, the exposed population
was slightly older, median age was 52 years compared to 43 years for the non-exposed population.
While the exposed population reported having smoked longer compared to the non-exposed population,

other general behaviors like current smoker status and time spent outside were similar between the
two populations.

The population exposed to coal ash was more likely to report having a poorer perception of
health. For example, 46.8% of the exposed population perceived their health as poor or fair (16.2%
and 30.6%, respectively), compared with only 28.8% of the non-exposed population (10.2% and 18.6%,
respectively). The non-exposed population was more likely to perceive their health as very good or
excellent 37.7% compared to 11.4% of the exposed population.
In addition to a poorer perception of health, the exposed group also more frequently experienced
several respiratory irritations and illnesses (Table 2).
The exposed population was more likely to report frequent coughing compared to the non-exposed
comparison group (36.8% vs. 9.2%, p-Value < 0.0001). The exposed group was also more likely to report
frequent shortness of breath (33.6% vs. 9.1%, p-value < 0.0001), hoarseness (15.9% vs. 1.2%, p-value <
0.0001), and respiratory infections (16.8% vs. 2.42%, p-value < 0.0001). On average, participants in the
exposed group reported more respiratory symptoms than the non-exposed comparison group (mean
overall respiratory health score: 3.87 vs. 2.82, p-value < 0.0001).
Table 3 reports the results from the logistic regression modeling. Adults who lived near the
coal-burning power plant with coal ash storage facilities were more likely to suﬀer from cough (AOR =
5.3, 95% CI = 2.60–11), shortness of breath (AOR = 2.59, 95% CI = 1.56–4.31), hoarseness (AOR = 4.02,
95% CI = 2.45–6.60), respiratory infections (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.14–2.89), and allergies (AOR = 1.62,
95% CI = 1.02–2.58).
A gradient response of respiratory infections by time spent outside was assessed in both the
exposed and non-exposed groups (Table 4). Among the non-exposed group, the trend test was not
statistically signiﬁcant. In the exposed group, participants who spent more time outside were more
likely to report having a respiratory infection (p-value = 0.0004).

4. Discussion
This study found a higher prevalence of cough, shortness of breath, hoarseness, respiratory
infections, and allergies reported per person among participants living near a coal-burning power plant
with coal ash storage facilities compared to a non-exposed group. Additionally, exposed participants
reported more respiratory conditions overall. Furthermore, participants living near coal ash storage
who spent more time outside were more likely to report having a respiratory infection.
Fugitive coal ash emissions from coal ash storage facilities can contribute to ambient air pollution,
which can adversely aﬀect the respiratory system [26]. Coal ash is an emerging environmental threat that
can create increased air pollution in communities surrounding coal ash storage sites. The United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stated that without fugitive dust controls, there could be
exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ﬁne particulate matter in the air at
residences near coal ash landﬁlls [17].
Inhalable particular matter, which is characterized by the aerodynamic diameter reported in
micrometers (µm), are particles less than 10 µm in size, also known as PM10. In recent decades,
a growing body of epidemiological research has been published on the association between ambient air
PM and adverse health outcomes, including those pertaining to respiratory health [16,27–30]. Research
also points to a dose-response relationship as the PM decreases in size; correlation strength increases as
the aerodynamic diameter moves from PM10 to PM2.5 [29,31,32], where PM2.5 is deﬁned as particulate
matter < 2.5 µm. While PM10 and PM2.5 both have the potential to cause damage to tissue, PM2.5
is capable of traveling deeper into the lungs by penetrating the alveolar gas-exchange region. Here,
the particulate matter can enter the blood stream and travel throughout the body.
Limited research has been conducted assessing the respiratory health of populations exposed to
coal ash from coal-burning power plants with on-site coal ash storage facilities. Cho, Cho, Shrivastave
and Kapre (1994) [33] found that workers exposed to coal ash were more likely to report respiratory
eﬀects and Sears and Zierold (2017) [23] found an elevated, but not statistically signiﬁcant odds ratio
for respiratory conditions in children exposed to coal ash compared to children not exposed to coal ash.
The EPA reports that over six million people in the U.S. are exposed to coal ash, but the actual
number may be much higher [34]. Regulations overseeing the disposal, storage, and transport of coal
ash are minimal. In 2015, coal ash became considered a “special waste” and regulations were passed
by the EPA, which set requirements for disposal and storage of coal ash. These regulations included
requiring industry to report fugitive dust emissions. However, in 2018, the regulations were rolled
back, allowing industry and the individual states to regulate their coal ash. Other countries where coal
is a major source of energy have no standards regulating coal ash.
There are several limitations that need to be taken into consideration when discussing the results
of this study. First, while the two source populations were comparable according to the census data,
there were some diﬀerences between participants in the two study groups, speciﬁcally the gender
ratios and years smoked. Just over half of the non-exposed population reported never smoking
compared to 36.3% of the exposed population. Similarly, 25% of the non-exposed population reported
smoking for more than 10 years compared with 36.1% of the exposed population. However, we do
note that both groups did have similar current smoking rates: 31.9% among the non-exposed group
and 34.9% among the exposed group. Diﬀerences between the two groups in the number of years
smoked could also partially reﬂect diﬀerences in the average age of the two groups. Furthermore,
nearly three-fourths of the non-exposed participants were female. It is likely that the comprehensive
health clinic had more female visitors, over-representing women in this population. One study
examining physician-child interaction reported that 80% of the time, the caretaker with the child
was the mother [35], suggesting that women are more likely to accompany their child to a doctor’s
appointment than their male counterpart.
Sampling bias may exist. For this study, we wanted to obtain information from participants who
lived adjacently to the power plants and coal ash storage facilities, therefore, we targeted recruitment in
this population of four neighborhoods. Convenience sampling was used in the neighborhoods adjacent
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 3642

to the power plants. For the non-exposed population, to ensure that we did not get participants who
were exposed to coal ash, we took a convenience sample from a local clinic in a region that was situated
60 miles away from the power plants and in a more rural setting.
Another limitation of this study was that a proxy was used for exposure. Since this study was a
small pilot study and precursor to a much larger coal ash study, living near the coal ash plant was used
as the measure of exposure. The lack of exposure assessment should be taken into consideration when
interpreting the results of this study.
This study assessed self-reported behavior and illness; therefore, recall bias is of concern.
Healthcare personnel did not verify the respiratory conditions reported by the participants. However,
previous research conducted in adult populations has found that self-report is well validated.
Researchers have shown that there was high agreement between self-report and medical report
for many symptoms and conditions [36–39]. Additionally, we expect recall bias to have had little eﬀect
on the results, as the questionnaire included personal health history recall and long-term habitual
behaviors. Furthermore, because some of these behaviors were health-risk behaviors, such as smoking,
the accuracy and truthfulness of the results could be of concern [40]. For example, participants may
underreport rates of smoking because they believe it is socially undesirable. Both surveys of the
exposed and non-exposed populations were anonymous, purposefully excluding personal identifying
information in an eﬀort to alleviate this risk.
A ﬁnal limitation of this study is the potential for selection bias. Participants who may have
had more knowledge about coal ash or more respiratory symptoms may have been more likely to
participate in the study. In order to attempt to reduce selection bias, we invited all the residents of the
four neighborhoods to participate when we were recruiting participants. Additionally, we had tables
set-up in central locations so that participants could answer the questionnaire in open spaces in the
neighborhoods, where anyone could come and ﬁll out the questionnaire.
One strength is that this study was community-based. Multiple community members helped
design the questionnaire and recruit participants. Many researchers have shown that community-based
research is improved by working with community members during data collection. This process
allows for improved accuracy of results when community members are involved [41–45]. A ﬁnal
strength of the study was that the questionnaire was administered at multiple locations and times,
allowing residents to have more opportunities to complete the questionnaire.
5. Conclusions
This study is one of the ﬁrst non-occupational studies to assess respiratory health in adults
exposed to coal ash. Although there are several limitations, the results suggest that living near coal ash
storage sites could be associated with increased respiratory irritation and illness among the exposed
population. Little is known about the health burden that coal ash has on the surrounding community.
The results from this study indicate concern and charge future research to assess the impact of coal ash
on ambient air pollution and the respiratory health eﬀects. Future studies could help to further assess
this relationship by measuring coal ash directly and adjusting for smoking status, years smoked and
other potential confounders.
