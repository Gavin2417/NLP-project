Waste collection services are uncommon in rural areas of low-resource countries, causing waste accumulation 
and subsequent dumping and burning of garbage. Air pollution from household garbage burning, including 
plastics, has been observed in Jalapa, Guatemala in addition to household air pollution (HAP) from cooking. 
Adolescent girls often help with these cooking and household tasks, but little is known about their exposures. We 
characterized 24-h exposures to HAP and household garbage burning in adolescent girls by measuring fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), urinary biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 
bisphenol A (BPA), and phthalates. We recruited 60 girls between 13 and 17 years of age who helped with 
cooking activities and lived with participants of the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. 
We recruited n = 30 girls each from the control (wood-burning stove) and intervention (liquefied petroleum gas 
stove) arms. We also measured real-time kitchen concentrations of BC in 20 homes (33%). PM2.5 and BC were

measured in n = 21 control and n = 20 intervention participants. Median concentrations of personal PM2.5 and 
BC and kitchen BC were lower (p < 0.05) in the intervention arm by 87%, 80%, and 85%, respectively. PAH 
metabolite concentrations were lower (p < 0.001) for all nine metabolites in intervention (n = 26) compared to 
control participants (n = 29). Urinary BPA concentrations were 66% higher in participants who reported using 
cosmetics (p = 0.02), and phthalate concentrations were 63% higher in participants who had reported using hair 
products during the sample period (p = 0.05). Our results suggest that gas stoves can reduce HAP exposures 
among adolescents who are not primary cooks at home. Biomarkers of plastic exposure were not associated with 
intervention status, but some were elevated compared to age- and sex-matched participants of the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).   
1. Introduction 
Household air pollution (HAP) is generated from the use of solid or 
“biomass” fuels (coal, charcoal, wood, animal dung, and agricultural 
crop residues) in open fires or inefficient cookstoves in or near the home 
(Johnson et al., 2021; Zhang and Smith, 2007). The majority of the 
approximately 3.8 billion people impacted by HAP live in low- and 
middle-income countries (LMICs) (Health Effects Institute, 2020). The 
smoke that results from the incomplete combustion of biomass fuels is a 
heterogeneous mixture of harmful air pollutants including fine partic­
ulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and polycyclic aromatic hy­
drocarbons (PAHs)(Arif et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). 
Another form of HAP exposure besides cooking activities is house­
hold garbage burning. This is of particular concern in rural areas of 
LMICs, where there is a general lack of infrastructure for waste collec­
tion facilities (Edjabou et al., 2012; Hiramatsu et al., 2009; Lemieux 
et al., 2004; Ramadan et al., 2022; Wiedinmyer et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 
2016). Waste collection rates in rural LMICs are estimated at 33% (Kaza 
et al., 2018), leaving approximately two billion people worldwide 
without access to formal waste disposal options (Velis and Cook, 2021). 
Waste generation is expected to more than double globally by 2050 if the 
current trajectory is maintained (Kaza et al., 2018), which will certainly 
strain areas already struggling with waste accumulation. 
In Guatemala, HAP from both cooking activities and household 
garbage burning are prevalent. Approximately 50% of the total popu­
lation and 86% of the rural population, including the city of Jalapa, 
primarily relies on “polluting fuel” sources including biomass for 
cooking and heating [dataset] (World Health Organization, 2023). Ac­
cording to the Guatemala Population and Housing Census of 2018, 50% 
of the population of Jalapa burns their household waste on or near their 
property as a primary means of waste disposal [dataset] (National 
Institute of Statistics Guatemala, United Nations Population Fund 
UNFPA, 2018), likely due to the lack of infrastructure for waste man­
agement services. According to Hettiarachchi et al. (2018), only 25% of 
the total population of Guatemala has access to solid waste disposal 
services such as landfills and controlled dumps. Although open burning 
of household garbage presents a convenient way to self-manage waste, it 
increases the risk of harmful pollutant exposures through water, soil, 
and air (Ferronato and Torretta, 2019; Ramadan et al., 2022; Velis and 
Cook, 2021). 
A recent systematic review conducted by Velis and Cook explored the 
potential impacts of residential garbage burning on human health and 
synthesized evidence into eight groups of substance emissions, including 
PM2.5, PAHs, BPA, and phthalates. They found that individuals who 
were routinely in close proximity to burn piles, especially informal 
waste reclaimers (also referred to as “waste pickers”), were at the 
highest risk of exposure to an array of health-damaging air pollutants 
(Velis and Cook, 2021). This has implications for families who burn their 
own trash near their homes, though exposure assessment studies were 
not included in the review. 
PM2.5, BC, and PAHs are products of incomplete combustion gener­
ated from open waste burning and are associated with an array of 
adverse health effects (Arku et al., 2020; Dutta et al., 2020; Woolley 
et al., 2020; Velis and Cook, 2021). The chemical composition of the 
smoke from household garbage burning depends on a variety of factors 
including type of waste burned, environmental conditions, and burn 
frequency (Lemieux et al., 2004). A recent publication by Bardales Cruz 
and colleagues characterized emissions from domestic burning of plastic 
waste across 22 departments in Guatemala. They found that as much as 
30% of organic carbon, 24% of BC, 24% of PM2.5, and 2% of CO2 
emissions in Guatemala might not be accounted for by excluding open 
plastic burning from emissions inventories. Furthermore, the burning of 
plastic waste releases an array of other pollutants of potential health 
concern including ammonium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, antimony, and 
other trace elements (Bardales Cruz et al., 2023). 
Other pollutants generated by household garbage burning are plas­
ticizers and chemical additives such as phthalates and BPA. These 
chemicals are commonly added to plastic products to improve texture 
and rigidity and have the potential to leach into the environment as a 
result of incomplete combustion (Velis and Cook, 2021). Phthalates are 
also added to many consumer products including personal care products 
like soaps and hair products (Benjamin et al., 2017), pesticides, toys, and 
cosmetics (Zhang et al., 2022b). Long-term exposure to phthalates has 
been shown to impact pregnancy (Grindler et al., 2018; Wang and Qian, 
2021), child growth and development, and reproductive systems in 
young children and adolescents (Benjamin et al., 2017; Wang and Qian, 
2021). Exposure to these chemicals can occur through ingestion, inha­
lation, or dermal contact (Benjamin et al., 2017). 
BPA is a plasticizer added to products such as baby bottles, water 
bottles, food and beverage containers, toys, glasses, and CDs (Ma et al., 
2019). Exposure can occur dermally or through the ingestion of food or 
drinks that have been packaged in or come into contact with BPA 
(Cimmino et al., 2020; Geens et al., 2009; Grindler et al., 2018). BPA 
interacts with various biological receptors including estrogen receptors 
and has been associated with breast cancer development (Ma et al., 
2019). Both BPA and phthalates have been proposed in the etiology of 
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adolescent girls (Akgül et al., 
2019). Inhalation exposures are also possible through exposure to 
BPA-containing dust particles or through burning products made with 
BPA, though more studies are needed to understand the associated 
health impacts upon exposure (Abraham and Chakraborty, 2020; 
Vasiljevic and Harner, 2021). 
HAP exposure assessment and health effects studies related to 
cooking practices in Guatemala are abundant in the literature (Johnson 
et al., 2021; McCracken John P. et al., 2007; Pope et al., 2015; Smith 
et al., 2010, 2011; Weinstein et al., 2017, 2020). Women and children 
are the populations typically prioritized in HAP studies because they 
typically spend more time at home and near the stove, compared to men 
(Hollada et al., 2017). However, limited evidence exists in the literature 
of HAP exposure assessment in young adults or adolescents (Huang 
et al., 2019; Murawski et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 
2022a), despite the knowledge that adolescent girls often help with 
household tasks including cooking and garbage burning. HAP exposure 
assessment studies in adolescent girls in LMICs, where residential 
biomass and garbage burning are both prevalent, are even less common 
(Huang et al., 2019). 
Given the ubiquity of plastic waste and the prevalence of HAP and 
household garbage burning in Guatemala, we sought to characterize 
K.A. Kearns et al.

exposures experienced by adolescent girls in Jalapa, Guatemala to 
PM2.5, BC, PAHs, phthalates, and BPA. For this pilot study, we leveraged 
the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) randomized 
controlled trial to recruit girls from the control (biomass stove) and 
intervention (liquefied petroleum gas; LPG stove) arms to compare ex­
posures. We assessed their exposures to PM2.5 and BC, collected real- 
time kitchen area BC concentrations, and analyzed urinary biomarkers 
of exposure to PAHs (markers for both HAP and garbage burning), and 
biomarkers of phthalates and BPA to assess exposures to plastics. We 
also collected survey data to assess other potential dietary, dermal, and 
inhalation exposures to measured pollutants. This pilot study aims to 
address important knowledge gaps in personal exposures to HAP and 
garbage burning in adolescent girls in rural areas of LMICs. 
2. Methods 
2.1. Study setting 
This pilot study was nested within the HAPIN trial, which has been 
described in detail previously (Clasen et al., 2020, 2022; Johnson et al., 
2021) and summarized briefly here. The HAPIN trial took place between 
2017 and 2022 in four LMICs: Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda. 
HAPIN households (n = 3200 total, n = 800 per study site) were ran­
domized into either the control arm, continued use of a biomass stove (n 
= 1607), or the intervention arm, free LPG stove and gas for 18 months 
(n = 1593). The HAPIN trial characterized 24 h personal exposures in 
pregnant women and kitchen concentrations of PM2.5 and BC pre- and 
post-intervention. For this pilot study, we recruited 60 adolescent girls 
residing in HAPIN households at the Guatemala site in rural Jalapa. 
The protocol for this study has been reviewed and approved by 
institutional review boards (IRBs) or Ethics Committees at Emory Uni­
versity (00109014) and Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (198-05- 
2019). The HAPIN trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(Identifier NCT02944682). All participants provided written informed 
consent. 
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
We sought to recruit 60 girls, 30 each from the control and inter­
vention arms. Researchers were blinded to intervention status through 
the data collection period and until a certain stage of data analysis. In­
clusion criteria were female, ages 13–17 years, residence in households 
participating in the HAPIN trial, and routine participation in cooking 
meals at home. Exclusion criteria were known pregnancy, self-reported 
current cigarette smoker, or plans to move temporarily or permanently 
outside the study area during the time of the study. 
2.3. Questionnaire 
In total, 56 of the 60 participants met eligibility criteria for the study. 
Two of the four ineligible participants did not meet age criteria and two 
did not regularly participate in cooking activities. An additional 
participant refused to provide a urine sample, and her instrument also 
failed during the air monitoring period, leaving us with a total sample 
size of 55 participants. Written consent to participate in the study was 
provided by a parent or guardian at the time of recruitment. All eligible 
participants were informed of study objectives, time commitment, 
benefits, and risks of the study. 
Local, trained fieldworkers verbally administered a baseline survey 
questionnaire in Spanish to collect sociodemographic information, 
household and stove characteristics, perception of waste generation and 
disposal in the community, health effects related to HAP exposure, and 
sources of HAP in and outside the home. Another survey was adminis­
tered the following day when urine samples were collected to determine 
potential sources of exposure that occurred during the previous 48 h (24 
h during the monitoring period and the 24 h preceding the monitoring 
period), to best attempt to capture the various exposure types). Re­
sponses were recorded on tablets and saved on REDCap™ (Harris et al., 
2009, 2019). 
2.4. Exposure assessment and sampling strategy 
2.4.1. Personal exposure assessment and laboratory analysis of PM2.5 
Personal exposure to PM2.5 was assessed on all participants using the 
Triplex Personal Sampling Cyclone (Mesa Labs) and Casella Tuff Pro 
pump (Casella, Buffalo, NY, USA). Pre-weighed Teflon filters with a 
diameter of 37 mm (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, USA) were 
loaded into a plastic cassette (SKC Limited, United Kingdom) and affixed 
to the aluminum cyclone. The cyclone and filter apparatus were con­
nected to the pump via tubing. The pump/cyclone system weighs about 
450 g total and was calibrated at a flow rate of 1.5 L min−1. The in­
struments were calibrated before each deployment, and the flow rate 
was recorded at the field station before and after the sampling period to 
determine the average sample flow rate. 
At the start of the sample period in the home, trained field staff 
turned on the air sampling equipment and placed the pump into a small 
backpack. The tube and cyclone were affixed along the strap of the 
backpack such that the filter was placed in the participant’s approximate 
breathing zone. The participant was asked to wear the backpack at all 
times, unless she were to engage in an activity which might damage the 
equipment such as bathing or sleeping and was instructed to keep the 
backpack within a meter of her person during these activities. 
The instruments were stopped by a field technician when they 
returned after 24 h to collect the equipment. The sampling equipment 
was carried back to the field office and filters were removed from the 
cyclones in a clean laboratory. Filters were placed in labeled petri dishes 
and refrigerated at 4 ◦C until they were hand-carried in coolers with blue 
ice by a traveler to the University of Georgia (UGA; Athens, GA, USA) for 
analysis. We followed the HAPIN protocol for gravimetric analysis of 
PM2.5 and optical transmission of BC for personal exposure assessment, 
as described in detail elsewhere (Johnson et al., 2020). 
2.4.2. Measurement of real-time kitchen area BC 
We measured 24-h real-time BC concentrations in the kitchens of 20 
participants (n = 10 control and n = 10 intervention homes) using the 
Model AE51 microAeth Black Carbon aerosol monitor (Aethlabs, Inc., 
range: 0–1 mg m−3, resolution: 0.001 mg m−3, flow rate: 50 mL min−1). 
The microAeth was deployed in the kitchen 0.5 m above the ground near 
the stove and was loaded with a Teflon-coated glass fiber filter strip prior 
to deployment (Pallflex Fiberfilm T60A20, Pall Life Sciences, MI, USA). 
The monitor draws air into an inlet 3 mm in diameter with a built-in 
pump and measures the rate of light absorption as aerosols deposit on 
the filter at a flow rate of 50 mL min−1 and a time interval of 60 s. The 
absorbance of the sample area of the filter is therefore measured once 
every 60 s relative to a reference portion of the filter paper. These pa­
rameters were chosen based on the manufacturer’s instructions to 
optimize performance of the microAeth in this particular study setting. 
The BC data was post-processed using an Optimized Noise-reduction 
Averaging (ONA) algorithm as recommended by the manufacturer. 
2.4.3. Urinary biomarkers of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA 
The phthalates of interest for this study are commonly described in 
the literature (Benjamin et al., 2017; Radke et al., 2020) and include 
metabolites of the parent compounds di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 
(DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), and 
diethyl phthalate (DEP). Thus, the measured metabolites for this study 
were mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), 
mono-2-carboxymethylhexyl phthalate (MCMHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-ca 
rboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phtha­
late (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-2-ethyl-5- 
oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEP), 
mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP).

The metabolites measured in this study include 1-napthol, 2-naph­
thol, 2- and 3-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxypyrene, and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4- 
hydroxyphenanthrene. PAHs like these that are composed four rings or 
less (classified as low molecular weight PAHs) are more readily excreted 
in the urine (Yang et al., 2021), and thus were the target metabolites for 
this study. 
Participants were instructed to collect the first urine in the morning 
at the end of the 24-h sample period in a provided plastic urine collec­
tion container (previously tested to be BPA and phthalate-free). Field 
blanks were collected alongside of urine samples for quality assurance 
purposes to assess potential field contamination. Urine samples were 
collected from all participants when the technicians returned to pick up 
air monitoring equipment. Samples were transported to the field labo­
ratory and were processed within 8 h of collection. Samples were stored 
in the laboratory’s freezer at −20 ◦C until shipment to Emory University 
within 6 months of collection (Atlanta, GA, USA). 
All urine samples were randomized using a Fisher-Yates shuffling 
algorithm prior to analysis to reduce any potential batch effects. A 0.5- 
mL aliquot of urine was spiked with isotopically labeled analogues of the 
target phthalates and phenols and then was subjected to an enzyme 
hydrolysis to liberate glucuronide-bound conjugates. The hydrolysate 
was extracted using an ABS Elut-NEXUS solid phase extraction column, 
eluting with acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. The extract was concentrated 
to dryness and reconstituted in mobile phase for analysis using liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using two 
separate injections and acquisition methods. 
Analyte concentrations were calculated using isotope dilution cali­
bration. Two quality control materials (one high and one low) and one 
blank sample were analyzed concurrently with each set of 28 unknown 
samples. Further quality assurance measures were included in the 
sample analyses including the analysis of NIST SRM 3672 and 3673 (one 
of each per 50 samples), and bi-annual participation in the German 
External Quality Assessment Scheme (G-EQUAS). Specific gravity was 
measured using a refractometer. 
All metabolite concentrations were adjusted for measured creatinine 
concentrations to account for variability in the volume of urine and the 
concentrations of endogenous and exogenous chemicals from void to 
void (Barr et al., 2005). 
2.5. Statistical analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.0 and later (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, 253 Vienna, Austria). We calcu­
lated descriptive statistics for each of the pollutants. For the urinary 
biomarkers (phthalates, BPA, and PAHs; n = 55) we calculated the 
geometric mean (95% confidence interval; CI), median (interquartile 
range; IQR), the 90th and 95th percentiles, and the minimum and 
maximum concentrations. For the air monitoring data (personal PM2.5 
and BC and kitchen BC), we calculated the median and IQR by study 
arm. For PM2.5, we also evaluated the percentage of samples that were 
below the World Health Organization’s Annual Interim Target 1 (IT-1) 
for exposures, which is 35 μg/m3 (World Health Organization, 2021). 
Differences in exposures between assigned treatment arm were 
evaluated using non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon Rank Sum), given that 
the data did not follow the assumptions of normality. Biomarker data 
were natural log-transformed before testing associations between

reported dermal, ingestion and inhalation exposures and measured 
pollutant concentrations using linear regression. 
For the biomarker data, we also compared metabolite concentrations 
of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA between our participants (stratified by 
study arm) and age- and sex-matched participants of the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a U.S.-based survey. 
3. Results 
3.1. Household and participant characteristics 
Household and participant characteristics, as well as exposures to 
HAP and plastics stratified by study arm, are provided in Table 1. Par­
ticipants were split 53% control and 47% intervention. The median age 
for each group was similar (14–15 years), and the majority of partici­
pants (65%) were currently in school. Most participants (98%) reported 
feeling that their community has a waste disposal issue and that there 
was nowhere to properly dispose of accumulated garbage. 
Burning trash was reported to be the preferred method of household 
garbage management by 76% of participants, which was similar be­
tween study arm (79% of control homes and 73% of intervention 
homes). Participants observed the most trash on the main road in their 
respective communities (82%), compared to their own yards, church, 
school, and public land. The most commonly observed types of trash 
reported by participants were snack wrappers (47%) and plastic bottles 
(33%). 
3.2. Participant reported exposures over previous 48 h 
After the 24-h sample period, the field staff returned to collect 
exposure monitors and urine samples and administer questionnaires. At 
this visit, participants were asked to recount their exposures over the 
previous 48 h (during the 24-h sample period as well as the day before 
sampling began). These results are presented in Table 1. 
Nearly all control participants (n = 28; 97%) and nine of the inter­
vention participants (35%) reported that they had been around an open 
fire within the previous 48 h. This could have been interpreted as the 
cooking fire (particularly for control participants), or any other open fire 
inside or outside the home. The average time spent around the open fire 
was 63 min (range: 1–420 min) for control participants and 8 min 
(range: 0–60 min) for intervention participants (results not shown). 
Twelve control (41%) and 1 intervention participant (4%) reported they 
had burned garbage in an outdoor burn pile, and 10 of those 12 control 
participants reported that the trash included plastic. The average 
amount of time spent burning trash among the control participants was 
9 min (range: 1–30 min), and the single intervention participant re­
ported spending 10 min burning trash (results not shown). 
3.3. Urinary biomarkers analysis 
For the biomarkers analysis, one sample was missing due to partic­
ipant refusal to provide the urine sample, resulting in a total sample size 
of 55. Descriptive statistics for BPA, phthalates, and PAH urinary 
metabolite concentrations are provided in Table 3. 
3.3.1. PAHs 
Nine hydroxylated urinary PAH metabolites were analyzed, and re­
sults are shown in Fig. 1. Due to the inability to isometrically separate 
some of the metabolites, 2- and 3-hydroxyfluroene and 2- and 3-hydrox­
yphenanthrene were combined to equal seven total individual mea­
surements. PAH metabolite concentrations were lower (p < 0.001) for 
each of the seven metabolites in intervention compared to control par­
ticipants. Conversely, metabolite concentrations were significantly 
higher in our participants regardless of study arm compared to age- and 
sex-matched participants of NHANES (n = 130), with the exception of 2- 
naphthol, where only the control arm was significantly higher than 
NHANES. 
3.3.2. Phthalates and BPA 
Phthalate and BPA exposures were not statistically different between 
study arms, thus results were pooled and compared to NHANES partic­
ipants (Fig. 2). Metabolite concentrations were elevated (p < 0.001) for 
MBP, MECPP, MEHHP, MEHP, and MEOHP in our participants 
compared to NHANES. We did not observe significant differences be­
tween our participants and NHANES participants for MiBP. For MEP, 
MBzP, and BPA, NHANES levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) 
compared to our participants. 
3.4. Air monitoring data for PM2.5 and BC 
We analyzed personal PM2.5 and BC exposures from 41 participants 
(n = 21 control, n = 20 intervention) and real-time BC in a subset of 20 
kitchens. 
3.4.1. Personal exposures to PM2.5 and BC

(n = 21 control, n = 20 intervention; Fig. 3). Fifteen filters (27%) were 
removed from analysis due to instrument failure and thus, inability to 
determine total sample duration and final concentration. There was a 
significant reduction (Wilcoxon Rank Sum, p < 0.001) in personal PM2.5 
exposures in intervention participants (median 18.5 μg/m3, IQR 
11.1–53.0) compared to control participants (median 145 μg/m3, IQR 
32.0–199). Similarly, there was a significant reduction (Wilcoxon Rank 
Sum, p < 0.05) in personal BC exposures in intervention (median 2.24 
μg/m3, IQR 1.49–3.46) compared to control participants (median 10.0 
μg/m3, IQR 2.77–14.3). Compared to the WHO Annual IT-1 of 35 μg/m3 
for PM2.5, 65% of intervention participants and 29% of control partici­
pants and were below the guideline concentrations. 
3.4.2. Kitchen area BC concentrations 
Due to instrument availability, real-time BC was measured in 20 
kitchens (36%). Kitchen area BC concentrations were about five times 
lower on average in intervention (n = 10) compared to control kitchens 
(n = 10) (Fig. 3). Median concentrations were similar for personal and

kitchen BC concentrations in the control participants (10.0 vs. 11.1 μg/ 
m3) and the intervention participants (2.24 vs. 2.03 μg/m3), despite 
using different instrumentation and sampling methods. 
3.5. Modeling results 
Table 2 summarizes the regression results of associations between 
different dermal, ingestion, and inhalation exposures and measured 
pollutant concentrations. Pollutant concentrations were natural log (ln)- 
transformed given the non-normal distribution of the data. For linear 
regression, ln-transformed pollutants were the dependent (y) variable, 
and the independent (x) variables were participant-reported exposures 
from the survey questionnaire. 
For BPA, concentrations were 66% higher (p = 0.02) in participants 
who reported using cosmetics during the 48-h sample window. No 
additional significant associations were found between BPA and other 
potential sources, although the relationship between burning plastic 
trash in an open fire was associated with elevated BPA concentrations

with nominal statistical significance (62% difference; p = 0.07). 
Phthalate metabolite concentrations were 63% higher in participants 
who had reported using hair products (shampoo, conditioner, hair 
spray, etc.) during the 48-h period. The nine individual phthalate me­
tabolites were regressed with the “hair products” variable and MEOHP 
was specifically associated with hair product use (p = 0.05; data not 
shown). The association between MBzP and hair products was nomi­
nally significant (p = 0.08; data not shown). 
Personal PM2.5 concentrations were 2.84 times higher (p = 0.004) in 
participants who reported having been around an open fire. Concen­
trations were 2.31 times higher (p = 0.02) in participants who had 
burned trash in a burn pile, and 3.32 times higher (p = 0.007) in par­
ticipants who said the burn pile contained plastic trash compared to 
participants who had reported not receiving the same exposures. Results 
are similar and statistically significant (p < 0.05) for personal BC and 
PAH metabolites for the same sources of exposure (see Table 2). 
4. Discussion 
We found that adolescent girls participating in our study had 
significantly reduced exposures to PM2.5, BC, and PAHs in the inter­
vention arm compared to the control arm. We also measured detectable 
levels of phthalate and BPA metabolites in urine samples, some of which 
were higher than our reference NHANES population, and some of which 
were related to burning trash and cosmetics use. 
We observed substantial median reductions of PM2.5 (−86%) and BC 
(−80%) exposures in intervention compared to control participants. 
These findings are consistent with similar studies comparing exposures 
in women who are primary cooks using biomass stoves compared to LPG 
stoves (Grajeda et al., 2020; Johnson et al., 2021; Thornburg et al., 
2022; Weinstein et al., 2020). The results are comparable to the overall 
HAPIN study (Johnson et al., 2021), where a 74% reduction in exposures 
in intervention compared to control participants in Jalapa was reported. 
Intervention participants also had substantially reduced (−72%) 
median urinary PAH concentrations compared to control participants. 
These findings are even more drastic than the 37% reduction found by 
Weinstein and colleagues in pregnant women in rural Guatemala using 
LPG compared to wood (Weinstein et al., 2020). This may be explained 
by the abundant free fuel delivered to homes in the HAPIN trial, while 
other studies limited the provision of free LPG fuel leaving houses to rely 
on a combination of fuels for daily cooking. Chen et al. also found sig­
nificant reductions (p < 0.05) in urinary PAH concentrations in rural 
Chinese participants using LPG compared to wood, although percent 
reductions were not given (Chen et al., 2017). 
Other than inhalation exposure from combustion sources, exposure 
to PAHs can occur through diet, specifically from eating grilled or 
charred foods (Hamidi et al., 2022). Tortillas are a staple food in 
Guatemala, and >50% of control participants and exactly 50% of 
intervention participants reported having eaten charred or burnt torti­
llas in the 48 h prior to urine sample collection. In this study, however, 
we did not find associations between participants’ report of eating 
charred or burnt tortillas and PAH concentrations as we did for PAHs 
and the inhalation exposures. This is consistent with the findings of 
similar studies (Weinstein et al., 2017, 2020). 
BPA exposures in our participants were mainly attributed to general 
cosmetics use (p = 0.02), though borderline significance (p = 0.07) was 
found in relation to burning plastic trash in an open fire. Studies 
measuring BPA exposures in LMICs, especially in the context of HAP, are 
rare in the literature. A recent study that is relevant to ours was con­
ducted by Rodríguez-B´aez et al. (2022) in Mexico, where they measured 
urinary concentrations of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA in 45 indigenous 
women ages 24–79 years. In this study, behaviors that may lend to ex­
posures to the pollutants of interest were smoking (9%), burning 
garbage (98%), using firewood for cooking (100%), and using plastic 
containers for food storage (100%). Median (IQR) creatinine-adjusted 
urinary BPA concentrations were 0.6 (0.4–2.0) μg/g creatinine, which 
is slightly higher than our findings of 0.45 (0.24–0.68) μg/g creatinine. 
In both studies, the urine sample was collected after an overnight fasting 
period (i.e., first morning void). 
The biological half-life of both phthalates and BPA are believed to be 
only about 5 h (Galloway et al., 2018; Genuis et al., 2012; Wittassek and 
Angerer, 2008), meaning that substantial variations in urinary levels are 
likely; moreover, levels that are measured will relate to only current or 
recent exposures (Krishnan et al., 2010). This introduces substantial 
challenges and warrants caution when comparing results to other 
studies, especially ones that vary in design and population. Rodrí­
guez-B´aez’s study differs from ours in that it was an observational study 
without air monitoring data, and no measures of association were re­
ported between urinary metabolite concentrations and the potential 
sources of exposures listed. 
Rodríguez-B´aez et al. (2022) also measured urinary concentrations 
for four of the same phthalate metabolites as our study – MEHP, MBP, 
MiBP, and MBzP – in addition to the BPA already discussed. With the 
exception of MiBP, which was approximately six times higher in our 
participants, the findings of Rodríguez-B´aez and colleagues were orders 
of magnitude higher than ours, and authors also noted that they were 
“impressively higher” than previous reports. In addition to differences in 
metabolism of phthalates in humans, another potential explanation the 
authors present for the high concentrations of phthalates in their study is 
the high prevalence of recycled plastics in the country. Mexico has been 
recognized as a leading recycler of plastics in the Latin America region, 
and recycled plastics are an important source of the parent compound 
DEHP, as it has been shown to be higher in recycled plastics compared to 
first-use plastics (Rodríguez-B´aez et al., 2022). Overall, both our study 
and the Rodríguez-B´aez study underscore the importance of assessing 
exposures in these understudied and vulnerable populations. 
Compared to our reference NHANES population, five of the nine 
urinary phthalate metabolites analyzed (MBP, MEHHP, MEOHP, MEHP, 
and MECPP) were statistically significantly higher in our participants. 
MEHHP, MEOHP, MEHP, and MECPP have the same parent compound 
(DEHP), which is the most common member of the chemical class of 
phthalates and is widely used in plastic products (Carli et al., 2022). 
Participants in our study had variable personal care product and 
cosmetic use, but they reported that their community had no waste 
sanitation services and they observed an accumulation of plastic bottles 
and snack wrappers. These results illustrate the prevalence of plastics 
and their breakdown products in the environment, especially in places 
like Jalapa where municipal sanitation services are largely not available. 
Furthermore, while the United States and many countries of the Euro­
pean Union have restrictions for the use of some phthalates in consumer 
products, such regulatory infrastructure is not in place in many LMICs 
(Wang et al., 2019). 
To our knowledge, this pilot study is the first to conduct compre­
hensive personal exposure assessment to HAP and measure urinary 
metabolites of plastics in adolescent girls in a rural setting where both 
biomass cookstoves and garbage burning are prevalent. Although a 
small study, we were able to leverage the HAPIN trial’s participating 
households, which demonstrated excellent adherence to the LPG stove 
in intervention households (Quinn et al., 2021). Thus, we were able to 
see substantial reductions in the adolescents in the intervention group in 
the air pollutant results for PM2.5, BC, and PAHs, although the urinary 
biomarkers results for BPA and phthalates were less clear. 
Cosmetic (foundation, compact powder, blush, eyeliner, mascara, 
lipstick, eyeshadow, and nail polish) and personal care product use 
during the 48-h time period was highly variable among our participants. 
More than half of our participants (53%) reported that they never use 
cosmetics, and only one participant used some cosmetics on a daily 
basis. Despite this, we were still able to see a relationship between 
cosmetic use and BPA concentrations. 
Lotion, hair products, and deodorant were the personal care products 
used by at least 50% of participants during the sampling timeframe. For 
hair products, we were able to relate exposure to total phthalates and

specifically, to MEOHP, but we did not observe associations between 
any other metabolite and personal care products. The short half-lives 
coupled with variable cosmetic and personal care product use, and 
small sample size of the study, may explain these findings. 
Though we observed substantial reductions in the HAP data by study 
arm (PM2.5, BC, and PAHs), 36% of all participants (n = 20) reported 
burning trash including plastic at a frequency of at least twice per week 
during the baseline survey questionnaire. Whether a participant burned 
trash during our particular sample period was due to chance. Addi­
tionally, for those that reported burning trash within our 48-h sample 
period, they reported spending only about 10 min on average around the 
burn pile. For these reasons, the potential impacts of plastic trash 
burning in the community of Jalapa may not have been adequately 
characterized due to the inability to capture all burning events during 
the specified sample period and in this small sample size. 
This study was an informative pilot study and, to our knowledge, one 
of the most comprehensive in terms of pollutants measured, but we were 
met with several limitations. In addition to the inherent limitations of 
short biological half-lives of some of the metabolites as previously dis­
cussed, this was a small, convenience sample, which may have led to 
either an over- or underestimation of the results. Moreover, cross- 
sectional studies such as ours only capture current exposures during a 
specific window of time and may not be representative of daily, cumu­
lative exposures. The statistical analyses also relied heavily on survey 
data, which is inherently prone to recall and/or social desirability bias. 
Given that BPA can leach into food and drinks, especially when the 
food and drinks are hot and come into contact with BPA-containing 
plastics, a missed opportunity we found with our questionnaire was 
not asking participants whether they had consumed hot beverages such 
as coffee from plastic cups. Furthermore, although we asked about fre­
quency of garbage burning in participants’ households as part of the 
baseline survey questionnaire, garbage burning at any frequency was 
not part of the inclusion criteria, meaning that we only captured burning 
events in the households that happened to take place during the sample 
period. Despite this, we still were able to capture instances of garbage 
burning in our small study population and during the specified sample 
period. These specific limitations have been remedied in the subsequent 
village level cluster-randomized trial which expands upon this work in 
the same region of Guatemala (ECOLECTIVOS; NCT05130632). 
Despite these limitations, this study showed that switching from 
biomass fuels to cleaner fuels such as LPG can significantly reduce ex­
posures to harmful pollutants in young women of reproductive age. 
Cosmetics and some personal care products contributed to BPA and 
phthalate exposures, highlighting the ubiquitous nature of these chem­
icals in everyday products used by young women. More research is 
needed to accurately characterize cumulative exposures to these prod­
ucts in LMICs. Time-activity studies of HAP and household garbage 
burning, especially in these understudied areas, would also help eluci­
date the acute as well as cumulative exposures. Although it was beyond 
the scope of this study, it will be important for future studies to isolate 
the health impacts adolescent girls experience when exposed to air 
pollutants from garbage burning, including plastic. 
5. Conclusion 
This study characterized exposures to HAP from cookstoves and 
garbage burning, including plastic burning, among adolescent girls in 
rural Guatemala. We conducted 24-h personal air monitoring of PM2.5 
and BC and analyzed urinary biomarkers of PAHs, phthalates, and BPA. 
We observed exposure reductions to PAHs, PM2.5, and BC in adolescents 
residing in homes that had been randomized to an LPG intervention 
compared to homes who continued cooking with traditional biomass 
stoves. We observed elevated levels of some urinary phthalate metabo­
lites compared to U.S. participants in NHANES, and found detectable 
levels of BPA, which was associated with cosmetics use. This pilot study 
contributes to an area of the literature that is currently lacking, and 
paves the way for future work, namely the ECOLECTIVOS trial, in low 
resource settings where biomass and household garbage burning are 
prevalent.

The open burning of municipal solid waste (MSW) –frequently observed in developing countries– emits harmful
pollutants, including ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC), and deteriorates the air quality in
urban areas. This work reports on PM2.5 and BC measurements (ﬁxed and mobile) conducted in a residential
neighborhood on the outskirts of a Brazilian city (Londrina), complemented by a public opinion survey to under-
stand the open burning in the context of waste management. Mean (± standard deviation) BC concentration
(1.48 ± 1.40 μg m−3) at the ﬁxed sites of the neighborhood was lower than downtown, while PM2.5 (9.68 ±
8.40 μg m−3) concentration was higher. The mobile monitoring showed higher mean PM2.5 concentrations but
lower BC/PM2.5 ratios than downtown, with sharp and fast spikes (up to 317.87 and 565.21 μg m−3 for BC and
PM2.5, respectively). The large spatial heterogeneity of particulate concentrations was associated with the occur-
rence of MSW burning events. Our observations were veriﬁed by the survey respondents who identiﬁed poor
waste management practices: garbage in streets, waste burning, and illegal dump sites. Even though the area
has a municipal waste collection service, the majority of the respondents (87%) had seen waste burning close
to their homes on a weekly basis, and think that people burn waste out of habit (54%) and because they are
not patient to wait for the collection services (67%). To combat this illegal practice, we suggest raising the public
awareness through campaigns at local level, adopting education initiatives and economic incentives for correct
waste segregation, and enforcing regular inspection of burning events by the authorities. Our research method
proved to be a time- and cost-effective approach for mapping particulate concentrations and for identifying un-
desirable waste practices, and could be effectively applied to other global cities.

1. Introduction
The world population generated 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid
waste (MSW) in 2016, and it is estimated to reach 3.40 billion tons by
2050 under a business-as-usual scenario (Kaza et al., 2018). Brazil is
the ﬁfth largest waste producer on the planet (Wiedinmyer et al.,
2014), with 62.8 million tons of MSW collected in 2018 (SNIS, 2019).
Out of this total, 74% was disposed of in sanitary landﬁlls, 11% was
discarded in controlled landﬁlls (with no leachate-control systems
and/or gas collection), 13% in dump sites and 2% was treated in facilities
for recycling materials (SNIS, 2019).
Even though the National Solid Waste Policy establishes sanitary
landﬁlls as safe disposal systems of non-recyclable waste since 2010
(Brazil, 2010), the law enforcement on illegal waste disposal has been
delayed by 54% of the Brazilian municipalities (ABRELPE, 2019) because
of ﬁnancial constraints and infrastructure deﬁcit. New deadlines for
suppressing illegal disposal in Brazilian cities have been recently ap-
proved, with gradual enforcement in the period 2021–2024, depending
on the city's population size (Brazil, 2020).
Dump sites can contaminate soil and water by leachate inﬁltration
and run-off, deteriorate vegetation, contribute to global warming and
to air pollution mainly through spontaneous ﬁre or deliberate burning
(ISWA, 2015; UN, 2019; Ferronato and Torretta, 2019). Open burning
is a common practice to reduce volume and odors of dumped or uncol-
lected waste, and can be observed at the municipal level (controlled
landﬁlls and dump sites) and at individual households in most develop-
ing countries (Estrellan and Iino, 2010; Lemieux et al., 2004). Reducing
these environmental impacts is well aligned with the agenda of the
United Nations through several Sustainable Development Goals (SDG
3, 11, 13 and14) (UN, 2019).
The open burning of MSW is a very inefﬁcient combustion process
due to its low temperature and limited oxygen supply. Moreover,
since no air pollution control equipment is used, a variety of chemical
species with different levels of toxicity is emitted into the atmosphere
(Estrellan and Iino, 2010). Because the waste is highly heterogeneous
and the burning conditions are uncontrolled, the number and share of
the emitted species can vary largely (Lemieux et al., 2004). Typically,
particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), greenhouse gases
(CO2,
N2O,
CH4),
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
(PAH),
polychlorinated dibenzodioxin and dibenzofuran (PCDD/F) are injected
in the atmosphere by the combustion of MSW (Estrellan and Iino, 2010;
Lavric et al., 2004; Lemieux et al., 2004; Gullett et al., 2001; Zhang et al.,
2017), which can cause harmful effects on human health. For example,
the premature adult mortality per year due to the chronic exposure to
ﬁne particles (PM2.5) from open waste combustion was estimated to
be 270,000 worldwide (Kodros et al., 2016).
Black carbon (BC) is a component of the PM2.5 resulting from the in-
complete combustion of carbon-containing materials. It is associated
with several deleterious effects on human health (e.g., Gan et al.,
2010; Sunyer et al., 2015; Bové et al., 2019) and is an important short-
lived climate pollutant because of its large global warming potential
(Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008). Within the municipal solid
waste sector, open burning in landﬁlls and dump sites represents a sub-
stantial source of BC, resulting in global emissions of 631 Gg BC per year
(Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). Thus, curbing BC and PM2.5 emissions and
improving solid waste management in developing countries may
bring signiﬁcant co-beneﬁts for health and the climate. Particularly,
non-governmental organizations encourage initiatives to monitor, con-
trol and adopt measures to decrease BC emissions from the open burn-
ing of MSW. For example, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC)
municipal solid waste initiative provides assistance to municipalities
to adopt integrated management systems to improve waste collection
and to decrease the occurrence of garbage on streets or illegal dump
sites, where open burning can occur (CCAC, 2020).
On a global scale, MSW consists mainly of organic waste (44%: food,
yard and green waste) and dry recyclables (38%: plastic, paper,
cardboard, metal, and glass), with the former accounting for up to 56%
in low-income countries (Kaza et al., 2018). Unfortunately, the charac-
terization of the open burning of MSW is less investigated, such as the
amount and type of waste, the burning area and frequency of this prac-
tice. Nevertheless, knowledge of the type and composition of the MSW
is vital to understand the impacts of uncontrolled waste burning on the
air quality, human health and climate change and to improve atmo-
spheric emission inventories (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019).
Because the open burning of MSW in developed countries is mini-
mal, due to their ﬁnancial capacity to manage waste and promote effec-
tive collection (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014), studies on the impact of this
practice on urban air quality focus mostly on developing countries. For
example, ambient concentration of several chemical species emitted
by waste burned in landﬁlls and households were measured in Indian
(e.g., Agarwal et al., 2020; Dumka et al., 2018; Tiwari et al., 2015), Chi-
nese (Liu et al., 2020), Lebanese (Baalbaki et al., 2016), and Nigerian
(Oguntoke et al., 2019) cities. Even though Brazil is the third largest
emitter of atmospheric pollutants by the open burning of MSW, just be-
hind China and India (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014), to the best of the au-
thors' knowledge, there are no studies on the environmental impact of
this frequent practice in Brazil.
This work reports on ﬁxed-site and mobile measurements of BC and
PM2.5 concentrations in a residential area in the city of Londrina (Brazil)
where the burning of MSW occurs frequently. It also presents the results
of a public opinion survey with students attending two schools located
in the study area in order to better understand waste burning (fre-
quency, materials burned, motive) in the context of waste management.
2. Methodology
2.1. Study area
Londrina is a city of 569,733 inhabitants (IBGE, 2020) located in the
northern part of the State of Paraná, southern Brazil (Fig. 1a). The cli-
mate of the region is temperate, wet throughout the year and with
hot summers (Cfa in the Köppen-Geiger classiﬁcation). The mean an-
nual temperature is 21.6 °C and the mean cumulative annual rainfall is
1583 mm (INMET, 2019). The main local sources of air pollution are
on-road trafﬁc, industrial emissions, and illegal burning of MSW
(Targino and Krecl, 2016; Charres, 2019). The region is also affected
by long-range transport of pollutants emitted by biomass burning in
other regions of Brazil and in neighboring countries, mainly from Au-
gust to October (Targino et al., 2019).
Londrina has 54 neighborhoods and the collection of MSW occurs
door-to-door for the residential sector, covering 100% of the urban
area. One company collects organic and non-recyclable waste (up to
600 l per week and household) and seven waste picking cooperatives
are in charge of collecting recyclable materials (CMTU, 2020). In 2017,
127,500 tons of organic and non-recyclable waste were collected in
the city, while the cooperatives commercialized a total of 8766 tons of
recyclable materials (CMTU, personal communication, 2020). The city
has two voluntary delivery sites that receive up to 1 m3 per household
and month of construction debris, wood pieces, tree clippings, and
large objects such as furniture. Disposal of organic, healthcare, industrial
waste, as well as plaster, batteries, lamps and tires is prohibited at these
locations. These delivery sites work Mon-Fri (08:00–16:45) and Sat
(08:00–11:45). A composting initiative implemented by the municipal-
ity has been in place since 2011, using the organic waste collected in
downtown neighborhoods separately from the non-recyclable waste.
Finally, residents can drop off certain hazardous and non-hazardous
waste (e.g., batteries, lamps, tires, e-waste) at speciﬁc sites (CMTU,
2020) for recovery or proper disposal, as part of the so-called “reverse
logistic” initiative (the return of products from the end consumer back
to the manufacturer).
The open burning of waste is illegal and subject to a ﬁne, whose con-
trol and execution are responsibilities of the Municipal Environmental

Secretariat (SEMA). Through a dedicated phone line, SEMA registered
565 anonymous complaints of illegal ﬁres across the city (Fig. 1b) in
the period 2013–2016. The burning of plastics, electronics, wood, tires,
construction debris, tree clippings and mowing residues were most
widely reported (SEMA, personal communication, 2017).
This study was conducted in a residential area in the east side of the
city, incorporating Interlagos, Fraternidade and Ideal neighborhoods
(Fig. 1c). We chose this area due to the large number of anonymous
ﬁre complaints (Fig. 1b), logistics (proximity to the sampling location
for instrumental maintenance and frequent data downloading), security
concerns (the equipment had to be left unattended at the ﬁxed sites),
and driving safely for mobile monitoring (routes 1, 2 and intercompar-
ison). These neighborhoods consist of sparsely built, detached houses,
gathering a population of 24,428 inhabitants with low-middle income
and a literacy rate of 95% (IBGE, 2010). We covered an area of
1.29 km2 (delimited by route 1, Fig. 1c) with the following land use:
vegetation (40.5%), roof (36.6%), asphalt (20.0%), bare soil (2.8%) and
water (0.1%). In these neighborhoods, organic and non-recyclable
waste was collected three times per week and recyclable materials
once per week. Even though dumping waste is unlawful, a dump site
was identiﬁed within the study area (Fig. 1c, DS), where frequent
open burning of MSW was reported by the local residents (SEMA, per-
sonal communication, 2017).
2.2. Field work
2.2.1. Fixed-site monitoring
Air quality instruments were deployed at two ﬁxed sites: at the cam-
pus of the Federal University of Technology (UTF) and at the Social As-
sistance Ofﬁce (CRAS) (Fig. 1c). BC and PM2.5 concentrations were
measured during 35 days (6 June through 11 July 2017) at CRAS site
with a microaethalometer (model AE51, AethLabs, USA) and a photom-
eter (DustTrak model 8520, TSI, USA), respectively. The instruments
were installed in an ofﬁce, with the sampling lines passing through a
window to sample outside air at 2 m from the ground. BC concentra-
tions were also monitored at the UTF campus with a seven-
wavelength aethalometer (model AE42, Magee Scientiﬁc, USA) oper-
ated with a 2.5 μm cyclone and the inlet located at a height of 2 m.
The details of the instrument setup are displayed in Table 1.
Weather conditions (air temperature, relative humidity, wind direc-
tion and speed, and precipitation) were obtained from the meteorolog-
ical station managed by the Paraná Meteorological System (SIMEPAR),
located 7 km southwest of the UTF campus. We manually counted the
motorized vehicles circulating in front of CRAS and UTF sites. Following

Targino et al. (2016), total volume per hour and per vehicle category
(passenger cars, motorcycles, trucks and buses) were counted twice
per day (08:00–09:00 and 17:00–18:00) on selected weekdays.
2.2.2. Mobile monitoring
The mobile samplings of BC and PM2.5 were conducted on two
routes, driven simultaneously with two passenger cars on eight selected
weekdays during the ﬁeld campaign (Fig. 1c). Each car contained a kit
with an AE51, a DustTrak 8520 and a GPS receptor (model D-100,
GlobalSat, Taiwan), operated under the conditions detailed in Table 1.
The two routes consist of roads with reduced motorized trafﬁc and no
public transport bus service. This strategy allowed us not only to avoid
sampling plumes emitted by vehicle exhausts, but also to drive slowly
(vehicle speed below 20 km h−1) and, thus, to increase the number of
sampling points per km driven. Route 1 was 7.8-km long and comprised
the outermost part of the neighborhoods, with a larger fraction of va-
cant lots, which may favor the occurrence of MSW dumping and burn-
ing. Route 2 covered the inner part of the study area with a total
length of 5.6 km, and included a larger number of houses than route 1.
Because waste burning in the study area occurred more frequently
in the late afternoons (Targino et al., 2016), mobile sampling started
at 16:15. Both cars left the UTF campus driving on the same avenue (in-
tercomparison route, Fig. 1c), and parked at the CRAS site for approx.
10 min to intercompare the instruments onboard the cars with those
installed at that place. Finally, each car started its route, taking on aver-
age 45 (route 1) and 55 min (route 2) to close the loop. The researchers
kept a logbook detailing departure and arrival times, presence of other
vehicles driving close to the car, stops at trafﬁc lights, smell of burned
material and occurrence of MSW burning.
2.2.3. Public opinion survey
The main objective of this survey was to characterize the waste
burning practice by assessing the students' perceptions of the frequency
of ﬁres, materials most commonly burned and reasons behind this prac-
tice. We also investigated the waste management practices at the resi-
dential level and the students' knowledge of the health and
environmental consequences of MSW burning.
The survey was conducted through questionnaires containing a mix-
ture of nine closed- and open-ended questions (Supplementary Mate-
rial, Section C). The questionnaires were administered to students
attending two schools located in the study area (Fig. 1c, School 1: Ana
Molina Garcia State School, and School 2: Professor Carlos Zewe Coim-
bra Municipal School), with ages ranging from 11 to 17 years old at
School 1 and from 6 to 10 years old at School 2. In Brazil, students
must attend public school in the neighborhood where they live, hence
we assume that their answers are representative of people living in
that area. At least 394 questionnaires were required for a statistically
representative sample, with a tolerable error of 5%, given a population
of 24,428 inhabitants (Agresti and Finlay, 2008).
The questionnaire was previously tested with a small group of chil-
dren for language comprehension and then approved by the teachers
of the target students. Finally, the survey was administered to all stu-
dents by the same researcher during three selected days in September
2017. The researcher explained the purpose of the work and the correct
way to complete the questionnaire, and all students who were in the
classroom that day participated.
2.3. Quality assurance and quality control procedures
We operated the instruments following the procedures recom-
mended by their manufacturers. Flow rate checks on the DustTrak and
AE51 were performed using a ﬂowmeter (model 4100, TSI, USA).
The DustTrak units were zeroed daily at the ﬁxed site and immedi-
ately before the mobile samplings and, if required, their impactors and
chambers were cleaned. AE51 ﬁlters were replaced every day. We
checked the instruments' batteries and memories and synchronized
their clocks using the same laptop connected to the internet to ensure
clock accuracy. These procedures were applied daily during weekdays
for the ﬁxed stations and before each mobile sampling.
The instruments were intercompared throughout the campaign to
establish any discrepancies in the measurements caused by extended
runtime and/or lack of calibration. Discrepancies in the concentrations
were compensated by taking one of the instruments as reference to har-
monize the datasets. The data were also inspected for inconsistencies
such as negative, constant, extreme, rapidly changed and other suspi-
cious data. In some occasions, the AE51 units installed at CRAS and on-
board the cars showed negative concentrations. This behavior occurs in
clean environments with concentrations below the AE51 limit of detec-
tion, and/or when the instrument operated at a high sampling rate, due
to instrumental noise (Hagler et al., 2011). For example, negative con-
centrations were observed at CRAS (2.1% of the dataset) in the early
hours when BC levels were low. Several correction algorithms (Opti-
mized Noise-Reduction Algorithm (ONA), Local Polynomial Regression
(LPR) and Centered Moving Average (CMA)) available on the manufac-
turer's site (https://aethlabs.com/) were applied to the AE51 data. How-
ever, the general outcome was unsatisfactory. The ONA algorithm
zeroed the low concentrations; the LPR and CMA algorithms reduced
the negative values (from 2.1% to 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively), but
largely decreased the highest peaks in the data series (for example,
from 111.0 μg m−3 to 82.0 μg m−3 and 66.1 μg m−3, respectively).
These artifacts smoothed out the time series and rendered unrealistic
features, which could lead to misinterpretation of the datasets. Thus,
we decided not to use any of these correction algorithms and opted to
discard the negative data from further analysis. A compensation for
the loading effect was applied to the BC data following Virkkula et al.
(2007), but the data were not corrected for scattering artifacts due to
the lack of concurrent measurements of the aerosol scattering
coefﬁcient.
The DustTrak 8520 provides mass measurements based on particle
scattering and is factory calibrated to the respirable fraction of standard
ISO 12103-1. This calibration usually overestimates the concentrations
in urban environments, since urban aerosols are less dense than the
one used in the calibration (Ramachandran, 2005). Thus, we adopted
a correction factor of 2.01 obtained in a previous experiment by collo-
cating the DustTrak 8520 with gravimetric measurements at UTF. This
correction factor is consistent with values (between 1.65 and 2.78) re-
ported in other urban studies (e.g. McNamara et al., 2011; Pitz et al.,
2003; Wallace et al., 2011). Because aerosol optical properties are af-
fected by water uptake in high humidity conditions, PM2.5 measure-
ments were corrected following the correction curve developed by
Laulainen (1993).
2.4. Data processing
Hourly mean concentrations and descriptive statistics were com-
puted for the ﬁxed-site measurements (arithmetic mean, median, min-
imum, maximum, 5th and 95th percentiles, and standard deviation SD).
Note that we reported BC concentrations at UTF only for the wavelength
coincident (880 nm) with the AE51 monitors.
Black carbon particles from biomass burning have stronger absorp-
tion in the UV region than fossil fuel, which absorbs mostly in the IR
(Kirchstetter et al., 2004), and this optical property allows to separate
the contributions from these emission sources. The absorption Ång-
ström exponent (Å) calculated at two separated wavelengths (UV and
IR) can be used as an indicator of the origin of BC. The Å value for pure
trafﬁc conditions is low and less variable whereas the exponent for
pure biomass burning has a higher and wider range, depending on the
biomass type and combustion process (Kirchstetter et al., 2004;
Sandradewi et al., 2008; Russell et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2018). In this
study, we calculated Å using the 370 and 880 nm wavelengths (Å370/
880). We adopted the following criteria for aerosol characterization:
i) Å370/880 values smaller than 1.1 indicate fossil fuel combustion

Science of the Total Environment 765 (2021) 142736
4
(Sandradewi et al., 2008), ii) larger than 1.5 are mostly due to biomass
burning (Liu et al., 2018), and iii) values in between (1.1–1.5) indicate
that BC-rich aerosol was emitted by a combination of fossil fuel and bio-
mass burning.
BC and PM2.5 mobile measurements were georeferenced by
matching their corresponding times with GPS times. The spatial distri-
bution of the pollutants was calculated by taking median values of ag-
gregated concentrations within 50–70 m buffers along the routes. The
buffer size was based on a trade-off between data availability and over-
lapping buffers. Because the negative effect of peak pollution concentra-
tions on human health is well documented (Dons et al., 2019; Jeong and
Park, 2018), we also explored the spatial distribution of the 95th per-
centile concentrations aggregated within the same buffers used for the
median calculations. Note that we only considered mobile data for
routes 1 and 2, excluding the intercomparison section of the route to
avoid inﬂuence from the exhaust plumes from the higher number of ve-
hicles circulating on the latter.
Survey data were processed per school, coding closed-ended an-
swers with a binary format (failure = 0, success = 1). In the case of
open-ended questions (part of questions 6 and 9), all contributions
from the respondents were grouped according to their similarity to
facilitate the interpretation of the results. The response rate was
also computed for each question. Finally, we calculated the mean
percentage of respondents per question, considering both school
together.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Fixed-site monitoring
During the sampling campaign, the mean daily air temperature and
relative humidity varied between 12.5 °C and 22.1 °C and between 57%
and 96%, respectively. The mean wind speed was 2.4 m s−1 and the pre-
dominant wind directions were east (35%) and southeast (21%). The ac-
cumulated rainfall over the study period was 82.2 mm and it rained on
ﬁve out of 36 days on weekdays mostly during the night, with the larg-
est daily rainfall of 33.6 mm on 06 June 2017. The mean daily solar radi-
ation dose was 11.7 MJ m−2, varying between 1.4 (on 13 June) and
14.4 MJ m−2 (on 11 June).
To illustrate the spatio-temporal variability of the pollutant concen-
trations, Fig. 2 displays hourly values between 24 and 30 June 2017 (Sat-
urday to Friday). Even though, the ﬁxed sites were only 1.7 km apart, BC
concentrations were higher at CRAS than at UTF (Fig. 2b,c), suggesting
the occurrence of localized pollution events near the former. For exam-
ple, a BC peak concentration of 13.7 μg m−3 was recorded at CRAS on 27
June at 10:00 whereas the value measured at UTF was 10-fold lower
(1.36 μg m−3), with wind conditions unfavoring the transport towards
UTF (northeasterly at 3.6 m s−1). The highest PM2.5 peaks at CRAS
were observed in the evening (28–30 June) and early hours (25–26
June), and did not coincide with the BC peaks, indicating that the contri-
bution of BC to the PM2.5 fraction largely varied with time (Fig. 2a,b).

Note that values of Å370/880 higher than 1.50, occurred in the evenings
(Fig. 2d), indicating predominance of biomass smoke (Liu et al., 2018).
Targino and Krecl (2016) also reported the increase of smoke and
peak BC concentrations in the same area in the evenings.
Descriptive statistics of hourly concentrations of BC, PM2.5 and
values of Å370/880 measured at the ﬁxed sites are displayed in Table 2,
considering the entire sampling campaign. Missing data corresponds
to periods when the instruments were not operating due to mainte-
nance, data download or electric power failure. BC concentrations
were higher and more variable at CRAS (mean ± SD: 1.48 ±
1.40 μg m−3) than at UTF (mean ± SD: 1.18 ± 0.76 μg m−3). The
Mann-Whitney U test at 5% signiﬁcance level (p-value < 0.05) indicated
that the BC concentrations at CRAS were signiﬁcantly higher than at
UTF. Because the CRAS site is located in a more densely populated
area, it most likely that the higher BC concentrations are linked to fre-
quent waste burning activities. PM2.5 concentrations at CRAS also
showed a large dispersion (mean ± SD: 9.68 ± 8.40 μg m−3). The ab-
sorption Ångström exponent varied between 0.68 and 2.03, with 30%
of the values smaller than 1.10 (interpreted as periods dominated by
fossil fuel combustion), and 4% of the values higher than 1.50. Around
66% of the time, BC-rich aerosols were due to a combination of emis-
sions from both fossil fuel and biomass burning.
Table 3 shows a comparison with other studies conducted at several
sites in Londrina. The mean BC concentrations at CRAS and UTF were
lower than within a busy street canyon (south and north façades,
being the latter close to a bus stop) and higher than at an urban back-
ground site (rooftop located downtown). Note that the street canyon
site has a larger trafﬁc volume at rush hours on weekdays (661 vehicles
h−1, 13% of which are heavy-duty diesel vehicles HDDV) (Krecl et al.,
2019) than at UTF (234 vehicles h−1
,
5% HHDV) and CRAS (45 vehicles
h−1, 2% HDDV). On the other hand, the mean PM2.5 concentration at
CRAS was higher than the values reported elsewhere, indicating a
large contribution of other local emission sources than motorized trafﬁc
at this site. Å370/880 values larger than 1.5 were observed at UTF (this
study) and at an urban background site (rooftop) (Krecl et al., 2016), in-
dicating inﬂuence of biomass burning events on the aerosol load over
the city. Krecl et al. (2016) reported high Å370/880 values between
23:00 and 04:00, which they attributed to the advection of pollutants
emitted by biomass burning in suburban areas. They explained that
the biomass plume was more easily identiﬁed downtown in this period
than during the day, when the large trafﬁc emissions masked the bio-
mass signal.
Table 4 shows results from other studies conducted in global cit-
ies where the authors declared a contribution from burning of MSW
to the particle load. The comparison is challenging because of the dif-
ferent characteristics of the sampling sites, sampling frequencies and
reported statistics. In relation to BC, Indian cities (Delhi and Hydera-
bad) presented much higher BC concentration than our study. Note
that both Indian studies were conducted in densely populated cities
(29.4 and 10.0 million in 2020, respectively), with a variety of emis-
sions sources and at sampling sites located downtown. These sites
were largely dominated by combustion of fossil fuel (motorized traf-
ﬁc, industries) and waste burning was mentioned as a smaller contri-
bution within the biomass combustion activities. The maximum
Å370/880 value at UTF site was higher than those reported by the
Indian studies, indicating that eventually aerosols were more domi-
nated by biomass burning in our case. For PM2.5, the Indian studies
again reported the highest concentrations in Chennai (population
of 11.0 million in 2020) and Delhi. The studies by Weichenthal
et al. (2015) and Baalbaki et al. (2016) showed that spikes in PM2.5
concentrations (a high value for a short time period) due to the
burning of MSW can be several times higher than the mean value.
This was particularly relevant in the small city of Iqaluit (7700 inhab-
itants, North Canada) when the winds transported pollutants
emitted by a spontaneous landﬁll burning at 2.4 km far from the
receptor site.
Finally, the diurnal cycles (mean, median, 5th and 95th percentiles)
of pollutant concentrations were plotted for weekdays, Saturday and
Sundays and displayed in Fig. 3. Overall, the pollutant concentrations
exhibited a different pattern compared to studies conducted in trafﬁc-
dominated environments. PM2.5 concentrations were higher at week-
ends than on weekdays, with largest values between 17:00 and 22:00
(Fig. 3a) whereas they peaked on weekday mornings (07:00) and eve-
nings (18:00) downtown (Krecl et al., 2019). BC concentrations were
higher on weekdays than at weekends at both sites, with CRAS showing
a larger variability with higher 95th percentiles in the afternoon (Fig. 3b,
c). According to the evolution of the Å370/880 values (Fig. 3d), the UTF
site was largely impacted by biomass burning (including waste burn-
ing) every day in the late afternoon and evenings, particularly on Satur-
days. These results match our visual observations of several ﬁre foci in
the neighborhood in the late afternoons which, allied to a more stable
atmosphere in the evening, favored the accumulation of pollutants
within the boundary layer.
3.2. Mobile monitoring
The average weather conditions during the mobile sampling were as
follows: air temperature of 21.5 °C, relative humidity of 60%, wind speed
of 3.0 m s−1, prevailing easterly winds (69%) and no rainfall.

As an example of mobile sampling, Fig. 4a illustrates the time series
of BC and PM2.5 concentrations (10-s) measured on route 1 on 22 June
2017, along with simultaneous measurements at CRAS (1-min). A 10-
min intercomparison period (shaded area) in front of the CRAS building
showed a very good agreement between instruments (Pearson's corre-
lation coefﬁcient of 0.91). Note that the particulate concentrations var-
ied little at CRAS for the entire sampling period (BC = 1.81 ±
0.89 μg m−3, PM2.5 = 8.95 ± 1.48 μg m−3), whereas several spikes oc-
curred in the mobile BC and PM2.5 data simultaneously, after the inter-
comparison
period.
Peak
values
varied
between
18.14
and
79.34 μg m−3 for BC and between 18.50 and 111.21 μg m−3 for PM2.5.
All spikes but one were associated with observations of waste burning
along the route, either in vacant lots between houses (Fig. 4b) or in
empty land (Fig. 4c). The high pollution episode registered at 17:07
was due to a smoky truck passing by, yielding a high BC/PM2.5 ratio
(0.75), typical of heavy-duty diesel vehicles with poor engine mainte-
nance (Lau et al., 2015). Note that the BC/PM2.5 ratios presented a
large range (0.05–0.98) for the waste burning spikes, most likely due
to both different materials being burned and combustion phases (ﬂam-
ing or smoldering) (Santoso et al., 2019 and references therein).
The statistical description of mobile BC and PM2.5 concentrations
(10-s) combining both routes, along with simultaneous measurements
at CRAS (1-min), is presented per sampling session in Fig. 5 and for all
days together in Table A1 (Suppl. Material). Overall, the mean particu-
late concentrations were higher (BC: 4.46 vs. 1.58 μg m−3, PM2.5:
13.06 vs. 8.93 μg m−3) and more variable (SD: 12.56 vs. 1.03 μg m−3
for BC, and 18.87 vs. 4.35 μg m−3 for PM2.5) for the mobile monitoring
than at CRAS. All mobile sampling sessions registered spikes (as illus-
trated by the high percentiles in Fig. 5a,c), while some transects pre-
sented even lower values than those registered at CRAS (Fig. 5a,c vs. b,
d). This rapidly varying behavior along with high concentrations is typ-
ical of localized emission sources close to the measurement point. After
carefully checking our logbooks, we found that these spikes were simul-
taneously observed with the burning of waste along the route in almost
all cases (90%), and just few cases corresponded to diesel trucks emis-
sions, as depicted in Fig. 4. Note that we were able to identify these
spikes given that the total trafﬁc was low in the study area, without
buses and a low number of trucks (2 ± 1 per route).
Our mobile BC concentrations showed small differences (mean: 4.46
vs. 5.10 μg m−3) when compared to mobile measurements conducted
downtown in March–April 2015 (Targino et al., 2016), but PM2.5 con-
centrations were higher in our study (mean: 13.06 vs. 8.43 μg m−3)
(Table A1, Suppl. Material). The higher PM2.5 concentrations but lower
BC/PM2.5 ratios in the neighborhood might be explained by the different
emission factors, fuel burned and combustion conditions for diesel en-
gines and open waste burning, considering that the main emission
sources are trafﬁc (downtown) and waste burning (on the city's
outskirts).
The spatial distribution of the aggregated median BC and PM2.5 con-
centrations for all sampling sessions is displayed in Fig. 6 (panels a and
b). The degree of spatial variability was assessed by the ratio of maxi-
mum to minimum median concentrations observed along the
50–70 m buffers of the monitored routes. This ratio was higher for BC
(91.3) than for PM2.5 concentrations (4.7). Thus, despite using the me-
dian values to represent the spatial distribution, the concentrations
and variability were still high for the particulate pollutants, especially
for BC. A large spatial heterogeneity of BC and PM2.5 is typically reported
in trafﬁc environments (e.g., Hankey and Marshall, 2015; Targino et al.,
2016; Krecl et al., 2020) due to a combination of various local factors
(trafﬁc volume, urban conﬁguration) and meteorology. For example,
Krecl et al. (2020) found ratios of 23.3 for BC and 7.4 for PM2.5 in an
area highly inﬂuenced by trafﬁc emissions in downtown Curitiba
(Brazil). This means that a neighborhood impacted by the smoke from
the burning of MSW can present an even larger heterogeneity for BC
than a trafﬁc-impacted environment.
To better understand the presence of spikes along the routes, we also
calculated 95th percentile concentrations aggregated in the same
buffers (Fig. 6, panels c and d). Pollution peaks were observed along
both routes, but the heterogeneity was higher for BC than for PM2.5
(ratio of 1139.5 vs. 58.7), similar to the median spatial distribution.
Route 1 presented sharper pollution spikes than route 2, in connection
with a higher number of vacant lots where waste burning was observed.
During every single sampling session, we observed waste and over-
grown grass burning in several vacant lots and in the front of seemingly
low-income houses on route 1 (Fig. B1, Supplementary Material).
Smoke plumes dispersed along that street and over other houses

located several meters away. Note that the CRAS site was less affected
by the particulate pollution during the mobile sampling (as shown in
Fig. 5), whereas the peak concentrations occurred close to School 2,
particularly on Groselha St. (route 1), where we observed smoke and

3.3. Public opinion survey
The number of students that completed the survey was 399 (School
1: 212; School 2: 187), with an excellent response rate for all questions
(lowest 99% for Question 7). For each question, a detailed summary of
the responses per school and shift is provided in the Supplementary Ma-
terial (Figs. C2–C10). Note that because students must attend public
school in the neighborhood where they live, we can assume that their
responses apply to our study area.
Considering all responses together, the students identiﬁed several en-
vironmental problems connected to waste management in their neigh-
borhood: people throwing garbage in streets (85%) and burning waste
(85%), and the presence of illegal dump sites (70%) (Question 1). In
Londrina, it is estimated that there are 300 points of illegal waste disposal
(CMTU, 2020) and the occurrence of waste burning was high during our
mobile monitoring, particularly on route 1 (Section 3.2).
The survey revealed that for 76% of the students, the population dis-
poses of their waste by using the door-to-door municipal collection ser-
vices. For 27% of the children, the ﬁnal destination of waste is burning
(Question 2). Sorting waste for collection is not a strong habit in the
study area, because 61% of the students believe that few people sort
their household waste, whereas only 6% believe that everyone practices
this activity (Question 3). A large fraction (87%) of respondents has al-
ready seen open waste burning close to their houses, and this occurs
very frequently (one to seven days per week) (Question 4), according
to 68% of the children (Question 5).
More than 60% of the students have seen plastics, paper, leaves/
branches, sofas and tires being burned in empty lots in their neighbor-
hood. Burning of wire cables and grass was identiﬁed by 50% and 44%
of the respondents, respectively. We frequently observed these illegal
practices close to our university campus (UTF) to recover copper by un-
authorized waste pickers and to clean lots with overgrown grass
(Figs. C11 and C12, Supplementary Material). The open-ended question
about other types of burned waste was answered by 100 students
(Question 6), who identiﬁed clothes/shoes (28%), old furniture (17%,
mainly matrasses and beds), and organic and non-recyclable waste
(9%) as the main waste groups. Other groups that were mentioned at
least by ﬁve respondents were in the following order: car wreckage,
wood pieces, rubber/styrofoam, electronic waste (TV, mobile phones)
and construction debris. Note that several items identiﬁed by the stu-
dents as burned material should have been collected by the municipal
service (organic and non-recyclable wastes), picked up by the coopera-
tives for recycling (plastics, paper) or discarded in the voluntary deliv-
ery points (furniture, wood pieces, green residues and construction
debris). Tires should have been disposed of through reverse logistics.
However, this operation has been proved unsuccessful in Brazil
(Milanez and Bürhs, 2009).
Almost all students believed that waste burning affects their heath
(95%) and the environment (96%) (Questions 7 and 8). The students an-
swered that the main motivation for burning waste are that people are
not patient to wait for the collection service (66%), burning waste is a
habit (54%), and people do not know that this activity is harmful to
their health (41%) (Question 9). Even though organic and non-
recyclable waste is collected three times per week, the warm climate
(which speeds up the organic decomposition, creates odor nuisance
and attracts insects), household layout (inappropriate space for waste
storage), and animals scavenging through the garbage might explain
why people want to dispose of their waste rapidly. In the case of recycla-
ble material, the collection occurs once per week resulting in a large vol-
ume of materials stored at home. Any failure in the service (change in
collection times and/or no service that week) might imply longer wait
for the ﬁnal disposal of the waste.
In the open-ended section of Question 9, 66 students added two other
important reasons for waste burning: people do not mind doing this (39%
of the respondents) and are too lazy to sort waste (32% of the respon-
dents). As previously commented, once waste accumulates at home,
some people might either dump it in vacant lots on top of pre-existing
ﬁre or burn it in their backyards. Other highlighted motives were prob-
lems with waste collection services such as the truck not collecting certain
items (most likely because they are not sorted, or they are not organic) or
residents not having time/resources to transport construction debris,
electronics and wood pieces to the voluntary delivery sites, or exceeding
the volume of 1 m3 per month and household. Some students also
pointed out that people start ﬁre as a form of vandalism.
3.4. Study strengths and limitations
The biggest strength of this study is the characterization of the air-
borne particulate matter (BC and PM2.5) in a residential neighborhood
frequently impacted by municipal solid waste burning. As far as we
know, this is the ﬁrst work in South America that particularly focuses
on this underestimated emission source, typical of urban areas in devel-
oping countries. Another strength is the choice of the pollutants: PM2.5
(a frequently used indicator of particulate exposure with well-
documented health effects) and BC (largely associated with incomplete
combustion and a potent short-lived climate pollutant).
This ﬁeld campaign, and particularly the mobile monitoring, oc-
curred over a limited number of sampling days in the winter season.
Thus, further measurements covering different seasons are needed for
capturing changes in emission patterns, and dispersion conditions
under other meteorological settings. Other chemical species, highly
toxic and typically emitted by MSW combustion, such as PAH and
PCDD/F, should be included in a future campaign. Mobile measurements
with microaethalometers operating at multiple wavelengths (including
UV) might be an asset to separate the biomass burning contribution
from trafﬁc emissions, regardless of the trafﬁc volume.
4. Summary and conclusions
We combined ﬁxed-site and mobile BC and PM2.5 measurements to
characterize the particulate pollution in a residential neighborhood im-
pacted by waste burning smoke. We supplemented the air pollution
data with a public opinion survey to understand the population's behav-
ior in relation to the disposal and burning of MSW in the study area.
On average, particulate pollution concentration at the residential
ﬁxed sites were lower than downtown for BC, but higher for PM2.5. Ac-
cording to the analysis of the absorption Ångström exponent, the resi-
dential area was impacted by a combination of trafﬁc and biomass
burning emissions during 66% of the sampling time, which might also
explain the increase in PM2.5 concentrations. Different from trafﬁc-
impacted environments, PM2.5 concentrations were highest in the late
afternoon/evening of weekends, when biomass burning dominated
the emission sources (Å370/880 > 1.50). While ﬁxed-site sampling was
conducted over a longer period, allowing us to identify the weekly pol-
lution pattern, mobile monitoring covered a larger area in a short-time
frame and much closer to the waste burning sites. By comparing our
mobile measurements with a similar study conducted downtown, we
concluded that: i) mean PM2.5 concentrations were higher in our
study but BC/PM2.5 ratios were lower, most likely due to differences in
emission factors, fuel burned and combustion conditions for open
waste burning (neighborhood) and diesel engines (more abundant
downtown), and ii) the larger spatial heterogeneity in the median and
95th percentile concentrations was linked to the occurrence of fast
and sharp spikes, associated mostly with the burning of MSW events,
according to our logbooks.
The public opinion survey showed that the respondents identiﬁed
poor waste management (people throwing garbage in streets, waste
burning, among others) as an environmental problem in their neighbor-
hood. Most respondents have seen these practices close to their home
very frequently. The most commonly burned materials were plastics,
paper, branches/leaves that could otherwise have been managed by
the city's collection service. The vast majority of respondents knows

10
that burning waste is harmful to their health and the environment, and
that the waste disposal habit of the population and lack of patience to
wait for the collection services would be the main reason for burning.
Thus, it can be concluded that the study area is signiﬁcantly impacted
by the burning of MSW, and that despite the regular waste collection
service, the population often opts for burning, either out of force of
habit or for their convenience.
Even though almost all students were aware of the deleterious effects
of waste burning on their health and the environment, 41% of them re-
ported that the residents who burn waste do not know the associated
health risks. Thus, we suggest raising awareness of the population
through public campaigns at local level. We also identiﬁed opportunities
for environmental education initiatives with residents in relation to waste
segregation, since sorting MSW at home is crucial to reduce cross-
contamination and maintain the quality of recycling materials. Moreover,
proper segregation reduces both the amount of waste at home and the
possibilities of burning as a ﬁnal method of disposal. Municipal programs
in suburban neighborhoods could be implemented on a regular basis
aiming to increase waste segregation through economic incentives, and
to also expand the composting initiative to other areas of the city. We
also emphasize that two voluntary delivery sites (green residues, furni-
ture, construction debris) and the few sites for reverse logistics are scarce
for the size of the population, and the allowed volume for waste disposal
should be revised. Other solutions should be implemented for residents
who either cannot afford or do not have time to transport their waste to
those points. Finally, regular inspection by the authorities is also essential
to eliminate/reduce this practice, and more budget and staff should be al-
located to this end to increase enforcement.
Brazil has legislation and a national strategy to develop a solid waste
management system, which all cities should adhere to. However, the im-
plementation and enforcement are often lacking. Even though this study
was carried out in a relatively small neighborhood compared to the di-
mensions of this continent-sized country, it paves the road for further
studies in other parts of Brazil (or South America) where MSW collection
systems are yet to be implemented or proven to be inefﬁcient, leading to
the open burning of household waste. Our combined methodology
(ﬁxed-site and mobile monitoring complemented by public opinion sur-
vey) proved to be a time- and cost-effective approach to map out ambient
air pollutant concentrations and identify undesirable waste practices. This
approach can be applied to other cities around the world where the open
burning of MSW is identiﬁed as an environmental problem.
Our pioneering work reveals that this topic is very relevant, given
the high particulate pollution levels in the areas near the ﬁre spots. In
closing, after searching for similar studies in other countries we identi-
ﬁed a large scientiﬁc gap in this underresearched ﬁeld. We focused on
the spatio-temporal characterization of two particulate pollutants (BC
and PM2.5), but other toxic substances should be targeted in further re-
search as well as the personal exposure of local residents.

Exposure to air pollution is a signiﬁcant health risk, and children who are exposed to it are likely to have lifelong
consequences. Ultraﬁne particles (UFPs) are emitted by all combustion sources, and can be used as a proxy for
the presence of combustion products. The present study, the ﬁrst of its kind to be conducted in Africa, assessed
schoolchildren’s exposure to UFPs, and apportioned their daily exposure to seven diﬀerent microenvironments
that they inhabited on a typical school day. The personal exposure of 61 pupils attending three junior high
schools was measured for 24 h each using wearable monitors over a period of 10 weeks. Two of the schools were
located in suburbs of Accra and the third in Berekuso, a nearby rural community. The results of our study
revealed the complex nature of children’s UFP exposure and its overall high to very high levels, signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the locality (suburb) of residence and the type of activities in which the children were engaged.

Pupils attending the schools in urban Accra received higher exposure than those attending the school in the rural
environment of Berekuso. The highest mean microenvironmental exposure was registered in the Home other
microenvironment in an urban school and in Bedroom in another urban school and the rural school. The high
exposure in Home other was due to pupils conducting trash burning and encountering environmental tobacco
smoke, and the high exposure in Bedroom microenvironment was due to the burning of mosquito coils at night to
prevent malaria. The principal sources that heightened exposure to UFPs were emissions from cooking (using
ﬁrewood and charcoal), vehicular traﬃc and combustion of biomass and trash. All pupils recorded the highest
exposure intensity in the Kitchen microenvironment.
1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2016b), 92% of
the world’s population live in places where air quality levels exceed
recommended limits. It is estimated that over 5.5 million premature
deaths per year globally, are caused by poor air quality (Landrigan
et al., 2018; Brauer et al., 2016). The economic cost of urban air pol-
lution is projected to amount to 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in
advanced countries, and 5% of GDP in low-income countries (Lanzi
et al., 2018). The health, environmental and economic consequences of
urban air pollution are more severe in low-income countries than in
advanced countries (Cohen et al., 2017; Petkova et al., 2013).
Personal
exposure,
a
critical
determinant
of
health
risk,
is
quantitatively expressed as the product of the concentration of a spe-
ciﬁc pollutant and the duration (time) of contact with the pollutant
(Morawska et al., 2013; Koehler and Peters, 2015; Lioy and Weisel,
2014). People are exposed to diﬀerent levels of pollutants in diﬀerent
urban microenvironments such as in homes, oﬃces, schools, recrea-
tional grounds and on roads during commutes. Quantifying and char-
acterizing people’s exposure to air pollutants with respect to time and
space in urban microenvironments signiﬁcantly aids health risk as-
sessment and policymaking (Koehler and Peters, 2015).
A number of methods are applied to quantify personal exposure to
air pollution (Koehler and Peters, 2015; Arku et al., 2015; Steinle et al.,
2013). These include the use of pollutant concentration data collected
from
airshed,

questionnaires to estimate respondents’ exposure, and the application
of wearable personal monitoring devices with or without GPS receivers
along with TAD to estimate subjects’ personal exposure (Ferrero et al.,
2017; Steinle et al., 2015). Quantifying personal exposure in urban
microenvironments is challenging, particularly in low-income countries
where few resources are allocated to air quality research.
Ghana is a low-income country in Africa with a high burden of
disease attributable to ambient particulate matter pollution (WHO,
2016a). Records of the Ministry of Transport in Ghana indicate that the
average age of a vehicle in Ghana is 14.2 years, meaning that many
vehicles in use in the capital city of Ghana (Accra), are old and there-
fore, less fuel-eﬃcient. The National Petroleum Authority of Ghana
reports that, as of July 2017, the sulfur content in diesel in Ghana was
3000 ppm, much higher than the allowed limit of 15 ppm in advanced
countries such as the USA. Some communities in Accra are known to be
characterized by poor environmental practices such as open burning of
trash (Rooney et al., 2012; Arku et al., 2015). Large numbers of old
vehicles, high sulfur content in diesel fuel, and anthropogenic activities
such as open burning of trash bring about increased particulate matter
pollution (Ristovski et al., 2006; HEI, 2010; Kelly and Fussell, 2012).
Ultraﬁne particles (UFPs, < 0.1 μm) have a higher number of par-
ticles per volume of air and higher deposition eﬃciency than larger
particles. UFPs are potentially more toxic than larger particles because
they have greater surface area and penetrate more deeply into the re-
spiratory tract (Goel et al., 2016; Oberdörster, 2004). Epidemiological
studies have linked exposure to UFPs to increased risk of neurodeve-
lopmental and cognitive disorders (Ohlwein et al., 2019). Despite their
potential high toxicity, UFPs in urban microenvironments are less stu-
died, particularly in African countries, as most of the studies have
tended to focus on particle mass concentration, and so literature re-
lating to studies on personal exposure to UFPs in African cities is non-
existent.
Relative to adults, children experience more severe health con-
sequences from exposure to UFPs because they are still developing, and
also inhale more air relative to the size of their lungs (Cliﬀord et al.,
2018; Heinzerling et al., 2016; Burtscher and Schüepp, 2012). Although
children’s exposure to UFPs occurs in diﬀerent microenvironments as
they go about their day, the school is a critical environment that con-
tributes to children’s daily exposure because they spend a considerable
amount of time there (Mazaheri et al., 2014; Mejía et al., 2011). As-
sessing children’s exposure to UFPs is challenging because of the unique
time-activity patterns children have, coupled with the high spatial
variability associated with UFPs. Studies on children’s exposure to UFPs
have mainly been conducted in high-income countries, most of which
focused on traﬃc-related sources (Buonanno et al., 2012; Mazaheri
et al., 2014; Mazaheri et al., 2016; Ferrero et al., 2017). No study has
investigated children’s exposure to UFPs in Africa (Branco et al., 2014).
It is important that children’s exposure to UFPs is monitored in order to
inform intervention strategies (Burtscher and Schüepp, 2012; Branco
et al., 2014).
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Ghana has a few
sparsely distributed monitoring stations in and around Accra. Because
air pollutant concentrations in urban microenvironments vary spatio-
temporally, the EPA’s data lacks the measurement density required for
it to be used in estimating personal exposure to air pollution of re-
sidents in Accra. The very few personal exposure studies conducted in
Accra, investigated exposure to particle mass concentration (Arku et al.,
2015; Zhou et al., 2011). To date, no study quantifying and char-
acterizing children’s exposure to UFPs has ever been conducted in
Ghana.
In view of the existing research gaps, this study aimed to char-
acterize and quantitatively assess the personal exposure to UFPs of a
sensitive population group – school children in and near Accra – with a
view to apportioning daily exposure to diﬀerent microenvironments
and identifying factors that drive personal exposure to UFPs in the
microenvironments.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
Personal exposure measurements were carried out on 61 school
children attending three junior high schools. The measurements were
conducted on weekdays over a period of 10 weeks between October and
December 2017. Prior to the start of the measurements, the schools
were visited, and presentations were made to the teachers, pupils and
parents to explain the aims and beneﬁts of the study, and to request
participation.

(approval no.: RAMSRI-ERC-PHD/002/16) and the Oﬃce of Research
Ethics and Integrity at the Queensland University of Technology (re-
ference no.: 1700000324), Brisbane, Australia.
2.2. Study locations and population
The three schools (S1, S2, and S3) were located in suburbs char-
acterized by diverse socioeconomic, demographic, land use, traﬃc, and
urbanization conditions. Two of the schools, S1 and S3, were located in
suburbs of Accra, and the third school, S2, was located in Berekuso, a
rural community near Accra. The locations of the schools are shown on
the map presented in Fig. 1.
• S1 is the Faith Baptist Community School Complex located near the
heavily traﬃcked Accra-Aburi highway in Madina, a commercial
hub and a suburb of Accra. Madina is a densely populated low-to-
middle-income community, with a lot of street vending and other
commercial activities. Charcoal and LPG are the cooking fuels used
in most homes in the community. S1 is a private school walled
around a compound of long single-storey, 3-storey and 4-storey
buildings. The schoolyard is partially paved with a rectangular
playing ﬁeld situated in the middle. School hours are 7:30 to 15:00.
The school runs a bus service that transports some pupils to and
from their homes on school days. GPS coordinates of the school site
are latitude 5.677853 (5° 40′ 40.27″ N) and longitude −0.173621
(0°10′ 25.04″ W).
• S2 is the Presbyterian Basic School located in Berekuso, a sparsely
populated rural community 23 km away from the central business
district of Accra, with a single untarred road passing through it.
Farming and petty trading are the major economic activities in the
community, where the economic status of the majority of the re-
sidents is low-income. Most homes in the community use ﬁrewood
and charcoal as cooking fuels. The school is a public one with two
parallel single-storey buildings on its compound. The schoolyard is
grassed and dotted with trees. School hours are 7:30 to 14:30. The
GPS coordinates of the school are latitude 5.753431 (5° 45′ 12.35″
N) and longitude −0.230933 (0° 13′ 51.36″ W).
• S3 is the Ashia Mills Basic School in the Ayalolo cluster of schools
located in the heart of the city of Accra, near the bustling urban
Agbogbloshie Market, and close to a scrapyard where e-waste (dis-
carded electronic devices) and car tires are recycled through open
burning by scrap-metal scavengers. Trading and commercial activ-
ities at the market take place on all weekdays and on Saturdays. The
community is characterized by slums, and the economic status of the
residents ranges from low to middle-income. Firewood, charcoal
and LPG are used as household cooking fuels. The school is a public
one, with a cluster of single-storey buildings on its compound. The
schoolyard is unpaved and is dotted with trees. School hours are
7:30 to 14:30. The GPS coordinates of the school are latitude
5.547005 (5° 32′ 49.22″ N) and longitude −0.217376 (0°13′ 2.55″
W).
Pupils aged 11–16 were recruited to participate in the study with

the help of their school teachers. School children in this age bracket
were recruited because: i) they could be instructed on the handling and
operation of the instrument used for the study; and ii) they could be
trusted with the proper handling of the instrument to generate reliable
data. The criteria for selection of a school child to participate in the
study was the willingness to take part in the study voluntarily and
competence in instrument handling. Written consents were obtained
from parents and children.
Most families in the study area prepare two meals on weekdays, in
the morning (between 05:00 and 07:00) and in the evening (between
17:00 and 20:00). Open burning of trash is a common practice in the
study area. Some level (3.8%) of tobacco smoking is reported among
the adult population in Ghana (Owusu-Dabo et al., 2009). Many
households in the low-income bracket, burn mosquito coils at night as a
means of keeping mosquitos out of their bedrooms. The conventional
mode of transport in and around Accra is by vehicular transport, which
is the reason for high vehicular traﬃc during rush hours. The city ex-
periences three rush-hour periods on weekdays. The morning rush hour
is from 6:00 to 9:30, when people leave home for work, the lunch-time
rush hour occurs in the afternoon between 12:30 to 14:00, and the
evening rush hour is from 16:30 to 20:30, when people leave work for
home. On some weekdays, especially Fridays, the lunch-time rush hour
extends over to the evening rush hour.
2.3. Instrumentation and quality assurance
Three Aerasense NanoTracers (NT Model PNT1000; Philips, The
Netherlands) were used to conduct the measurements. The NT is a
0.75 kg battery-operated hand-held device that measures particle
number concentrations (PNC) up to
×
−

cm
6
3 in the size range of
10–300 nm (Fig. A1). The device also measures mean particle diameter
in the size range of 20–120 nm. The NT has a 7-h battery life and a 7-h
charging time and operates in two modes: fast mode and advanced
mode. The fast mode has user adjustable sampling times down to 3 s,
but reports measurements only in PNC, while the advanced mode has a
16 s sampling time and reports measurements in both PNC and mean
particle diameter. In this study, the NTs were operated in the advanced
mode. The NT oﬀers advantages over many other instruments for per-
sonal exposure monitoring because it is portable, compact, wearable,
and can be used for continuous measurements. The ability of the NT to
measure both PNC and mean particle diameter oﬀers it a great utility.
For the purpose of data quality assurance, prior to their use in the
study, the NTs were tested in the International Laboratory for Air
Quality and Health (ILAQH), Queensland University of Technology
(ILAQH, QUT), in Brisbane, Australia, by benchmarking them with a
more advanced instrument, the condensation particle counter (CPC,
Model 3025A; TSI). An intercomparison was done in: i) a clean me-
chanically-ventilated laboratory at ILAQH; and ii) on the ﬁfth level
balcony of a 5-storey building characterized by urban ambient particles.
The NTs and the CPC were co-located and run continuously for 7 h in
each case. The mean PNC of the three NTs were

NTs readings correlated very well with each other (

Correction factor, deﬁned as ratio of mean PNC of CPC to mean PNC of
NT, was determined for each NT. These results were used to assess the

performance of the NTs against each other and to conﬁrm whether
readings from the NTs were similar. This approach was adopted be-
cause no standard reference PNC counter was available for use in Accra,
bearing in mind that UFP concentrations and size distribution in
Brisbane, a city in a developed country, are not the same as in Accra, a
city in a low-income country.
2.4. Data collection
Before commencing the measurements, each participant was trained
on how to handle and charge the NT and was requested to demonstrate
the process. The pupils who showed competence in the task were those
enrolled for the study. The internal clocks of the NTs were synchronized
to the local time in Accra.
The personal exposure of each participating pupil was measured for
24 h as they spent their time in diﬀerent microenvironments. The NT
was kept in their proximity while the participants were asleep at home,
washing down, charging it in the classroom, and playing in the school
playground. It was worn over the waist, with the sample inlet tube
attached to the breathing zone while the participants were commuting
to and from school. The participants were instructed to place the NTs on
charge overnight at home and while in the classroom during the day to
ensure the battery would not run out. They were also instructed to
record their activities during the sampling period, including time spent
in diﬀerent microenvironments such as in the classroom, bedroom,
living room, kitchen, on playground, and in daily commute, by in-
dicating the start and end times for each activity in the TAD provided to
them. The 24-h measurements of each participant commenced in the
afternoon and ended in the afternoon of the following day. Data from
the NT were downloaded after it was retrieved from participants. Each
week’s measurements were conducted for four days (starting from
Monday afternoon to Friday afternoon). A stepwise approach of com-
pleting measurements in one school before moving to the next school
was adopted. The measurement were conducted for ﬁve weeks in S1,
three weeks in S2 and two weeks in S3.
2.5. Data description and analysis
In all, 61 schoolchildren participated in the study. Each participant’s
data were checked for completeness and processed into a single time-
stamped dataset. The 24-h exposure proﬁles of all participants were
plotted and examined to identify missing data, times with high ex-
posure and possible reasons for the high exposure. Only 22 participants
had complete 24-h data. Although the pupils showed somewhat positive
attitudes towards participating in the study, their compliance with the
study protocol was poor, and their interest in science was lukewarm. As
a result, a number of them did not complete their TAD properly. 23
participants did not return their TAD because they were misplaced. Of
the 38 who returned their TADs, only 6 had entries for the 24-h period
of measurement, the rest of them had missing spaces in their TADs. To
ensure that the required information of all the participants was ade-
quately captured by the research team, the teachers were relied on to
provide time-location information on the participants during school
hours, to complement the information recorded in the TAD. Based on
this information, the microenvironments the participants inhabited
during the 24-h were determined and the duration spent in the mi-
croenvironments was estimated (Table 3). The mean UFP concentration
apportioned to each microenvironment was calculated, based on which,
the time-weighted exposure was also computed for the 22 participants
with complete 24-h data using Eq. (1). Each participant’s exposure in
the microenvironments was summed over 24-h to determine daily ex-
posure to UFPs.

3. Results
Out of the 61 schoolchildren who participated in the study, 33 were
in S1, 18 in S2, and 10 in S3. There were 34 boys (56%) and 27 girls
(44%). Of all the participants, 23 did not return their TADs because
they misplaced them. Of those who returned their TAD, 36 had missing
spaces in their TAD, which implied that they did not provide activities
to cover the entire 24-h period of measurement. Due to lack of access to
power and failure to put the NT on to charge as instructed, 40 parti-
cipants (64%) had some values missing in their continuous minute-by-
minute data. This included 19 pupils from S1, 13 from S2, and 7 from
S3. Table 1 presents a summary of the demographic characteristics of
the study population.
3.1. Activities in microenvironments
Based on the information provided by the teachers and that con-
tained in the TADs, a typical time-space-activities pattern was devel-
oped for all the participants including those who did not return their
TAD. The participants’ 24-h period was split into microenvironments,
activities, and average times spent in each microenvironment. It was
found that the participants spent their time in seven distinct micro-
environments, which we termed: Bedroom, Classroom, Commute, Home
other, Kitchen, Living room and School outdoor, undertaking diﬀerent
activities. Table 2 presents a summary of the seven microenvironments,
with typical activities undertaken and approximate times spent in each
microenvironment.
The participants spent a large fraction of their time at home
(average of 15.2–15.7 h, representing 63.3–65.4%). These numbers
refer to the average times spent by a participant. The average times
varied between participants and what is given is the range of values. At
home, the pupils were engaged in a variety of activities in the diﬀerent
home microenvironments. The participants spent approximately 2 h
(8.3% of their time) in the Kitchen microenvironment cooking and
eating, which generally occurred between 05:00 and 06:00 in the
morning and 18:00 and 19:00 in the evening. The participants typically
went to bed at 21:30 in the evening and woke up at 05:00 in the
morning, which means that on average, they spent 7.5 h (31.3% of their
time) in the Bedroom sleeping. Most participants spent approximately
2.5 h (10.4% of their time) in the Living room microenvironment
studying, relaxing, and watching TV. The rest of the participants’ time
at home was spent in the Home other microenvironment carrying out
household chores and engaging in social activities. Common household
chores of Ghanaian children include cleaning, sweeping, trash clearing
(which may include trash burning) and running errands. Their social
activities include attending evening prayer services and visiting ex-
tended family members.
Pupils in all the schools reported to school at 07:30 in the morning
and spent between 07:30 and 07:55 tidying-up the school grounds and
attending morning assembly (on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays),
or morning devotion (on Tuesdays and Thursdays). The ﬁrst lesson in
the morning commences at 08:00 on all weekdays in all the schools.
The ﬁrst (long) and the second (short) break are taken from 09:50 to
10:20 and 12:45 to 13:10 respectively in all the schools. S1 closes at
M. Nyarku, et al.
Environm
ent International 133 (2019) 105223
4
15:00, while S2 and S3 close at 14:30. When school closes, the pupils
take between 15 and 20 min to disperse from the school environment.
On a typical school day, pupils in S1 spent 7 h and 50 min (32.6% of
their time) at school, while those in S2 and S3 spent 7 h and 20 min
(30.5% of their time) at school. Pupils in S1 spent 6 h and 5 min
(25.35% of their time) in the classroom and those in S2 and S3 spent 5 h
and 35 min (22.9% of their time) in the classroom. All the pupils spent
1 h and 45 min (7.3% of their time) in the School outdoor micro-
environment.
Approximately 94% of the participants spent up to one hour, which
is 4.2% of their time, in the active commute from home to school and
back (Table 1). Most pupils left home for school between the hours
06:00 and 07:00 in the morning and returned home from school around
15:00 and 15:30 in the afternoon. The two major modes of transport
were walking and vehicle. The vehicle mode included private cars,
school buses and public buses (Table 1). Walking to and from school
was used by 48% in S1, 83% in S2, and 100% in S3. All pupils in S2 and
S3, and 75.2% in S1 spent 40 min or less commuting to and from school.
More pupils attending S2 and S3 lived close to their schools than those
in S1.
3.2. Concentrations and sizes of UFP
The time-series plots of mean hourly UFP concentrations measured
by the participants over 24 h are presented in Fig. 2. The ﬁtted LOESS
curve (mean of all the participants) shows two peaks occurring at 05:00
and 16:00. The increasing trend of UFP concentrations from 00:00 to
05:00 (midnight to early morning) could be attributed to: i) relatively
high UFP concentrations in some bedrooms; and ii) combustion emis-
sions from cookstoves in the kitchen during the preparation of morning
meals. Emissions from cooking activities accounted for the peak at
05:00 when the pupils were in the kitchen with cookstove ﬁres (ﬁre-
wood, charcoal and gas stoves) on to prepare the morning meal, which
is usually done between 05:00 and 06:00.
The increasing trend of UFP concentrations from 12:00 to 16:00
(afternoon to evening) could be explained by: i) traﬃc-related emis-
sions during the lunch-time rush hour (particularly at S1, which is close
to the heavily traﬃcked Accra–Aburi highway), and ii) combustion
activities such as open burning of trash that is undertaken by the pupils
while they are home. The peak at 16:00 occurred when the pupils were
home in the Home other microenvironment undertaking household
chores including burning of trash and encountering environmental to-
bacco smoke. In particular, trash burning is usually done in the after-
noon when the trash is dry and combustible. A somewhat increasing
trend of UFP levels is observed from 18:00 to 23:00 (evening to mid-
night).
The lowest concentrations were measured in school (i.e. between
08:00 and 12:00). The sharp spikes observed in the graph are as a result
of localized events such as the participant being close to a ﬁre source or
in the presence of environmental tobacco smoke. The mean UFP con-
centrations measured in the microenvironments are presented in Table
A1.
The sizes of the particles measured by the participants ranged

daily exposure.
The distribution of exposure received by the participants in the
seven microenvironments over 24-h grouped by schools is presented in
Fig. 4. The exposure received in the microenvironments varied widely
depending on the time spent in each microenvironment, conditions in
the school, and the type of activities in which the participants were
engaged. The exposure received by pupils in S1 had the widest spread,
while those received by pupils in S2 had the least spread.
The Bedroom microenvironment had the highest median exposure
for all the pupils (Table A1). The highest mean exposure was received in
the Home other microenvironment by pupils in S1 and in the Bedroom
microenvironment by those in S2 and S3 (Table A1). The second highest
mean exposure was received in the Bedroom microenvironment fol-
lowed by Kitchen, Classroom, Commute, Living room, and School outdoor
(lowest) for pupils attending S1. For pupils in S2, the second highest
mean exposure was registered in Home other followed by Kitchen, Living
room, Classroom, School outdoor and Commute (lowest). For pupils at-
tending S3, the second highest mean exposure was received in Home
other, followed by Classroom, Kitchen, Commute, Living room and School
outdoor (lowest).

The intensity of exposure in the diﬀerent microenvironments is
presented in Fig. 5. The ﬁgure shows that all the participants registered

Kitchen and Home other) was relatively higher than in school micro-
environments (Classroom and School outdoor). The exposure intensity
during Commute was considerably higher for pupils attending S1 and
S3, which are located in suburbs of Accra, particularly in the case of
pupils in S1, where the commute time is longer.
For pupils in S1, the mean exposure received in the Home other
microenvironment was higher than in the home indoor (Bedroom, Living
room and Kitchen) microenvironments, but for pupils attending S2 and
S3, household exposure was higher than exposure in the outdoor home.
The mean exposure received in the School outdoor microenvironment
was lower than in the Classroom microenvironment for pupils in all
three schools, because the pupils stayed in classrooms for longer than in
the School outdoor microenvironment. The mean exposure received in
the Commute microenvironment was the lowest for pupils in S2.
Overall, the pupils received higher exposure in home microenviron-
ments than in school microenvironments. Table A2 presents the mean
percentage contribution of the microenvironments to daily exposure.
The highest mean contribution to daily exposure was from the Bedroom
microenvironment, which accounted for 29% in S1 and S3, and 38% in
S2. The second highest mean contribution to daily exposure was from
Home other (20%, 14% and 10%), followed by Kitchen (14%, 12% and
9%) and Classroom (9%, 11% and 7%) for S1, S2 and S3 respectively.
3.4. Comparison with other studies
The results of this study could not be directly compared to other
studies that assessed personal exposure to UFPs in Ghanaian cities be-
cause no such studies have been reported. Therefore, we have
compared our results with similar studies conducted around the world
(Table A3). Fig. 6 is a graphical presentation of the comparison of
personal exposure in this study with ﬁve cities and a rural environment.
From Table A3 and Fig. 6, it can be seen that the mean (24-h)
concentrations in Berekuso were higher than in Cincinnati (USA) and in
Brisbane (Australia), but lower than all the other locations. By contrast,
the mean concentrations in Accra were higher than in all the places
except Jakarta (Indonesia).
4. Discussion and conclusions
The lack of reliable personal exposure data in low-income countries
presents one of the biggest challenges in the control of air pollution in
their cities. This study assessed daily personal UFP exposure of pupils
attending three schools in Accra and Berekuso. The personal exposure
was apportioned into seven microenvironments that the pupils en-
countered on a typical school day. We demonstrated that the main
driving forces of UFP exposure were lifestyle, sociocultural conditions
and the location (suburb) of residence. The daily personal UFP exposure
received by pupils attending the schools in Accra were relatively higher
and widely varied than in Berekuso. The reasons for this are that
Berekuso is a rural community and therefore UFP levels in many of the
microenvironments are relatively low, and to greater extent homo-
genous, as there is little vehicular traﬃc, and the participants there live
close to the school. For pupils living close to major traﬃc routes in
Madina and Agbogbloshie, which are located in Accra, traﬃc-related
emissions from the evening rush hour that occurs between 17:00 and
20:30; and cooking emissions during the preparation of evening meals,

usually around 18:00 are the main contributors to their exposure.
Directly participating in trash burning and possibly going near en-
vironmental tobacco smoke elevated the exposure received outdoor at
home, while emissions from cooking and burning of mosquito coils in
bedrooms at night resulted in household indoor exposure.
Mosquitos bites are the major vector of malaria transmission in
tropical countries including Ghana. Because malaria is a major health
challenge in Accra, various approaches are used to prevent mosquito
bites. Most households in the low-income bracket in the study area tend
to burn mosquito coils in bedrooms at night to repel mosquitos.
Mosquito coil burning is reported to generate signiﬁcant levels of par-
ticles (Wang et al., 2018), therefore the burning of mosquito coils at
night resulted in the generally high levels of UFPs in the bedrooms.
Poor ventilation also likely contributed to high UFP levels in the bed-
rooms. Ventilation in bedrooms is poor in certain communities due to
the way the houses were constructed. The houses are conﬁgured so that
the bedrooms, which mostly adjoin the kitchen, have only one or two
small-sized windows.
In addition to the reasons stated above, the fact that the pupils spent
a longer time (about 7.5 h) in the bedroom with relatively high UFP
concentrations also contributed to them receiving a greater portion of
their daily exposure in the bedroom. Accordingly, pupils attending S1
and S2 received their lowest exposure in the School outdoor micro-
environment because the concentrations of UFP in that microenviron-
ment were relatively low (Table A3) and the pupils spent just 1.7 h
(Table 1) in that microenvironment. Likewise, pupils in S2 received the
lowest exposure in the Commute microenvironment because their mean
UFP concentration for Commute was the second lowest with a short
average commuting time.
Given that there were no visible UFP sources in the classrooms and
in the schoolyards of the schools, it is clear that the UFP in both
classrooms and school outdoor microenvironments were from outside
the schools. The sources of UFPs in schools of Accra were diﬀerent from
those in the school of the rural community of Berekuso. The main
sources of UFP in S1 were vehicular traﬃc, burning of trash and
commercial activities, and those in S3 were vehicular traﬃc, burning of
e-waste and car tires, and trading activities. The main sources of UFP in
S2 were vehicular traﬃc and agricultural emissions. The variation in
the sizes of particles measured in the suburbs is proof of the diﬀerence
in the sources across the suburbs. Particles in fresher combustion
emissions are smaller in size. Such small particles were more commonly
observed in S1 and S3 than in S2 probably because more combustion
activities were present in Madina and Agbogbloshie than in Berekuso.
Aged and larger particles, which originate from numerous sources in-
cluding agriculture, were more commonly observed in the rural com-
munity of Berekuso.
Although the results of this study could not be directly compared to
studies conducted in Ghanaian cities because there are no such studies
that assessed personal exposure to UFPs, we exppected that the sources
contributing to UFP exposure, were similar to those contributing to
particle mass concentration exposure. Arku et al. (2008)) measured
PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in two
neighborhoods of Accra over a period of 3 weeks, and found that bio-
mass burning, traﬃc emissions, geologic materials, and marine non-
combustion particles were the principal sources of particulate matter
pollution in ambient Accra. Similarly, Rooney et al. (2012)) studied the
spatial and temporal patterns of particulate matter sources in four
communities of Accra, and found the use of ﬁrewood, charcoal, and
other biofuels for household cooking, ﬁsh smoking, trash burning, e-
waste burning and vehicle emissions as the major sources of particulate
matter pollution in Accra. Arku et al. (2015)) also investigated personal
exposure to PM2.5 of students in eight schools that were located in four
neighborhoods in Accra, and found the use of biomass fuels for cooking
in schools and households, the nature of schoolyard and playground
surfaces, and the location of the school relative to major roads to be the
main predictors of exposure to PM2.5.
Since personal exposure is the product of concentration present in
the microenvironments in which a participant resides and the time they

spend there, it is imperative that these two parameters are accurately
measured. One of the main sources of uncertainty in personal UFP ex-
posure assessment in this study was the low quality of information
provided by the participants on their activities. The participants pro-
vided the TAD information that could not be fully relied on to de-
termine how long they stayed in each microenvironment, although the
teachers were responsible for providing other critical information in-
cluding school hours and activities during school hours. It is important
to point out that GPS-enabled wearable monitors, which allow the in-
tegration of information on participants’ movements as a source of
secondary data to pollutant concentrations, could have been used to
reduce the challenge of inaccurate/incomplete TADs that was faced in
this study. However, due to logistics constraints, we could not use geo-
location tracking monitors (Steinle et al., 2013).
In general, personal exposure in Accra was among the highest re-
ported in the world. Therefore, the outcomes of this study has high-
lighted the need to intensify air pollution control in Accra. There is also
the need to raise awareness about air pollution and emphasize the
importance of avoiding activities that heighten UFP exposure in the
communities. We recommend the establishment of a special govern-
ment agency that will be responsible for safeguarding children’s re-
spiratory health in Ghana, considering that children are vulnerable
segment of the population.

The burden of disease associated with environmental exposures disproportionately impacts residents of low- and 
middle-income countries. Children living in rural regions of these countries may experience higher exposure to 
insecticides from indoor residual spraying used for malaria control and household air pollution. This study 
evaluated environmental exposures of children living in a rural region of South Africa. Quantifying exposure 
levels and identifying characteristics that are associated with exposure in this geographic region has been 
challenging due to limitations with available monitoring techniques. Wearable passive samplers have recently 
been shown to be a convenient and reliable tool for assessing personal exposures. In this study, a passive sampler 
wristband, known as Fresh Air wristband, was worn by 49 children (five-years of age) residing in the Limpopo 
province of South Africa. The study leveraged ongoing research within the Venda Health Examination of 
Mothers, Babies, and their Environment (VHEMBE) birth cohort. A wide range of chemicals (35 in total) were 
detected using the wristbands, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides, 
phthalates, and organophosphate esters (OPEs) flame retardants. Higher concentrations of PAHs were observed 
among children from households that fell below the food poverty threshold, did not have access to electric 
cookstoves/burners, or reported longer times of cooking or burning materials during the sampling period. 
Concentrations of p,p′-DDD and p,p′-DDT were also found to be elevated for children from households falling 
below the food poverty threshold as well as for children whose households were sprayed for malaria control 
within the previous 1.5 years. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using passive sampler wristbands as a 
non-invasive method for personal exposure assessment of children in rural regions of South Africa to complex

1. Introduction 
Air pollution is ubiquitous, but the burden of disease resulting from 
toxic exposures disproportionately affects residents of low- and middle- 
income countries (LMICs) (WHO 2018). Over 600,000 estimated deaths 
each year result from exposure to air pollution in Africa alone (ACGIH 
2018). Children are particularly susceptible to exposure because of their 
developing airways, immature immune system, as well as higher 
respiratory rates, food intake per body weight, and skin-to-volume ratios 
relative to adults (Kim et al., 2018; Masekela and Vanker 2020; Sly and 
Bush 2015; Voynow and Auten 2015). In rural South Africa, exposures 
from household air pollution and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are of 
major concern. The main source of exposure to household air pollution 
originates from burning solid fuels for cooking (Shezi and Wright 2018). 
While the transition to cleaner cooking technologies has progressed 
globally, many regions in Africa, and in other LMICs, still use polluting

fuels and technologies (Gordon et al., 2014; World Health, 2018). Over 
80% of the African region primarily rely on these polluting energy 
sources for everyday household activities like cooking, heating, and 
lighting (WHO 2018). Childhood exposure to household air pollution 
can lead to both acute and chronic respiratory conditions ranging from 
increased frequency in cough, wheezing, and acute respiratory tract 
infections to long-term ailments like chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (Fullerton et al., 2008; Masekela and Vanker 2020). Those living 
in rural regions of Africa can be exposed to insecticides, such as p,p’- 
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDT), from IRS conducted for 
malaria control. These chemicals are generally applied to the interior 
walls and rafters of traditional mud dwellings, and underneath the eaves 
on the outside of the homes (Bouwman et al., 2006; Gitari et al., 2018). 
p,p′-DDT exposure is of particular concern for early childhood devel­
opment because of its potential for neurotoxicity and endocrine 
disruption (Slima et al., 2017; Eskenazi et al., 2018; Liu and Schelar 
2012; Oulhote and Bouchard 2013; Patisaul and Adewale 2009; Viel 
et al., 2017). 
Assessing children’s exposure to environmental chemicals can be 
challenging as few non-invasive methods that can be easily deployed on 
a large scale exist. The use of wearable passive samplers has grown in 
popularity in the past decade and has shown to be an efficient approach 
for evaluating personal exposures (Gibson et al., 2019; Hammel et al., 
2016; Koelmel et al., 2021; Koelmel et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2020; 
O’Connell et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). These emerging tools are an 
extension of stationary passive samplers that have been used for the last 
two decades to collect airborne contaminants with polyurethane foam 
(PUF) (Gibson et al., 2019; Hammel et al., 2016; D Kim et al., 2018; 
O’Connell et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019), styrene divinylbenzene co- 
polymer (XAD) (Wania et al., 2003; Wania and Shunthirasingham 
2020), and polyethylene (Messier et al., 2019). Sampling devices that 
can be worn allow for the evaluation of exposure from both outdoor and 
indoor spaces as well as of the variability specific to individuals. 
Over 40 environmental health studies have evaluated personal ex­
posures using wearable passive samplers with most worn as a wristband 
(Okeme et al., 2022). Two wristband designs have been reported, 
including a commercial band and the Fresh Air wristband. The former is 
a loop of silicone rubber that is retailed by vendors as a ‘Livestrong’ or 
awareness bracelet. The silicone is a sorbent for environmental con­
taminants that are taken up from the air and the skin of the participant 
capturing a combination of inhalation and dermal exposure pathways. 
The Fresh Air wristband similarly uses a silicone rubber (poly­
dimethylsiloxane, PDMS) as a sorbent to collect environmental con­
taminants. The sorbent in the Fresh Air wristband, however, is encased 
in a perforated chamber mounted in a band to restrict assessment to 
inhalation exposures. The lightweight, non-invasive features of wrist­
band passive samplers enhance the feasibility of investigating the ex­
posures of vulnerable populations, like pregnant women (Gibson et al., 
2019), the older adults (Koelmel et al., 2021), and children (Koelmel 
et al., 2022; Levasseur et al., 2021; Quintana et al., 2019) compared to 
active sampling counterparts (Doherty et al., 2021). 
Numerous studies in the US have used these wearable tools to 
characterise personal exposures of organophosphate ester flame re­
tardants (OPFRs) (Hammel et al., 2016; Reddam et al., 2020), polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (Dixon et al., 2018; Hendryx et al., 2020; 
Paulik et al., 2018; Rohlman et al., 2019a; Rohlman et al., 2019b), 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (Hammel et al., 2018), pesti­
cides (Aerts et al., 2018), and a variety of pollutants (Anderson et al., 
2017; Bergmann et al., 2018; Craig et al., 2019; Donald et al., 2019; 
Nicole, 2018; Romanak et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Shaorui Wang 
et al., 2020; Zuy et al., 2020). Other studies in the US have examined 
children’s exposures to PBDEs (Kile et al., 2016; Lipscomb et al., 2017), 
OPFRs (Gibson et al., 2019; Hammel et al., 2020; Kile et al., 2016; 
Lipscomb et al., 2017), phthalates (Hammel et al., 2020), PAHs (Lin 
et al., 2020), pesticides (Harley et al., 2019; Vidi et al., 2017), and 
nicotine (Quintana et al., 2019). Most recently, wearable passive air 
samplers have been used to evaluate personal exposure to airborne 
particles, including respiratory virus (Angel et al., 2022). There have 
also been studies using wristbands conducted on adults outside of the US 
including West Africa (Donald et al., 2016), Peru (Bergmann et al., 
2017), Chile (Manzano et al., 2019), Bangladesh (Wang et al., 2020), 
Japan (Reche et al., 2020), China (Guo et al., 2021; Koelmel et al., 
2021), a combination of participants from France and Italy (S. Wang 
et al., 2020), and a combination of participants from South Africa, Peru, 
and the US (Dixon et al., 2019). There has been limited study of personal 
pollutant exposures for children outside of the US, particularly in LMICs. 
A recent publication assessed the exposure of 38 children (median age of 
12 years) and a guardian from the same household that lived in agri­
cultural communities in the southwest region of South Africa (Fuhri­
mann et al., 2022). Of the 21 pesticides evaluated using silicone 
wristbands, 16 were detected, including deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos, 
boscalid, and cypermethrin. Children were found to have elevated 
exposure levels to deltamethrin, cypermethrin, p,p′-DDE, and p,p′-DDT 
compared to their guardians. Beyond pesticides, further investigation is 
needed evaluating the mixture of environmental chemicals to which 
children are exposed in LMICs from other emission sources. 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the 
novel Fresh Air wristband to assess exposures to diverse range of pol­
lutants derived from various sources, including IRS and combustion 
activities among five-year-old children residing in the Limpopo province 
of South Africa. The relationship between detected exposures were 
further investigated to better understand the context in which exposure 
arises to inform future exposure mitigation interventions. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Study population and study design 
Participants in the current study were recruited from a larger 
ongoing birth cohort study, the Venda Health Examination of Mothers, 
Babies and their Environment (VHEMBE). Participants in the VHEMBE 
study included 752 mother-child pairs who were recruited between 
2012 and 2013 when women presented to give birth at Tshilidzini 
hospital in Limpopo’s Vhembe district. Eligibility criteria included: 
being at least 18 years of age, living in a home that was <20 km from the 
hospital, in which Tshivenda was the primary language, planning to 
remain in the study area for at least two years, having contractions more 
than five minutes apart at the time of recruitment and not having been 
infected with malaria during pregnancy (Coker et al., 2018). VHEMBE 
participants have taken part in follow-up assessments at multiple time 
points, including home-walkthrough visits and comprehensive surveys 
at one-week post-partum (Rauch et al., 2018) as well as at 1, 2, 3.5, and 
5 years of age (Di Lenardo et al., 2020). Given the size of the cohort, 
recruitment and visits were scheduled over the course of 18 months. At 
delivery as well as at each follow-up visit, bilingual (English and Tshi­
venda) staff members conducted a questionnaire-based interview in 
Tshivenda to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics, health, 
and exposure determinants. 
Among the 639 children who completed an assessment at 5 years of 
age, 57 children with a scheduled follow-up visit between September 
2018 and January 2019 were recruited and enrolled in the current study 
(Table S1). Children were given a Fresh Air wristband to wear for three 
days and were requested to keep the wristband on for all of their daily 
activities, except while swimming or bathing. At the end of the exposure 
assessment period, the wristbands were collected for chemical analysis. 
Four (7%) of the 57 deployed wristbands were lost by participants. Of 
the 53 retrieved wristbands, some evidence of tampering or damage was 
found for 35 units (61%). Two of these wristbands (3.5%) were excluded 
from analysis because of significant damage and two additional units 
(3.5%) were not analyzed due to technical challenges at the data 
collection phase. In total, 49 (86%) of the wristbands deployed were 
used in the present study.

At the end of the exposure assessment period, trained staff admin­
istered a questionnaire (Five-year Air Sampling questionnaire) to care­
takers to collect detailed information specific to the period during which 
Fresh Air wristbands were worn by the children. Information was 
collected about the start and end times of each burning episode (whether 
for cooking or other purposes), which fuels were used, whether fires 
occurred indoors or outdoors, and whether the child was present. 
Cooking and burning time durations reported for the entire sampling 
period were categorised into long (>8 h), medium (4–8 h), short (0–4 h), 
and none (0 h). Other information was also recorded by the question­
naire such as the road and traffic conditions near their home, proximity 
to large factories/warehouses or other major sources of pollution and 
whether a secondary cooking area was used. 
Information from two additional questionnaires was extracted and 
used in the analysis for this study: the Five-Year Follow-up Visit and the 
One-Week Postpartum Housing Survey. Information collected from the 
Five Year Follow-up Visit questionnaire used in this study includes ques­
tions about households characteristics, such as which fuels were used for 
cooking, heating, and lighting, poverty status, how smoke or steam may 
escape from the home, when the home was lasted sprayed for malaria 
control, and if children lived in the same home as was evaluated in the 
One-Week Postpartum Housing Survey. The Five-Year Follow-up Visit 
complemented the information collected in the Five-Year Air Sampling 
questionnaire by providing additional information about each partici­
pant’s household within the 18 months prior to when the Fresh Air 
wristbands were deployed. The One-Week Postpartum Housing Survey was 
conducted throughout 2012–2013 following initial enrollment in the 
VHEMBE study and birth of the child. Information collected during this 
examination allowed for the assessment of possible longitudinal expo­
sures resulting from household sources. The most pertinent information 
collected and used from this survey asked about the main sources of 
energy used for cooking indoors and whether the home was equipped 
with an electric stove or burner. Information from this survey was used 
only for participants who lived in the same home at the time of the Five- 
Year Follow-up Visit as they did at the One-Week Postpartum Housing 
Survey. Lists of the questions extracted from each of the three ques­
tionnaires are included in the SI (Table S2). 
Informed consent was obtained from all caregivers prior to partici­
pation in the study. This study was approved by the ethics committees of 
McGill University, the University of Pretoria, the Limpopo Department 
of Health and Social Development, Tshilidzini Hospital and Yale 
University. 
2.2. Reagents 
Methanol and hexane (Optima LC/MS grade), water and toluene 
(HPLC 
grade), 
dichloromethane 
(HPLC 
grade), 
and 
poly­
dimethylsiloxane were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH, 
US). Analytical standards were greater than 98% purity, they were 
purchased from Accustandard (New Haven, CT, US) and SPEX (Metu­
chen, NJ, US). 
2.3. Air sampling 
2.3.1. Passive air samplers 
Personal chemical exposures were evaluated using the Fresh Air 
wristband (Lin et al., 2020). PDMS sorbent bars were used to passively 
collect airborne contaminants. Four replicate bars were housed in a 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) chamber that was mounted in a wrist­
band. Participants in this study wore one wristband for three days. 
Following the exposure assessment period, all PDMS sorbent bars con­
tained in participants’ wristbands were cold chain shipped to the Yale 
School of Public Health for chemical analysis. 
The sampling behaviour of the Fresh Air wristband has been previ­
ously described (Lin et al., 2020). Briefly, field calibrations were used to 
determine the uptake rate and capacity of this wearable passive sampler. 
Semi-volatile organic compounds reported in the current study were 
found to reach equilibrium after five to 14 days of sampling. Children 
enrolled in the VHEMBE cohort wore the Fresh Air wristbands for three 
days to limit sampling of airborne contaminants to the linear uptake 
regime. 
2.3.2. Sample preparation and storage 
All laboratory glassware and tools were rinsed with methanol and 
baked at 75 ◦C for at least 24 h before use. PDMS sorbent bars (length =
10 mm, thickness = 0.8 mm, inner diameter = 2 mm) were custom 
fabricated using high-purity polydimethylsiloxane polymer (Dow 
Corning) and then cleaned in a vacuum oven (2 h at 260 ◦C) under of 
0.1–0.3 L/min flow of high purity nitrogen (99.99%) prior to use. 
Cleaned PDMS sorbent bars were individually placed in microvial inserts 
and stored in air-tight 2 mL amber glass vials with PTFE septa caps. 
Immediately prior to deployment, a field staff of the study team posi­
tioned four cleaned PDMS sorbent bars into the PTFE chambers and 
mounted these chambers into a wristband. PDMS sorbent bars addi­
tionally were secured in place using pre-cleaned neodymium magnets. 
Due to sometimes long travel distances, field staff stored the Fresh Air 
wristbands in pre-baked glass jars and carried them to the participants’ 
houses for deployment. 
The wristband was worn by participants for 2.9 days (SD = 1.0, 
range: 2 to 5 days) on average. At the end of the exposure assessment 
period, a field staff collected and stored the Fresh Air wristband in an air- 
tight container, then transferred it to the local research lab. Immediately 
after arrival, the field staff removed the PDMS sorbent bars from each 
sampler and placed them back to the amber glass vials using stainless 
steel forceps. Samples were stored at 5 ◦C prior to analysis. Field blanks 
were collected throughout the study were used to correct for potential 
contaminations. These PDMS sorbent bars (field blanks) went through 
all processing steps that samplers went through, including placement in 
and out of the form factors (sample preparation), storage, and sample 
introduction, without being placed on participants. 
2.3.3. Sample analysis and data processing 
All laboratory glassware and tools were rinsed with methanol and 
baked at 75 ◦C for at least 24 h before use. All cleaned glassware and 
tools were stored at 75 ◦C in the oven until use. Immediately prior to 
analysis, PDMS sorbent bars were individually rinsed to removed excess 
particle/dust collected on samples. As part of this rinse procedure, PDMS 
sorbent bars were transferred to pre-cleaned 2 mL amber vials using 
stainless-steel tweezers. Optima LC/MS grade water added to each 
amber vial and shaken for 10 min at 300 RPM. PDMS sorbent bars were 
dried using in-house nitrogen for 3 s and were then loaded with an in­
ternal standard mixture which contained 5′-fluoro-2,3′,4,4′,5-pentab­
romodiphenyl 
ether, 
naphthalene-d8, 
acenaphthene-d10, 
phenanthrene-d10, fluoranthene-d10, pyrene-d10, perylene-d12, and 
3,3′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether. PDMS sorbent bars were placed into 
pre-cleaned glass autosampler tubes (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD, USA) on a 
temperature-controlled autosampler tray maintained at 10 ◦C (M´eCour, 
Groveland, MA, USA). For sample analysis, an autosampler tube was 
transferred into a thermal desorption unit (TDU; Gerstel, Linthicum, 
MD, USA). The TDU was initially held at 30 ◦C for 1.1 min and then 
ramped at 720 ◦C per minute to 280 ◦C (5 min hold) under a flow rate of 
350 mL/min of helium gas (99.999%). Extracted analytes were cyro- 
focused to −90 ◦C on a 2 mm, glass wool deactivated liner in a cooled 
injection system (Gerstel, Linthicum, MD, USA) cooled to −90 ◦C. The 
transfer line between the TDU and cooled liner was maintained at 
250 ◦C. Analyses were directly transferred to the gas chromatography 
(GC) column (TG-5SILMS, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The carrier gas 
flow (helium) was set to 1.4 mL/min and the GC oven was held at 70 ◦C 
for one minute and then ramped at 7 ◦C/min to 300 ◦C. The final tem­
perature was held for 4.0 min for a total run-time of 37.86 min. During 
the analysis, full-scan electron ionization (EI) mass spectra (m/z 53.4 – 
800) was recorded at an acquisition rate of 4 Hz, and at 60,000

resolution on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, 
Waltham, MA, USA). Quality control samples and blanks (laboratory 
and transport) which were run every five samples. 
Raw mass spectral data were analysed using TraceFinder 4.1 
(Thermo). Blank feature filtering was conducted using field blanks to 
remove compounds with high of background contamination following 
previously described methods (Guo et al., 2021). Briefly, the 95th 
percentile of individual compound in samples that was less than 10 
times of the average of field blanks were removed. Batch-wise median 
normalization was used to account for potential batch effects (Koelmel 
et al., 2021). Exposures were quantified for 70 compounds using a 
seven-point calibration curve (Patterson and Sears 2017). Concentra­
tions below the limit of detection (LOD) were replaced by half the LOD 
(Xia and Wishart 2011). Wristband mass loadings were log2 transformed 
(in pg detected for each PDMS bar) and further normalised by the 
number of days each participant wore the wristband. Exposure levels 
were converted to a volume basis (pg/m3) using a generic uptake co­
efficient (0.43 m3/day) determined for the Fresh Air wristband. 
Quality assurance and quality control details of the described 
methods have been previously described (Lin et al., 2020; Guo et al., 
2021). Briefly, the thermal desorption extraction procedure used in the 
current study achieved 80 to 90% recovery of volatile and semi-volatile 
organic compounds, respectively, from the PDMS sorbent bars. 
Repeatability of measurements was evaluated for individual compounds 
at low, mid, and high levels. The standard deviation across three repli­
cates was less than 15% at all test levels for most compounds. Quality 
control samples analysed in each batch varied by 14% on average for all 
compounds.

3.1. Characteristics of study population 
3.1.1. Participant Characteristics 
Participant and household characteristics throughout the three-day 
sampling period are summarised in Table 1. Additional information 
about the study population is shown in Table S3. A total of 49 partici­
pants aged five-years were included in this study, with 55.1% (n = 27) 
being female. Over 75% (n = 37) of the participants’ households were 
below the upper bound poverty threshold based on household income 
(1183 Rand per capita per month; equivalent to about $65 US), 32 of 
these 37 participants were below the lower bound poverty threshold 
(785 Rand per capita per month; equivalent to about $44 US), and 24 of 
these, nearly half (49%) of the study population, fell below the food 
poverty threshold (547 Rand per capita per month; equivalent to about 
$30 US). 
3.1.2. Household characteristics 
The primary area for cooking in participants’ homes was an indoor 
kitchen space (77.6%) with 40.2% (n = 16) of these households 
reporting having a secondary cooking location either indoors (n = 7) or 
outdoors (n = 9). Out of all the fires that occurred throughout the 
sampling period, wood was the fuel most burned, making 70.5% of the 
total types of fuels reported being used, followed by paper, at 14.0%. 
Over three-quarters of the participants’ caregivers reported fuels 
being burned during the sampling period. Time spent cooking/burning 
during the exposure assessment period ranged from 0 (n = 11) to 19 h 
per day with the daily average of time spent cooking/burning materials 
being 119 (SD = 114) minutes. While information was not collected 
about the cooking appliance used in participants’ homes at the Five-Year

Follow-up Visit, 55.1% of children had not moved since birth when a 
One-Week Postpartum Housing survey was conducted. From this orig­
inal survey, 53.1% of participants’ households used an electric stove or 
burner for cooking; others used either wood cookstoves or paraffin 
cookstoves (38.8%). Nearly 90% of the homes burned waste on their 
property and about one-quarter (n = 12) of the participants’ homes had 
been sprayed for malaria control within the previous 1.5 years of the 
survey. Of these 12 households sprayed, seven reported DDT was the 
pesticide used. All homes were naturally ventilated by opening windows 
and doors. 
3.2. Exposure assessment 
Fresh Air wristbands were analysed for 70 compounds, spanning 16 
chemical classes. Of these, 35 compounds were not detected in the 
samples collected in this study, including brominated flame retardants, 
fungicides, and herbicides (Table S4). The other 35 compounds were 
detected in at least one of the samplers above the limit of detection and 
field blanks (Table S5). This included 14 PAHs, four phthalates, three 
nitroaromatics, two organochlorine pesticides, two organophosphate 
ester (OPE) flame retardants, two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), 
two chlorinated hydrocarbon, two smoking-related compounds, a 
pyrethroid-related compound, a haloether, a nitroamine, and 
isophorone. 
The distribution of detected chemicals is shown in Fig. 1. All four 
phthalates, di-n-butyl phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, 
dimethyl phthalate, were detected in 100% of the wristbands at higher 
mass loadings compared to the other chemical families, with medians of 
4.42x104, 1.74x105, 9.35x103, and 3.36x103 pg/m3. Two organochlo­
rine pesticides were analysed: p,p′-DDT and p,p’- dichlorodiphenyldi­
chloroethane (p,p′-DDD). p,p′-DDT was detected in 77.6% of the 
wristbands at a median concentration of 27.3 pg/m3 and p,p′-DDD was 
detected in 44.9% of the wristbands at a median concentration of 42.6 
pg/m3. Multiple PAHs were detected in all participants’ wristbands with 
2-methylnapthalene having the highest detected mass loading median at 
631 pg/m3 and dibenz[a,h]anthracene with the lowest median at 69.0 
pg/m3. Both OPE flame retardants analysed, TCPP and triphenyl phos­
phate (TPHP), were detected in 100% of the wristbands with median 
concentrations of 1.48x103 and 553 pg/m3, respectively. Nitroaromatics 
and isophorone generally had elevated detection mass loading, partic­
ularly 4-chloroaniline (median = 2.08x105 pg/m3; 100% detection fre­
quency). Hexachlorobutadiene (HCBD) was detected in 77.6% 
wristbands with a median concentration of 62.0 pg/m3 and hexachlo­
roethane was detected in 26.5% wristbands with a median concentra­
tion of 119 pg/m3. The haloether, bis(chloroethyl)ether (BCEE), was 
detected in 39 of the 49 wristbands with a median concentration of 489 
pg/m3. N-nitrosodiphenylamine exposure was detected for all partici­
pants with a median concentration of 529 pg/m3. Two VOCs, 1,3-dichlo­
robenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene were detected in 100% and 79.6% 
of the wristbands, respectively. Piperonyl butoxide, a synergist added to 
pyrethroid insecticide commercial mixtures, was detected in 42.9% of 
wristbands with a median concentration of 202 pg/m3. Two smoking- 
related compounds were detected in the wristbands, nicotine (6.1%) 
and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-9) (16.3%).

3.3. Comparison across exposures 
Spearman’s rank correlations were evaluated across the 35 analytes 
detected (Fig. 2). Positive relationships were found between PAHs, 
including phenanthrene and anthracene (ρ = 0.96, p = 1.67 × 10-27), 
benzo(a)pyrene and indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene (ρ = 0.96, p = 1.28 × 10- 
26), benzo[ghi]perylene and indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene (ρ = 0.94, p =
1.96 × 10-24). VOCs were also found to be correlated, including 1–3- 
dichlorobenzene and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (ρ = 0.73, p = 1.99 × 10-9). 
The two organochlorine compounds were further observed to be 
correlated, p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDD (ρ = 0.85, p = 8.45 × 10-15). Other 
correlations include hexachlorobutadiene and isophorone (ρ = 0.78, p 
= 5.28 × 10-11), dimethyl phthalate and isophorone (ρ = 0.81, p = 1.18 
× 10-12), hexachlorobutadiene and dimethyl phthalate (ρ = 0.70, p =
2.98 × 10-8). Two phthalates, di-n-octyl phthalate and di-n-butyl 
phthalate, were found to be positively related (ρ = 0.78, p = 4.16 ×
10-12).

3.4. Questionnaire and survey measures 
3.4.1. Cooking duration 
The amount of time spent cooking or burning materials during the 
three-day sampling period was recorded in the Five-Year Air Sampling 
questionnaire. Differences in airborne pollutant concentrations of PAHs 
were observed based on the durations of time spent cooking or burning 
materials (Fig. 3A). Increased durations were observed to have generally 
higher exposure concentrations across PAHs. Differences in concentra­
tions were found for 8 of the 14 compounds in the family (p ≤0.05).), 
with a p ≤0.001 difference observed for acenaphthylene. 
3.4.2. Stove type 
Differences in PAH exposure levels were found to correspond to the 
use of an electric stove or burner for indoor cooking (Fig. 3B). The type 
of cookstove used by the child’s family was recorded in the One-Week 
Postpartum Housing Survey and analysis was conducted only for those 
that lived in the same home at the Five-Year Follow-up Visit (n = 27). 
Participants that reported not having an electric stove or burner for 
cooking were observed to have higher PAH concentrations with signif­
icant differences (p ≤0.05) observed for benzo[ghi]perylene. 
3.4.3. Poverty status 
Evidence of household poverty status being associated with pollutant 
exposures was observed from wristband concentrations of PAHs and 
organochlorine pesticides. Higher exposures were found for participants 
whose household fell below the lower poverty threshold of 785 Rand per 
capita per month. This trend was apparent across all PAHs, where 9 of 
the 14 chemicals analysed were found to have a statistically significant 
difference (Fig. 4A). A similar trend was observed for organochlorine 
pesticide concentrations. Participants from households below the lower 
poverty level were observed to have higher concentrations of p,p′-DDT 
(Fig. 4A). 
3.4.4. Malaria control 
A trend towards higher exposure levels of organochlorine pesticides 
were observed for participants whose households were sprayed for 
malaria control within 1.5 years prior to sampling (n = 12) (Fig. 4B). In a 
previous study conducted in the VHEMBE cohort, Gaspar et al., similarly 
found increased p,p′-DDT exposure for mothers that reported having 
lived in a home sprayed for malaria control (Gaspar et al., 2017). Blood 
serum concentrations were measured in the mothers at the time of de­
livery. Concentrations for those from homes that had been sprayed were 
found to have five to seven times higher levels than those from homes 
that had never been sprayed. 
3.4.5. Ventilation within homes 
No association was found between pollutant concentrations and the 
outlet in which smoke escaped from participant households as reported 
in the Five-Year Follow-up Visit questionnaire. Households were all 
naturally ventilated, with smoke escaping from holes in the walls/raised 
roof, open windows/doors, chimney, or a combination of these outlets. 
None of the participants reported the use of a kitchen fan with exhaust as 
a method for ventilation. 
3.4.6. Differences by sex 
No difference in pollutant concentrations were found between fe­
male and male children across all chemical families, except for one 
phthalate. Females were found to have elevated exposure to di-n-octyl 
phthalate, compared to male participants (p ≤0.05). This was also the 
only compound observed to have higher levels in households that re­
ported cooking indoors during the 3-sampling period rather than 
outdoors. 
4. Discussion 
Wearable passive samplers have been shown to be an assessable 
method of capturing personal exposure profiles, with their use being 
particularly suited for vulnerable populations (Koelmel et al., 2021; Lin 
et al., 2020). This study is the first to present quantitative exposure 
levels of children residing in a rural region of South Africa to diverse 
mixture of environmental contaminants derived from multiple emission 
sources, including household air pollution and IRS. This study confirmed 
expected trends with the use of Fresh Air wristbands, such as positive 
relationship between cooking time and exposure level, and further 
highlight individual and household characteristics that influence per­
sonal exposure levels to select contaminants. We detected enhanced 
trends in PAH exposures associated with longer reported durations of 
burning materials during sampling period, lower household poverty 
status, and those who had previously reported not having access to an 
Fig. 4. Personal chemical exposures are shown by poverty status (A) and indoor residual spraying (B). Poverty status was evaluated as households below the lower 
poverty threshold (R785 per capita per month). Exposures were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test (p-values ≤0.05 and ≤0.01 are denoted with asterisks).

electric stove or burner for indoor cooking. We found distinct trends in 
pesticide concentrations for participant who reported that their homes 
had been recently (previous 1.5 years) sprayed for malaria control, as 
well as observed higher concentrations for households that fell below 
the lower poverty threshold. Our findings provide insights for future 
policy implications on air pollution issues in rural areas of South Africa. 
4.1. PAHs 
PAHs comprised nearly half of the contaminants detected in the 
study participants’ wristbands. Of the 14 PAHs evaluated, 13 are 
designated as high priority PAHs by the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency (US EPA) given their known toxicity to human health 
and prevalence in the environment. Five of these are classified by the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer as either carcinogenic 
(Group 1), probably carcinogenic (Group 2A), or possibly carcinogenic 
(Group 2B) to humans: benzo[a]pyrene (1), dibenz[a,h]anthracene 
(2A), indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene (2B), chrysene (2B), and benzo[k]fluo­
ranthene (2B) (IARC 2020). 
The magnitude of PAH concentrations detected were comparable 
across the chemical family, with the highest levels found for phenan­
threne and 2-methylnapthalene. The positive correlation identified 
among PAHs suggests a similar source. These airborne contaminants 
have been previously attributed to vegetation fires from agricultural 
practices and residential biomass burning in similar geographic region 
(Lacaux et al., 1991; Lacaux et al., 1996; Lammel et al., 2013). Burning 
activities within households are an important source of exposure, as 
trends with burning fuel durations were identified by increased PAH 
pollutant concentrations in the study population. Exposure to PAHs re­
sults from pyrolysis or incomplete combustion, primarily driven by 
cooking related emissions (CDC 2022; Pratiti 2021). Over 80% of the 
African region primarily relies on polluting fuels and technologies for 
cooking, and utilise these fuels, including coal, wood, charcoal, dung, 
crop residues, or kerosene, for other daily activities like heating and 
lighting (WHO 2018). Household air pollution is exacerbated by inad­
equate ventilation systems in homes, and the use of open fires and 
traditional stoves, without flues or hoods, is common. Families that lived 
in the same households for at least five years and reported not having an 
electric burner or stove available for cooking when they were first sur­
veyed were observed to have higher concentrations of PAHs, specifically 
of benzo[a]pyrene, benzo[ghi]perylene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and 
indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene (p ≤0.05). Increased concentrations were 
particularly evident for children from households falling below the 
lower poverty threshold of 785 Rand per capita per month, likely due to 
an increased use of solid fuels, which further raises concerns about long 
term exposure to elevated environmental pollutant concentrations in 
some homes within the VHEMBE cohort as compared with others. This 
finding was supported by increased use of electric stoves by children 
from families above the poverty threshold (31%) compared to other 
stove types (0%). 
The longer that study participant’s household reported cooking or 
burning materials during the sampling period, the higher PAH concen­
trations were measured. Various cooking factors influence PAH emis­
sions beyond the duration alone, such as the type of food and cooking 
style, as well as household features which can influence the movement 
of air and ventilation of pollutants in the home (Ahmed et al., 2019; 
Munyeza et al., 2020). 
4.2. Organochlorine insecticides 
p,p′-DDD and, p,p′-DDT, were found at lower concentrations 
compared to the other 33 airborne contaminants detected using the 
wristbands; however, any detection of these chemicals is notable given 
their well-recognised toxicity. DDT is used for malaria control, which is 
particularly important as the estimated number of worldwide cases of 
malaria in 2018 was 228 million with approximately 405,000 deaths, 
where young children account for most of all malaria deaths globally 
(WHO 2019). In South Africa, 9,540 malaria cases have been reported, 
resulting in 69 deaths in 2018 (WHO 2019). These cases were primary 
reported for the provinces of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal 
(Munzhedzi et al., 2021). IRS has been found to be effective in miti­
gating malaria transmission, but potential negative health effects have 
been associated with exposure to p,p′-DDT and its breakdown products 
(Barlow et al., 2001; Bouwman et al., 2006). Studies have shown that p, 
p′-DDT has a long half-life, estimated between 6 and 10 years, making 
this insecticide persistent in the environment and able to bioaccumulate 
in humans (Longnecker 2005; Wolff et al., 2000). DDT is a neurotoxin 
and endocrine disruptor and of particular concern for early childhood 
development (Eskenazi et al., 2018; Liu and Schelar 2012; Oulhote and 
Bouchard 2013; Patisaul and Adewale 2009; Slima et al., 2017; Viel 
et al., 2017). 
In South Africa, IRS with DDT has been used since the 1940s and 
continues to be a applied to control malaria vectors in Southern Africa 
despite it being banned by most countries (Eskenazi et al., 2018; Sharp 
and le Sueur 1996). DDT is typically applied to interior walls and roofs of 
traditional unpainted mud dwellings (Bouwman et al., 2006; Gaspar 
et al., 2017; Gitari et al., 2018; Verner et al., 2018). Participants in this 
study who were from homes reportedly sprayed within the previous 1.5- 
years and who were from households that fell below the lower poverty 
threshold had higher wristband DDT concentrations. These results sug­
gest that IRS applications used for malaria control are associated with 
higher exposures, similar to findings from other studies using more 
invasive serum concentration measurements (Gaspar et al., 2017; 
Whitworth et al., 2014). Furthermore, previous studies focused on adult 
exposure. This is one of the first studies showing airborne exposure 
concentrations for children. Verner et al., measured serum concentra­
tions of p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE in children within the VHEMBE cohort at 
12 and 24 months of age and found higher serum levels among children 
relative to their mothers’ at the time of at delivery (Verner et al., 2018). 
4.3. Phthalates 
The four detected phthalates, di-n-butyl phthalate, di-n-octyl 
phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, are commonly used 
as plasticisers and used to help retain color and fragrance in personal 
care products (Lyche 2011). Phthalates are suspected endocrine dis­
ruptors and childhood exposures have been linked to increased risk of 
allergic diseases, such as asthma and eczema, autism, hyperactivity, and 
neurodegenerative diseases (Jurewicz and Hanke 2011; Kim et al., 
2018). Childhood exposure is of particular concern due to the incidence 
of higher exposures compared to adults, in combination with develop­
mental effect (Braun et al., 2013; Gani et al., 2021; Hammel et al., 2020). 
The high molecular weight phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, was more 
abundant than the other three lower molecular weight compounds. 
Higher molecular weight phthalates are prevalent in indoor environ­
ments, with uses in food packaging and in building materials, and often 
exist in the particle phase and partially in the gas phase due to higher 
boiling points and lower volatility (Hammel et al., 2020; Wei et al., 
2018; Zhou et al., 2021). Di-n-octyl phthalate was the only pollutant 
observed to be higher in concentration for participants of households 
that reported cooking primarily indoors during the sampling period 
rather than outdoors. Females were found to have higher concentrations 
of di-n-octyl phthalate than males. Previous studies in Africa have shown 
that women and girls tend to have elevated exposures of criteria 
airborne pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO) than men, typically reflecting an 
overall increased time spent indoors and distinctions in household ac­
tivities including cooking (Bruce et al., 2000; Ezzati et al., 2000; Okello 
et al., 2018). More frequent use of personal care products among women 
compared to men may also lead to increased exposures (Zota and Sha­
masunder 2017). This trend was not notably observed for pollutants 
measured in our study population, aside from the single analyte, di-n- 
octyl phthalate, nor were phthalates measured in these previous studies.

4.4. Other airborne contaminants 
The detected haloether, BCEE, was found in most wristband samples 
at elevated concentrations. The compound is primarily produced for use 
in pesticides and the production of other chemicals. There is limited 
research regarding the toxicity of BCEE, but some evidence suggests this 
compound may lead to respiratory irritation, impact the nervous system, 
and body weight (ATSDR 2017). Children in this study may have inhaled 
BCEE released from industrial activity in the region. BCEE has not been 
previously detected in similar cohorts. 
HCBD was also frequently detected in participants’ wristbands. This 
chemical is typically produced as a byproduct in the manufacturing of 
other chlorinated hydrocarbons and can be used or produced in the 
production of solvents, lubricants, heat transfer liquid and hydraulic 
liquid, and pesticides (UN 2012; USEPA 2003). Few studies have 
assessed inhalation exposure of HCBD (Balmer et al., 2019; Rauert et al., 
2018; Wong et al., 2021). While the health effects of HCBD in humans 
are unclear, studies have shown HCBD to be toxic for the kidney in rats 
(Green et al., 2003; Lock and Ishmael 1979). Other evidence from ani­
mal studies suggests HCBD may be linked to irritation, nervous system 
depression, and damage to fatty liver degeneration (UN 2016). The US 
EPA has classified HCBD as a potential carcinogen and it was added as a 
persistent organic pollutant under the Stockholm Convention in 2015 
(UN 2015; USEPA 2003). 
Other detected contaminants of concern include N-nitrosodiphenyl­
amine, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, 4-chloroaniline, 2,4-dinitrotoluene, nitro­
benzene, and isophorone. Aside from a study comparing personal VOC 
concentrations for women living in rural small holder dairy farms which 
found that 1,4-dichlorobenzene concentrations were lower for women 
who used biogas for fuel for cooking, rather than solid biomass, these 
airborne contaminants have not been measured in rural populations in 
Africa (Dohoo et al., 2015). 
4.5. Limitations and future directions 
Fresh Air wristbands facilitate comprehensive exposure assessment 
to environmental contaminants at different developmental stages given 
their non-invasive wearable design. Questions, however, remain 
regarding the comparability of this emerging technology with tradi­
tional exposure assessment tools in various sampling conditions and is 
the subject of ongoing studies. This study conducted targeted analysis of 
70 contaminants collected by the wristbands. While this assessment 
provides broad coverage of airborne exposures, this panel of contami­
nants represents only a fraction of environmental factors to which par­
ticipants may be exposed through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal 
pathways. Exposure to these chemicals was evaluated over three days, 
which we acknowledge provides only a snapshot of children’s envi­
ronments. Compared to other assessment approaches, such as mea­
surement of exposure markers in blood which offer insights into longer- 
term exposure trends for persistent chemicals, the three-day monitoring 
period is indicative of more recent exposures. Exposures have also been 
commonly evaluated using urine samples. It is important to recognize 
that urinary markers are representative of exposures over an even 
shorter window (~24 h). As part of this study, information collected 
from questionnaires was used to interpret results. The children that 
participated in this study resided in rural regions of South Africa with a 
high prevalence of malaria. The practice of IRS for infectious disease 
control in this area limits generalizability of results to children living in 
other parts of the country. 
Exposure assessment of participants in the VHEMBE cohort using the 
Fresh Air wristbands is ongoing with the aim of understanding the role 
of environmental contaminants on child growth and development, and 
to develop strategies to mitigate these exposures. Based on results from 
the current study, additional questions were added to the VHEMBE 
questionnaires regarding “trash” and “plastic” burning. We plan to 
evaluate environmental exposures longitudinally as additional 
wristband samples are collected from children. Expanded targeted 
analysis to include other compounds of interest, such as p,p-DDE and 
other pyrethroids, are planned as part of future studies, as well as non- 
targeted chemical analyses of wristband samplers. 
5. Conclusions 
Wearable passive samplers enable widescale evaluation of airborne 
pollutant exposures and are particularly suited for vulnerable pop­
ulations, such as children. This study is the first of its kind, evaluating 
exposures using passive sampling techniques for children in rural Africa 
to assess exposures from known sources such as IRS and biomass 
burning. The findings indicate exposure to a variety of airborne pollut­
ants with suspected adverse health effects including organochlorine 
pesticides used for malaria control (DDT), PAHs resulting from com­
bustion, and phthalates. Trends associated with higher levels of expo­
sure to select analytes were identified in the study population: longer 
durations of cooking or burning materials, lower poverty households, 
homes without previous access to an electric stove or burner, and 
households that were sprayed for malaria control. Findings demonstrate 
the utility of the Fresh Air wristband at highlighting differences in 
households that may contribute to increased exposures. Understanding 
trends that lead to increased exposure will advance in the development 
of strategies to mitigate such exposures. Exposure to toxic environ­
mental contaminants suggest a need for further evaluation of children’s 
pollutant exposures in South Africa and other rural areas in low- and 
middle-income countries.

Open waste burning emissions constitute a significant source of air pollution affecting human health in India. In 
regions where cleaner fuels have displaced solid biofuel usage, open waste burning is rapidly becoming one of 
the largest sources of airborne human class-I-carcinogens and particulate matter. As the establishment of waste 
management infrastructure in rural India is likely to take years, we explore whether health-relevant emissions 
can be reduced by legalizing the burning of dry non-biodegradable waste in improved devices. We measure the 
emission factors of 76 VOCs, CH4, CO, and CO2 from different types of waste burned in two different improved 
devices, a burn basket and a local water heater. Based on our experiments, we create four “what-if” intervention 
scenarios to assess the improvement of air quality due to the emission reductions that can be accomplished by 
four management strategies. We find that substituting the traditional, more polluting water heating fuels with 
dry plastic waste across rural India can reduce primary emissions (e.g., −29 Ggy−1 for benzene) and ozone 
formation potential (−2960 Ggy−1) from open waste burning. When dry waste is used in lieu of more polluting 
fuels, and its burning serves a purpose, the net class-I-carcinogen benzene emissions, would be halved compared 
to the present. The change in emissions for the class-I carcinogen 1,3-butadiene would become net negative. This 
happens because the emissions avoided when part of the solid biofuel currently used in rural India is replaced by 
plastic waste (4.1 (1.2–4.1) Ggy−1) exceed the waste burning emissions of this compound (3 (1.2–3.7) Ggy−1) by 
so much, that residential sector emission reductions offset all waste burning emissions including those of landfill 
fires. Our study demonstrates that India’s air quality can be improved by permitting and promoting the use of dry 
packaging waste in lieu of traditional biofuels and by promoting improved burning devices.   
1. Introduction 
One of the most conspicuous causes of pollution in today’s world is 
the rapid increase in municipal solid waste generation. The proper 
disposal of this excessive and ever-increasing solid waste is a challenge 
for mankind. Ideally, proper waste management includes efficient 
collection, safe transfer and storage, adequate treatment, and resource 
recovery (Shekdar, 2009). It has been universally recognized that proper 
waste management starts with waste segregation at the waste source. 
While segregated paper, glass and metal, and certain types of plastic can 
be profitably recycled, biodegradable waste can be converted to 
compost or biogas without significant financial loss. In high-income 
countries, biodegradable wet waste is typically collected separately 
(Di Maria and Micale, 2013; Slater and Frederickson, 2001) and mixed 
household waste, comprising primarily of packaging materials with low 
recycling value can, therefore, be subjected to thermal recycling in 
waste-to-energy plants (Cucchiella et al., 2017). Waste-to-energy plants 
are cost-intensive, and hard to implement in developing countries due to 
several challenges. Firstly, the waste composition is different from 
developed countries. Currently, mixed municipal waste in India contains 
primarily biodegradable waste and inerts (Chaudhary et al., 2021) and 
has an energy content of only 6.8–9.8 MJ/kg and high moisture content 
of 42–47% (Kumar and Goel, 2009; Singh et al., 2018). Secondly, urban 
households are not always used to segregating non-biodegradable dry

and biodegradable wet waste at the source (Chattopadhyay et al., 2009; 
Vidanaarachchi et al., 2006). Thirdly, high value recyclables are 
removed from the waste stream early on by households or informal re­
cyclers (Forbid et al., 2011; Nandy et al., 2015; Sharma et al., 2019), 
leaving the municipality with low-value, hard to segregate waste, and no 
means to partially recover transport and treatment cost. Fourthly, the 
willingness to pay for waste disposal is low (Awunyo-Vitor et al., 2013; 
Vassanadumrongdee and Kittipongvises, 2018), as dumping or open 
waste burning are viewed as free alternatives (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). 
In India, poor last-mile connectivity of waste collection services re­
sults in persistent pollution caused by waste dumped in streets, vacant 
plots, low lying areas, barren lands, open surface drains, and natural 
water bodies (Lebreton et al., 2017; Sigler, 2014). Multiple studies have 
shown that plastic waste, once littered, persists in the environment and 
aquatic ecosystems for decades to centuries (Egger et al., 2020; Krause 
et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2021a; Lwanga et al., 2017; Martin et al., 
2017) and cycles back into the food chain. Hence, concerned citizens 
often 
view 
open 
burning 
as 
an 
acceptable 
way 
to 
clear 
non-biodegradable waste. As a consequence, open waste burning with 
its high NMVOC emission factors, has become a significant source 
contributing 1.4–9.3 Tgy−1 NMVOC emissions that amount to 10–42% 
of India’s total NMVOC budget (Chaudhary et al., 2021; Sharma et al., 
2022; Sharma et al., 2019). Backyard burning as alternative to littering 
of non-biodegradable waste, persisted even in rural areas of high-income 
nations (Lemieux et al., 2000; Lighthall and Kopecky, 2000; Wiedinmyer 
et al., 2014) till the mid-2000s. Unfortunately, some low- and 
middle-income countries have adopted open waste burning bans shortly 
after developed nations did, without implementing adequate waste 
collection and treatment infrastructure (India, Brazil, Indonesia). As a 
consequence, waste is often dumped and subjected to open burning 
under cover of darkness in low-lying areas of community land, in road 
ditches, and/or next to water bodies, rather than within the property of 
the waste generator. This makes the culprit responsible for the fire more 
difficult to fine, but results in inefficient smouldering burns of wet 
waste. Smouldering burns of wet waste have 1–2 orders of magnitude 
higher emission factors for many ozone and SOA precursors and carci­
nogenic PAHs than flaming fires (Sharma et al., 2019; Stockwell et al., 
2016). The emission factors reported for PM2.5 and a known human 
carcinogen benzo(α)pyrene for damp plastic/foil wrapper waste fires are 
9 and 5 times higher, respectively, than those recorded from the burning 
of mixed dry waste (Jayarathne et al., 2018). The fact that fuel moisture 
and combustion conditions modify emission factors has been recognized 
by several authors (Lemieux et al., 2000; Sharma et al., 2019; Stockwell 
et al., 2015; Stockwell et al., 2016). 
In this study, we quantitatively assess the reduction in waste burning 
emissions within India using low-cost tools, that can be accomplished by 
existing waste collection practices. We propose to simply encourage 
flaming burning of certain types of dry waste and decentralized thermal 
recycling. In particular, we focus on how the emission factors of several 
types of dry packaging waste and of mixed biodegradable and non- 
biodegradable waste burned in low-cost improved devices compared 
to the emission factors of the normal clandestine burns. Based on our 
experiments, we create four “what-if” emission inventories containing 
the gridded emission that would have occurred if a particular low-cost 
waste burning related policy intervention had been adopted on a large 
scale across rural India in 2020. We propose to acknowledge, that 
certain types of non-biodegradable waste will have to get burnt 
throughout much of rural India for the foreseeable future. The envi­
ronmental impacts of the micro-plastic pollution caused by littering 
these waste types exceeds the air quality impact of burning them. 
However, we propose that the dry-waste burning should displace the use 
of more polluting solid biofuels in the residential sector. To demonstrate 
that this is a viable strategy, we compare the emission factors of tradi­
tional fuels such as cow dung and firewood used in an improved water 
heater with those of dry waste burnt in the same device. We find that the 
emission factors for certain health relevant compounds are 2–3 orders of 
magnitude lower when dry plastic waste is used in lieu of traditional 
fuels. We subsequently evaluate the emission reductions that can be 
accomplished on a pan-India basis by promoting this fuel substitution 
strategy. 
2. Material and methods 
In this study we evaluate how the emission factor of waste burning 
changes when instead of being subjected to open burning in heaps 
(Fig. 1a) waste is burned with sufficient air supply in a burn basket 
(Fig. 1b) or locally manufactured improved water heater (Fig. 1c). Both 
devices are designed to reduce emissions by improving the combustion 
efficiency. Both types of devices were observed to be used for the pur­
pose of waste disposal in some rural locations during field visits. We 
subsequently implement several possible intervention scenarios in our 
open waste burning emission inventory for India (OWBEII) for the year 
2020 to evaluate, what the emissions would have been, if a certain 
possible intervention had been implemented across rural India in the 
same year. We evaluate the following scenarios as described in Fig. 2. 
Scenario I: The amount of waste burned in rural India does not 
change. However, the process is legalized and improved devices such as 
burn baskets are used to burn the waste. 
Scenario II: Only dry waste generated in rural India is burned in the 
improved device, while the wet, biodegradable waste is diverted to 
decentralized composting plant or biogas plants. 
Scenario III: Only dry plastic and multilayer packaging waste 
generated in rural India is burned in the improved device. Biodegradable 
waste, non-recycled paper, and non-reusable cotton/wool fabrics are 
diverted to decentralized composting plants. Other waste which com­
prises mostly of certain types of plastic such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
e-waste, old shoes, torn synthetic cloth are picked up and subjected to 
centralized treatment, because the health-relevant emissions from the 
decentralized burning of chlorine containing waste are high. It has been 
shown that the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD), polychlorinated 
dibenzofurans (PCDF) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) EFs from 
open waste burning are minimal as long as the waste burnt does not 
contain any PVC or added Cl sources (Gullett et al., 2001; Hedman et al., 
2005). Hence a strong focus on the collection of very polluting waste 
classes and a diversion of these types of waste from open burning has the 
potential to mitigate the emission of health relevant compounds and 
HCl. Since biomedical waste cannot be stored for a monthly or annual 
pickup, we propose that household-level biomedical waste generation 
should instead be reduced. This could be accomplished by establishing a 
program which provides a free reusable menstrual cup and menstrual 
hygiene training to all girls in their first year of secondary school. 
Scenario IV: Only dry plastic and multilayer packaging waste 
generated in rural India is burned in the improved device. The material 
is collected throughout 8 months (March to October) of the year to be 
burned in winter (November to February) in an improved water heater. 
In this scenario the burned plastic waste displaces dung cakes and fire­
wood that would have otherwise been used to heat the bathing water. 
The quantity of traditional fuel(s) substituted, is calculated using the 
energy content in MJ contained in the plastic and packaging waste 
assuming the same is collected and accumulated within the household 
throughout the summer months. 
The numbers detailing how much of each waste type (biodegradable, 
paper, plastic, glass and metal, and other waste) is subjected to the 
different types of treatment in the default case and in each of the 
different scenarios, is available in the supplementary text S1 to S5 and its 
accompanying Figs. S1–S5. 
2.1. Quantification of emission factors for waste burning in improved 
devices 
To calculate emission factors for this study, a set of 21 experiments 
were conducted at Air Quality Station II, IISER Mohali (30.6650◦N, 
P. Chaudhary et al.

76.7300◦S) using different waste materials such as mixed wet household 
waste (N = 3), mixed dry household waste (N = 5), biomedical waste 
(diaper, sanitary napkins) (N = 6), dry plastic waste (N = 3), dry paper 
waste (N = 1), and other waste (shoes and textile, N = 4) as fuel. In this 
study we did not measure fuel moisture content. Fuels such as plastic, 
paper and mixed packaging materials were classified as “dry” when the 
waste was segregated at source. Mixed wet household waste refers to 
content inside the usual single dustbin found in the average Indian 
household, which contains approximately 66% kitchen waste (fruit and 
vegetable peals and used tea leaves), 20%–30% plastic and paper waste 
and ~15% of other waste. The whole air samples were collected in 
electropolished stainless steel canisters (SilcoCan with RAVE, Restek 
Corporation US) using a Teflon VOC pump at flow rate of ~5.5 L/min 
and pressurised up to 30psi as described in our previous works (Chandra 
et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2018). A Teflon membrane filter (0.45 μm pore 
size) was attached to the sampling inlet line to restrict any dust and 
particulate matter entering the canisters. The waste used in these burn 
experiments was collected locally from the faculty houses situated in 
IISER Mohali Campus. 
Samples were analysed offline for NMVOCs using a thermal 
desorption gas chromatography flame ionization detector (TD-GC-FID; 
Model GC-FID 7890 B, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, US) and a 
high-sensitivity proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS; 
HS Model 11-07HS-088, Ionicon Analytik Gesellschaft, Austria). NMHCs 
were measured using TD-GC-FID and OVOCs were measured using PTR- 
MS. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) were quantified using a 
cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS) (Model G2508, Picarro, Santa 
Clara, CA, USA). CO was quantified using a nondispersive infrared 
(NDIR) filter correlation spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Model 
No. 48i). The measurements were performed using a dynamic dilution 
setup to dilute the concentrated samples while introducing them into the 
respective instruments. No dilution tunnel was used at the time of 
sample collection. Detailed descriptions of these instruments and the 
protocol followed for analysis are available in our previous works 
(Chandra and Sinha, 2016; Hakkim et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021b; 
Sinha et al., 2014), where the instrumental analysis, calibration, po­
tential interferences at same Townsend ratio (~135 Td) as used in 
current study were already discussed and described. To summarize 
briefly, fragmentation effects for acetic acid were corrected according to 
the method described in Sarkar et al. (2016) and the formaldehyde

humidity dependence was corrected as described in Cui et al. (2016). 
Emission factors (EFs) were calculated using the carbon mass balance 
approach described in detail in the previous works (Akagi et al., 2011; 
Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Chandra et al., 2017; Yokelson et al., 1999). 
2.2. Quantification of the device efficiency for the improved water heater 
To calculate the cold start device efficiency of the improved water 
heater, a set of experiments were conducted at Air Quality Station II, 
IISER Mohali. The device which has a capacity of 19.5 L was filled with 
water of known temperature and fire was set with a known amount of 
fuel. After the completion of burn the temperature of water was 
measured again. The device efficiency was calculated using equation 
(1). 
DEf(%) = 4.186 ​ KJ/kg˚C ​ * ​ ΔT ​ * ​ V ​ * ​ 100
ECf *Wf
(1)  
where, DEf = Device efficiency with f fuel type (%), ΔT = Final tem­
perature – Initial temperature (˚C), V = Volume of water (kg), ECf =
Energy content of f fuel type (KJ/g), Wf = Weight of fuel used (g). 
We conducted these burns repeatedly with different types of fuel 
with known composition such as dung cakes, firewood, paper, and 
specific types of different plastic polymers. 
2.3. Quantification of the ozone formation potential and SOA formation 
potential 
The tropospheric ozone (O3) formation potential was calculated with 
equation (2).

3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Emission factors of different waste classes and other fuels in the 
improved device 
Fig. 3A shows the comparison of average emission factors (gkg−1) of 
59 NMVOC’s species emitted from open garbage fires reported in liter­
ature (Chaudhary et al., 2021) with the emissions that arise when 
different types of waste are burnt using the devices. We find that for 
most of the compounds the emission factors for mixed household waste 
burned in the improved device are closest to the waste burning emission 
factors reported in laboratory experiments (Stewart et al., 2021). The 
same is also true for the emission factors from clothes, shoes and 
biomedical waste (labelled as “other waste” in Fig. 3A) burned in the 
improved device. Laboratory experiments reported low burn-to-burn 
variability and, hence, contributed disproportionally to the uncer­
tainty weighted emission factor of all prior studies used to construct the 
open waste burning emission inventory for India (OWBEII) for the year 
2020 (Chaudhary et al., 2021). When only mixed dry household waste 
was burned in the improved device, the average emission factors for 
only 7 (benzene, styrene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,3 butadiene, acet­
ylene, 3-methylpentane, propyne) out of 59 NMVOCs were marginally 
higher than the open waste burning emission factors reported in the 
literature (Christian et al., 2010; Akagi et al., 2011; Stockwell et al., 
2015; Stockwell et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2019; Stewart et al., 2021), 
but only the EFs of three compounds (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (at 2σ 
confidence interval), 3-methylpentane (1σ), propyne (1σ)) were found 
to be significantly enhanced when evaluated with Mann–Whitney U test. 
No statistically significant difference was found for two compounds with 
lower average EFs (acetonitrile and ethene). The remaining compounds 
had significantly lower average EFs (See Table S3 for details). For ben­
zene, a known human carcinogen, the EF of mixed wet waste burnt in 
the improved devices was 1.05 ± 1.19 gkg-1 (MCE = 0.969 ± 0.015) and 
comparable to the EF of mixed dry household waste burnt in the 
improved devices (1.09 ± 0.89 gkg-1) (MCE = 0.970 ± 0.027), and the 
EF for laboratory burns (0.75 ± 0.25 gkg-1, MCE = 0.97 ± 0.01) 
(Stewart et al., 2021) of MSW. It was lower than the EF for other types of 
waste such as biomedical waste, clothes, or old shoes 3.84 ± 5.82 (MCE 
= 0.968 ± 0.017 (1σ)) gkg−1, and the average EF previously reported for 
real world open garbage fires (2.1 ± 1.5 gkg-1 MCE = 0.90 ± 0.02 (1σ)) 
(Stockwell et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2019). A reduced major axis 
regression (RMA) between the combustion efficiency and benzene EFs 
reported by various authors across the literature reveals a weak anti­
correlation (R = −0.47), and this observation forms the basis for the 
deployment of devices that promote a higher combustion efficiency to 
reduce emissions. However, the experiments with synthetic textiles and 
shoes and the high fire-to-fire variability indicate that the nature of the 
material burnt also impacts emission factors. 
Unfortunately, benzene is not the only human class-1 carcinogen 
emitted in large amounts from open waste burning. Chaudhary et al. 
(2021) flagged that open waste burning is a significant direct source of 
carcinogenic formaldehyde. The average EF for formaldehyde from 
mixed wet waste burnt in the improved device (0.16 ± 0.1 gkg-1) was 
found to be higher than that of mixed dry household waste burnt in the 
improved device (0.03 ± 0.01 gkg-1, (2σ)), and lower than the open 
waste burning EF (0.4 ± 0.07 gkg-1, (1σ)) used in the 2020 OWBEII 
(Chaudhary et al., 2021). The emission factors of mixed wet waste and 
“other” waste types (0.67 ± 1.11 gkg-1) burnt in the improved device 
were not statistically significantly different from those of mixed wet 
waste. 
A third class-I human carcinogen emitted from open waste burning in 
significant amounts, not discussed in detail in the literature so far, is 1,3- 
butadiene. The average EF for mixed wet waste burnt in the improved 
device (0.32 ± 0.21 gkg-1) was found to be higher than that of mixed dry 
household waste (0.09 ± 0.05 gkg-1, (2σ)) burnt in the improved device. 
The EF was not significantly different than that of other types of waste 
burnt in the improved device (0.74 ± 0.65 gkg-1), and the EF from 
previous work (0.04 ± 0.05 gkg-1) used to build the 2020 OWBEII 
(Chaudhary et al., 2021). Overall, it appears that the use of the improved 
device for the sake of disposal alone is unlikely to decrease the popu­
lation exposure to this airborne class-1 human carcinogen. However, 
when waste is used in the improved water heater to substitute for other, 
more polluting fuels with 2–3 order of magnitude higher emission fac­
tors for this carcinogenic compound, namely cow dung or firewood, the 
overall emissions in rural India reduce. In fact, the replacement of other 
water heating fuel with dry plastic waste can reduce the human expo­
sure so much that emissions from waste burning become net negative. 
This happens because the emissions avoided by displacing solid biofuel 
through decentralized thermal recycling of 5 (2.5–5) Tgy−1 of plastic 
waste in rural North India (4.1 (1.2–4.1) Ggy−1) are larger than the total 
open waste burning emissions of this compound from all waste fires 
including landfill fires in rural and urban India combined (3 (1.2–3.7) 
Ggy−1), despite the fact that these fires continue to burn 54 (22–67) 
Tgy−1 of waste in this scenario. 
Fig. 3B shows the emission factors for different types of fuel-device 
combinations currently used for water heating during the cold months 
and compares them to the emissions that arise during the use of dry 
plastic waste in the improved water heater. Generally, people use wood 
(shown in brown square boxes) and dung cakes (shown in grey square 
boxes) as fuel and heat their water on a traditional stove or in the 
improved device locally known as “hamam”. Clearly, dung cake burnt in 
traditional stoves (shown in black circles) cause the highest amount of 
air pollution for the same amount of water heated, while dry plastic 
packaging waste used to fire an improved water heater (shown in green 
triangles) causes least air pollution for a fixed amount of energy deliv­
ered (MJ−1). The significance level of the emission reductions that can 
be accomplished by replacing traditional fuels in a traditional stove or 
improved water heater by dry waste in an improved water heater for 
each compound is available in Table S3. The emissions from dung cake 
and wood burnt in traditional stoves were calculated by averaging 
values reported in the literature (Fleming et al., 2018; Stockwell et al., 
2016) as shown in Table S1. The device efficiency for traditional stoves 
was taken from the literature (Habib et al., 2004). The use of these 
improved water heaters is currently largely restricted to the moun­
tainous regions of northern India. If the device is promoted across the 
IGP then the use of the improved heater itself will reduces the emission 
even for fuels such as dung cake and wood due to the higher device 
efficiency of the improved water heater and better combustion condi­
tions inside this device. However, the largest air quality benefits arise 
from substituting the traditional water heating fuel with dry packaging 
waste. 
In this study, we haven’t measured particulate matter emissions from 
the improved devices. For closest approximation, Fire no. 49 reporting 
the emission factors for dry plastic waste burnt in an open fire (Jayar­
athne et al., 2018) is used as proxy for the dry mixed waste burnt in the

devices. This would be the upper limit of particulate emissions from the 
devices. Other plastic fires (Fire no. 15 and 16) reported in the study 
which contained plastic waste that was moist (Jayarathne et al., 2018) 
cannot be used as proxy for dry waste burning and had higher emission 
factors. Non-biodegradable dry waste is often disposed of beside a pond 
or the water bodies in South Asia and set on fire in moist conditions. The 
fact that fuel moisture and combustion conditions modify EFs can 
clearly be seen when PM2.5 EF of Fire no. 49 are compared with the EF of 
Fire no. 15 and 16 (Jayarathne et al., 2018). When the damp plastic 
waste is burnt the EF of PM2.5 increases 10 times compared to the EF 
recorded for dry mix waste (Jayarathne et al., 2018). Table S2 shows the 
comparison of average EFs of particulate matter emitted from the dry 
mixed waste burnt (proxy for device) with the traditional fuels (wood 
and dung) used in traditional cooking devices present in India (reported 
by Jayarathne et al., 2018). 
Overall, the lower EF of PM2.5 of dry waste lowers emissions per MJ 
by factor of 4 and 35 in comparison to wood and dung burning in 
traditional stoves, respectively. Of course, waste burning impacts 
particulate matter levels not only through the emission of primary 
particles, but also through the formation of secondary organic (Li et al., 
2021) and inorganic (Pawar et al., 2022) aerosol. The impact of VOC 
emissions on the formation of SOA has been evaluated in the present 
study, by including the change of the SOA formation potential in 
response to interventions. The evaluation of the waste burning impact 
on SIA mass loadings goes beyond the scope of the present study and can 
only be performed using a chemical transport model due to the tem­
perature and RH dependent equilibrium between gas phase HCl and NH3 
and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). EF of benzo(α)pyrene, a known 
human carcinogen from dry waste is lowered by a factor of 4 and 11 in 
comparison to wood and dung in traditional stoves, respectively. The EF 
for most of the PAHs from dry plastic waste are also lower than those 
from cow dung and fuel wood burning. On the other hand, the EF of Pb 
and Cd from dry waste burning are higher than those from fuelwood and 
cow dung burning. Household waste burning is considered to be a major 
contributor to health relevant PCDD/PCDF/PCBs emissions in many 
countries. It has been well documented that PCDD/PCDF/PCBs

emissions from waste samples with a high PVC content are 4–5 orders of 
magnitude higher than those from waste samples with a low PVC con­
tent (Gulette et al., 2001). Hence targeted campaigns for the collection 
and scientific disposal of this specific type of plastic can yield significant 
public health dividends. In the Indian context most PVC burning occurs 
during the burning of biomedical waste (blood, catheter & IV bags), 
during informal recycling of e-waste (burning of wire coating & insu­
lation material), vehicle scrapping, and demolition activities (burning of 
broken PVC pipes and floors). PCDD/PCDF/PCBs emission factors dur­
ing the burning of ordinary household and garbage dump waste are at 
the lower end of the range reported elsewhere across the globe (Ajay 
et al., 2022). Even when PVC is burnt, fuel moisture content and com­
bustion conditions matter, as smouldering burns have orders of magni­
tude higher PCDD/PCDF/PCBs emission factors than flaming fires 
(Gullett et al., 2010; Solorzano-Ochoa et al., 2012). Hence the in­
terventions proposed will reduce emissions compared to the current 
status quo, even when the wrong plastic waste ends up getting burnt in 
the device. 
3.2. Changes in the gridded emissions of different waste management 
scenarios 
Fig. 4 shows the changes in the gridded emissions of benzene, 
formaldehyde, and 1,3 butadiene that will occur with the implementa­
tion of scenario I, II, III and IV. It also shows the changes in the ozone 
formation potential and the SOA formation potential of the emissions for 
these four scenarios. 
In the scenario I, the amount of waste burned does not change and 
the burns involve a mixture of biodegradable wet waste and dry waste. 
In that case shifting open waste burns to controlled burns of mixed 
household waste in an improved device will not reduce the emission flux 
for two out of three carcinogenic compounds. The emissions of tropo­
spheric ozone (+1405 (310–2960) Ggy−1) and SOA (+16 (4–34) Ggy−1) 
precursors, too, would increase if this scenario is implemented. 80% of 
mixed household waste left behind after segregating recyclables is 
biodegradable/kitchen waste (Chaudhary et al., 2021). This type of 
waste is too moist to burn well in any device including waste-to-energy 
plants (Sharholy et al., 2008). Due to the high fuel moisture, the 
improved device is incapable of improving the combustion conditions. 
This makes scenario I undesirable and necessitates interventions that 
reduce the overall amount of waste burnt in comparison to the status 
quo. 
In the scenario II, we propose to replace mixed open waste burns 
with dry mixed waste burns in an improved device. This reduced the 
emission flux for two out of three carcinogenic compounds. An increase 
of 1 (0.5–2.5) Ggy−1 in emission flux of 1,3 butadiene was observed, 
whereas the emissions of benzene and formaldehyde were lower than 
the baseline emissions in the OWBEII 2020 by −2 (−10 – +2) Ggy−1 and 
-7 (−14 to −1) Ggy−1, respectively. The production of O3 and SOA 
precursors were also lowered by −1580 (−3480 to −280) Ggy−1 and -9 
(−28 to −0.3) Ggy−1, respectively. Thus, the burning of all non- 
recyclable dry mixed waste in an improved device can be considered a 
viable option that reduces plastic pollution in water bodies and soils and 
yields only moderate air quality returns. If this solution was imple­
mented the source-segregated biodegradable waste could be directed 
towards biogas or composting plants, while inert waste could be land­
filled. However, Table S1 shows that the EF for rubber shoes, synthetic 
cloths and biomedical waste are very high in comparison to the EF of dry 
packaging and paper waste. Hence, the human exposure to air pollution 
could be reduced below the level of scenario II, if we develop the 
capability to pick up these types of waste for centralized treatment. Only 
8 (3–13) out of 192 (102–231) Tgy−1 of the waste generated in the year 
2020 is non-inert “other” waste such as biomedical waste, e-waste, PVC, 
clothes, rubber or leather (Chaudhary et al., 2021). Much larger air 
quality benefits for moderate collection and transport costs appear 
possible. 
In the scenario III, we explore the option of decentralized treatment 
of segregated biodegradable waste, pickup and centralized treatment for 
the 2 (0.6–5) Tgy−1 “other” non-inert waste produced in rural India, but 
decentralized burning in the improved device for dry plastic packaging 
waste. This scenario yields significantly lower benzene and formalde­
hyde emission fluxes without increasing 1,3 butadiene emissions. It re­
duces benzene and formaldehyde emissions 15% and 27%, respectively, 
below the baseline levels in the OWBEII 2020 (Chaudhary et al., 2021). 
The emissions of O3 and SOA precursors were lowered by −1980 
(−4390 to −400) Ggy−1 and -14 (−32 to −2) Ggy−1, respectively. For 
certain subsets of this waste, programs targeted at reducing the waste 
generation could yield substantial social dividends, and air quality 
benefits at much lower cost than the pickup and treatment. The cost of 
sanitary napkins imposes a significant burden on low-income house­
holds, while the recurring cost of waste collection burdens municipal­
ities. Programs that promote menstrual hygiene awareness and 
distributing reusable silicone cups among school going girls could 
significantly reduce the amount of biomedical waste requiring safe 
disposal throughout the girl’s lifetime and improve educational out­
comes (Pokhrel et al., 2021; van Eijk et al., 2018). If such reusable 
products were used by all of India’s population the biomedical waste 
generated would reduce by approximately by 1.4Tgy−1. Such programs 
could be cross financed through the environmental cess. 
However, for some “other” waste types such as PVC, rubber products 
and synthetic clothes pickup and centralized treatment appears to be the 
best solution. Plastic and rubber pyrolysis into petrochemical feedstock 
(Palos et al., 2021) or pyrolysis oil – diesel blends (Yarlagadda and 
Ravuru, 2021) is increasingly viewed as a viable alternative to thermal 
recycling (Jeswani et al., 2021). It hence appears possible to recover the 
costs incurred while picking up such materials for centralized treatment, 
particularly when one considers that segregated dry plastic waste can be 
stored and picked up monthly. 
Presently, many Indian households use traditional fuels to cook and 
heat bathing water. Since we recommend burning dry packaging waste 
in improved devices it appears possible to increase the air quality ben­
efits over and above the benefits incurred by implementing scenario III 
by encouraging households to collect and store the dry packaging waste 
and burn it only when hot water is required or co-combust it in the stove 
year around. This can be viewed as decentralized form of thermal 
recycling, and a substitute for centralized waste-to-energy plants. 
We, therefore, calculate scenario IV, in which dry plastic packaging 
waste is burnt as a substitute for traditional fuels in a local water heater 
during winter. This results in avoided emissions from the traditional 
fuels that would have otherwise been used to fulfil the wintertime hot 
water demand. Fig. 4 shows that the net emissions of benzene (−29 (−42 
to −7) Ggy−1), formaldehyde (−13 (−21 to −3) Ggy−1) and 1,3 buta­
diene (−4.1 (−4.1 to −1.2) Ggy−1) are much lower than those of sce­
nario III. Dry plastic waste has a much higher calorific value (Table 1) 
and lower emission factors than traditional fuels. We observed 
maximum decrease in the emissions of O3 (−2960 (−5100 to −730)

Our calculations demonstrate that, contrary to the popular perception, 
plastic waste burning can result in air quality improvements when the 
waste burning is serving a purpose and substituting for a more polluting 
fuel. The largest air quality benefits are obtained over IGP regions where 
cow dung is the dominate residential fuel. 
4. Conclusions 
In this study we demonstrate that legalizing waste burning and 
encouraging households to substitute traditional water heating fuels 
with dry plastic waste can reduce emissions from open waste burning 
and improve air quality. 
The highest air quality benefits can be achieved by implementing 
scenario IV. In this scenario rural biodegradable waste is managed by 
decentralized compost or by putting it into biogas plants. Non-recycled 
and non-collected mixed plastic and multi-layered packaging waste is 
used to replace traditional water heating fuels. The emission factors of 
traditional solid biofuels are 2–3 order of magnitude higher than those 
of dry waste for most compounds. Hence “smarter” waste burning can 
result in net air quality improvements. Education and outreach material 
spreading the knowledge that burning dry packaging waste in a stove or 
water heater is less harmful to human health than using cow dung or 
wood in the same device can spread this practice. However, it is very 
important that the outreach material enables households to identify PVC 
and Teflon and exclude these materials from the burning. They need to 
understand why these are not “normal” plastics that can be safely burnt. 
The burning of normal plastic polymers such as polyethylene, poly­
propylene and polystyrene is unlikely to cause HCl emission and causes 
lower emissions of human carcinogens than the burning of dung cakes 
and firewood. Polyvinylchloride burning, on the other hand, will emit 
large amounts of HCl, PCDD, PCDF and PCBs and Teflon burning will 
emit HF. Hence the decentralized burning of PVC and Teflon waste must 
be avoided. The inert fraction of “other” waste can simply be landfilled. 
The non-inert fraction of “other” waste category has to be managed by 
hybrid approach. The biodegradable fraction (e.g., cotton clothes and 
cotton napkins) should be composted. Sanitary pads should be replaced 
with menstrual cups or cotton napkins to reduce the production of non- 
biodegradable biomedical waste requiring special treatment. Other 
items such as e-waste, PVC, rubber and leather etc. should be picked up 
monthly and treated at specialized facilities. 
This intervention can be implemented in neighbouring nations such 
as Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan and other developing countries 
where the majority of households still rely on solid biofuel (Das et al., 
2018; Hossain et al., 2014; Stockwell et al., 2016; Wiedinmyer et al., 
2014; Yasin et al., 2017).

In households, municipal solid waste (MSW) is often burned along with wood to get rid of waste, to help in 
ignition or simply to reduce fuel costs. The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of household waste 
combustion, along with wood, on the physical and chemical properties of particulate emissions in a flue gas of a 
masonry heater. 
The MSW burning alongside wood increased average particulate matter (PM) mass (65%), lung deposited 
surface areas (LDSA, 15%), black carbon (BC, 65%) concentrations and the average particle size in the flue gas. 
The influence of MSW was smaller during ignition and burning phases, but especially during fuel additions, the 
mass, number, and LDSA concentrations increased significantly and their size distributions moved towards larger 
particles. For wood burning the trace metal emissions were relatively low, but significant increase (3.3–179 -fold 
increase over cycle) was seen when MSW was burned along the wood. High ratios were observed especially 
during fuel addition phases but, depending on compounds, also during ignition and burning end phases. The 
highest ratios were observed for chloride compounds (HCl, KCl, NaCl). The observed increase in light-absorbing 
particle, trace metal and BC concentrations in flue gas when adding wood with MSW are likely to have negative 
impacts on air quality, visibility, human health and climate. Furthermore, metals may also affect the condition 
and lifetime of the burning device due to corrosion.   
1. Introduction 
As traffic and industrial emissions are continuously decreasing due to 
stricter emissions regulations, the level of small-scale biomass burning 
emissions has remained stable and has in many cases steadily increased 
(e.g. Savolahti et al., 2016, 2019; Helin et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2017). 
Biomass burning produces a complex mixture of particulate and gaseous 
emissions (e.g. Chen et al., 2017; Kortelainen et al., 2018) with air 
quality, health impacts and climate (IPCC, 2013; Janssen et al., 2011; 
Lelieveld et al., 2015; Timonen et al., 2019). Primary particles are 
produced during the burning process while secondary aerosol is pro­
duced as gaseous emissions partition to the particulate phase due to 
oxidation of precursor gases during atmospheric processing (Kroll and 
Seinfeld, 2008; Jimenez et al., 2009). The aerosol between primary and 
atmospherically aged aerosols is called fresh exhaust or fresh flue gas 
(R¨onkk¨o et al., 2017). In fresh exhaust aerosol, the exhaust/flue gas has 
cooled to ambient temperatures and a significant part of semi volatile 
exhaust compounds have condensed or nucleated into the particulate 
phase. Many studies have investigated primary and fresh particulate 
emissions and their influence to urban air quality by direct sampling 
from the hot emission gases in the biomass burning plumes (e.g. Tissari 
et al., 2008; Cubison et al., 2011; Hennigan et al., 2011; Maasikmets 
et al., 2016). Primary and fresh particulate emissions from biomass 
burning mostly consist of carbonaceous matter (organic and black

carbon), as well as some inorganic ions (chloride, sulphate) and metals 
(e.g. K, Na, Zn, Fe) (Kortelainen et al., 2018; Chandrasekaran et al., 
2012). Secondary PM formation from gaseous precursors originating 
from biomass burning can be studied using oxidation flow reactors 
(OFR) (e.g. Kang et al., 2007; Lambe et al., 2015; Simonen et al., 2017; 
Ihalainen et al., 2019). Results from previous studies have revealed a 
great range, varying from a high level of SOA production to very little or 
no SOA production, in the generation of secondary organic aerosol 
(SOA) from biomass burning (e.g. Cubison et al., 2011; DeCarlo et al., 
2010; Ortega et al., 2015). 
It is estimated that globally 1 to 2 billion metric tons of municipal 
solid waste (MSW), i.e., household wastes such as organic waste, card­
board and plastic packaging as well as waste from industrial, institu­
tional and commercial sources, are produced yearly (Wiedinmyer et al., 
2014). Although the small-scale waste burning in households is mostly 
banned, still a large percentage of households (e.g. in Finland >40%, 
(Ohtonen et al., 2018), in Estonia >30% irregularly and around 2% 
regularly (Maasikmets, 2019)) burn waste, such as cardboard, newspa­
pers, cartons etc, along wood. In households, MSW is often burned along 
with wood to get rid of waste, to help in ignition or simply to reduce fuel 
costs. In developing countries, with poor waste disposal systems, MSW 
may also be burned in open, uncontrolled fires (Meallem et al., 2010; 
Stockwell et al., 2016; Rivellini et al., 2017; Jayarathne et al., 2018). 
Residential waste burning can significantly contribute to air pollutant 
concentrations near emission sources but also to the air quality of larger 
areas. For instance, in urban air, organic aerosol originated from plastic 
burning has been found during cold season in Estonia (Maasikmets et al., 
2015). In the study of Argyropoulos et al. (2012), waste burning was 
contributing on average 7.8–14.3% (cold season) and 3.3–10.2% (warm 
season) to the ambient PM10 at two studied sites located in the Rhodes 
Island, Greece. 
The combustion of wood in households causes adverse effects for 
human health and even mortality and morbidity (e.g. Forouzanfar et al., 
2015; Muala et al., 2015; Lim et al., 2010). The toxicity of combustion 
aerosol depends on various factors related e.g. to combustion condition, 
fuel quality, particle composition (e.g. Jalava et al., 2012; Kasurinen 
et al., 2016). The release of potentially toxic compounds, e.g. polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been observed to increase, depend­
ing on the waste type (Jayarathne et al., 2018; Hoffer et al., 2020). 
Wagner and Cabarello (1997) studied the combustion of rubber and 
plastic-type materials and found highly toxic gases such as hydrocyanic 
acid, sulphur dioxide, and hydrogen chloride in emitted compounds. In 
their study, more than 92% of the particulate mass was found to be in the 
respirable range, and toxic heavy metals such as lead, chromium, and 
antimony emissions were also detected in particles. Also, Hedman et al. 
(2006) identified a variety of different toxic compounds, including e.g. 
polychlorinated dibenzodioxins/dibenzofurans (PCDD/F’s) in emitted 
smoke for the combustion of MSW in stoves. These toxic compounds 
from waste burning may cause health risks if humans are exposed to the 
emitted compounds (e.g. Menezes-Filho et al., 2012; Gangwar et al., 
2019). 
The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of household 
waste combustion along with wood on the physical and chemical 
properties of particulate emissions. A masonry heater was used to burn 
the wood and MSW and a comprehensive set of instruments was used to 
measure physical and chemical properties of particles, including 
detailed chemical composition, number- and mass concentrations, as 
well as lung deposited surface areas (LDSA), number and mass size 
distributions of PM, during the burning process in the flue gas. 
2. Experimental 
2.1. Measurement and dilution setup 
The experiments were conducted at the Estonian Environmental 
Research Centre (EERC) fireplace test facility in Tallinn, Estonia. The 
fireplace was a masonry heater constructed to closely resemble fireplace 
built according to the standard EN 15544. The measurement setup is 
shown in Fig. 1. The flue gas sample was taken from the back of the 
heater from the base of the chimney, i.e., relatively close to the com­
bustion process. The flue gas sample was first diluted using an ejector 
(Dekati Ltd, Finland) diluter, followed by pair of secondary diluters. A 
set of instruments measuring gaseous and particulate emission were 
placed after the other double ejector system. In addition, another ejector 
diluter after the PAM was used to dilute the flue gas sample further to 
concentrations suitable for the aerosol instruments. The average dilution 
ratio was 108 after the double ejectors and 2099 after the PAM (i.e. last 
ejector dilutor). A detailed description of dilution setup and dilution 
ration calculations is given in Supplemental material. The CO concen­
tration of the sample was measured before the PAM chamber with a 
Fourier transform infra-red analyzer (FTIR, Gasmet) and after the PAM 
with Environnement S.A, CO12M analyzer). The CO concentrations 
were used to calculate the OH-exposure of the sample. 
Two Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor (ELPI) units were used in this 
study: a classic ELPI (cELPI; Keskinen et al., 1992; Marjam¨aki et al., 
2000) and ELPI+ (J¨arvinen et al., 2014). Both devices share the same 
operating principle. Shortly, ELPI devices charge the measured particles 
in a diffusion charger and then classify the particles according to their 
aerodynamic size in a cascade impactor. The electrical current imparted 
by the collected particles in the impactor stages are measured with 1 s 
time resolution. The current data can then be converted to various 
particle size distributions. In this study, ELPI+ was used to determine 
particle number size distribution, mass size distribution and LDSA size 
distribution. The LDSA size distribution was calculated by using 
stage-specific conversion factors presented in Lepist¨o et al. (2020). The 
cELPI unit was used to monitor particle mass concentration after the 
PAM chamber. The cELPI was modified with an additional stage 
(Yli-Ojanper¨a et al., 2010) and a filter-stage (Marjam¨aki et al., 2002) to 
nearly resemble the ELPI + impactor configuration. Data from impactor 
stages that received less than 0.5% of the total current after secondary 
collection corrections were ignored. A previous article from this 
campaign compared instruments for particle mass measurements (Salo 
et al., 2019). 
A Soot-particle Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (SP-AMS, Aerodyne 
Research Inc, US) was used to gain information on the real time chem­
ical composition of submicron non-refractory PM (sulphate, ammonium, 
nitrate, chloride, organics), refractory organics and refractory BC (rBC) 
and some metals (Onasch et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015). The SP-AMS 
contains a standard tungsten vaporiser and a Nd:YAG laser vaporiser 
(1064 mm), which allows the SP-AMS to measure refractory PM that

vaporises above the tungsten vaporiser temperature (600 ◦C). The 
measured particle size range of the SP-AMS is limited by the aero­
dynamic lens, which transmission efficiency is over 50% for particles 
with vacuum aerodynamic diameter between approximately 50-700 nm 
(Liu et al., 2007). 
The SP-AMS data was analysed using AMS software (SQUIRREL 1.60 
and PIKA v1.20) with Igor Pro 6.37 (WaveMetrics, OR). Collection ef­
ficiency (CE), calculated based on the Middlebrook et al. (2012), was 
between 0.5 and 1. In general, CE was 0.5, which was therefore used for 
all data points. A CO2 correction for the SP-AMS data was done as there 
was relatively large variation in CO2 concentration. 
A Potential Aerosol Mass (PAM) chamber (Aerodyne Research Inc, 
US, Kang et al., 2007; Kang et al., 2011) was used to simulate the at­
mospheric aging of the flue gas. The PAM chamber is a small flow 
through chamber with two UV lamps to produce UV radiation (λ = 185, 
254) and high oxidant (O3, OH and HO2) concentrations (100–1000 
times tropospheric values). The ratios of OH/O3 and HO2/OH are similar 
to tropospheric values and the PAM chamber is shown to simulate well 
atmospheric conditions (Kang et al., 2007; Lambe et al., 2011, 2015). 
The flow through the PAM chamber was 9 L min−1, which was divided to 
central flow (7.5 L min−1) and ring flow (1.5 L min−1). The latter one 
was used to reduce interactions with the walls, and it was discarded. At 
the flow rate of 9 L min−1, the calculated average residence time in the 
PAM chamber was 88 s. The set voltage of the PAM chamber lamps was 
2.5 V, the average temperature and relative humidity (RH) were 25.8 ±
1.7 ◦C and 24.2 ± 1.4%, respectively. The loss and OH-exposure cal­
culations described in supplemental material. 
2.2. Burning experiments 
During the measurement campaign a total of five burning experi­
ments were conducted (Table 1). Each burning experiment typically 
lasted for 60–90 min. The fireplace was allowed to cool between each 
experiment for at least an hour and for the cooling blower at the top of 
the chimney was used. The burned material was either pure dry wood 
(alder and spruce, less than 20% humidity) or wood with added MSW 
(Table 1). MSW was present at the ignition and it was added simulta­
neously with wood during the additions. The MSW consisted of a typical 
household waste, excluding any chemical/paint/glue containers 
(Table 2). The percentages of each waste fraction were based on the 
Estonian municipal solid waste sorting study (SEI, 2013). Waste mate­
rials were not shredded before the combustion and were packed into a 
light-weight plastic bag to ensure that every bag had a similar variety of 
materials to represent each material group chosen for the experiments 
from the MSW sorting study. 
Burning conditions were categorized to four phases called: ignition, 
burning, addition and end burning. The ignition phase began by lighting 
kindling (small sticks of the wood) placed on top of the logs. The chosen 
‘top down’ ignition method was used as it should prevent the smoul­
dering at the beginning of the experiment. The ignition was made with 
5–8 kg batches of dry wood logs (Table 1), which were dried in a room 
temperature conditions and weighted before use. In experiments 4–5 the 
wood was ignited with MSW. 
Burning phase was the phase after ignition when most of the fuel was 
in visible flames and the temperature in the fireplace had increased. The 
burning phase is the optimum operating condition for the masonry 
heater with a high temperature and adequate oxygen feed to the com­
bustion. During burning phase, temperatures reached in combustion 
chamber an average of 425 ◦C and occasionally a peak temperatures up 
to 649 ◦C were observed. Next batch of fuel was added after most of the 
previous fuel had burned until embers. Third phase of the experiment 
was the addition of the fuel. The stage from last addition to end of 
experiment was called end burning. The fireplace was allowed to cool 
between each experiment for at least an hour. A blower situated at the 
top of the chimney was used to keep the gas velocity constant (~2 m s−1) 
and to aid the cooling of the masonry heater. At the beginning of each 
experiment, temperature at the masonry heater was between 20 and 
130 ◦C, depending on the cycle. The effect of fireplace’s temperature, at 
the beginning of cycle, was estimated to have minor influence on flue 
gas emissions. Tables S1 and S2 contains a summary of measurement 
points, used fuels and different burning conditions as well as average 
gaseous and particulate emissions during different phases. 
The gaseous emissions, CO, NOx, were relatively similar between all 
cycles (NOx 0.63–0.97 g/kgCO2, CO 11.3–18.6 g/kgCO2) and no major 
changes in emission levels were observed due to addition of MSW. The 
temperature of the combustion was relatively low and, thus the NOx 
emissions are most probably originated from the fuel. The highest CO 
emission factors were measured in the burning end phase for both wood 
and wood + MSW combustion. Average modified combustion effi­
ciencies (MCE’s, table S1) were similar for all cycles (0.97–0.98) for the 
flaming-dominated burning (Pokhrel et al., 2021), however the MCE’s 
were between 0.92 and 0.93 in the burning end phase of wood + MSW 
combustion but between 0.93 and 0.95 in the burning end phase of 
wood combustion. 
We note that the fireplace used in the study is a fireplace commonly 
used in the Nordic households and wood burning is a common practice. 
Waste mixture was chosen to represent commonly burned trash. Thus, 
the results are generalizable to freshly emitted household combustion 
emission, but, however, not to waste burning plants or open fires in 
ambient conditions and waste dumping sites. We note that the com­
busted waste, and combustion conditions may have a large influence on 
emissions. Also, in the atmosphere emitted flue gas is diluted, cooled, 
mixed with ambient pollution and transformed during the aging process. 
Our results represent both fresh emissions and secondary aerosol for­
mation potential of emissions during aging.

particulate emissions were conducted. In three experiments, the fuel was 
wood (cycles 1–3) and in two experiments fuel was a mixture of wood 
and municipal solid waste (wood + MSW, cycles 4–5). To study the 
temporal behaviour of emissions and the influence of MSW on particle 
number (PN) concentrations and size distributions, two of the cycles 
(cycle 3 wood as fuel and cycle 5 wood + MSW) were chosen for more 
detailed timeseries analysis as they had continuous fresh PN measure­
ments during the whole cycle. 
Fig. 2 shows the particle number size distribution in fresh flue gas as 
a function of time for wood (upper panel) and wood and MSW burning 
(lower panel). Timeseries for other cycles are shown in supplemental 
material (Fig. S1-3). In all cycles, the ignition of the fuel produced a 
burst of small particles with particle diameters between 10 and 100 nm. 
After approximately 5 min from the beginning, i.e., when the fuel started 
to burn efficiently, a relatively stable particle mode between aero­
dynamic diameters of 80 and 300 nm and with mean particle size around 
150 nm was observed. During the fuel additions, high concentrations of 
small particles with diameters 10–100 nm appeared again in the particle 
number size distribution. However, this phenomenon was short lasting, 
and more significant change in the particle size distributions was seen in 
larger particles; the addition of fuel significantly increased their con­
centrations for 3–5 min, mostly in particle sizes larger than 80 nm. Note 
that during the fuel additions, the upper part of the particle number size 
distributions clearly reached even micrometer size. At the end of the 
burning cycles, the mean particle size decreased gradually, and con­
centrations decreased in all particle sizes. Similar particle size distri­
butions from wood combustion, in the size range100-200nm (the mode 
with the highest concentration) has been reported by Tiwari et al. 
(2014). Kortelainen et al. (2015) measured the geometric mean diam­
eter of particles from wood combustion varying between 40 and 150 
depending on the burning phase and wood species. Hosseini et al. (2010) 
reported smaller particle sizes from the combustion of different wood 
types in laboratory conditions with the mode at around 30–50 nm for 
mixed state combustion (small flames and smouldering) and concen­
trations decreasing sharply after 200 nm. Similarly, to this study num­
ber, surface area and mass concentrations peaked at ignition and after 
new patch addition in measurements by Kortelainen et al. (2015) and 
Hosseini et al. (2010) also reported a significant reduction of particle 
number concentrations as burning proceeded. 
Although the temporal behaviour for both fuels were similar, fuel 
clearly affected the observed PN concentration levels. In the wood 
burning, the mean PN concentration, corrected by dilution ratios, was 
approximately 4.2 × 107 cm−3 and in the combination of wood and 
MSW burning it was 12% higher (4.7 × 107 cm−3) (Table 3). Increase of 
particulate emissions due to the burning of MSW with wood can be also 
observed from measured flue gas mean PM1 and PM2.5 particle mass 
(81–100% increase) and LDSA (56% increase) concentrations (Table 3). 
In general, particle number and mass concentration levels for wood 
combustion were relatively similar as observed in previous studies (e.g. 
Kortelainen et al., 2018). Previous studies have shown that both the fuel 
and combustion conditions has significant impact on emissions (Tissari 
et al., 2008; Kortelainen et al., 2018). Likely in this study the change in 
fuel from wood to wood + MSW, changed both the fuel and the com­
bustion conditions and thus caused increase in emission levels. Inline 
with our results, Hoffer et al. (2020) observed 1 to 38 times higher PM10 
emission for waste combustion, depending on burned waste, when 
compared to wood combustion. Also, Jayarathne et al. (2018) observed 
significantly higher PM2.5 emission factor for damp garbage than dry 
garbage (dry garbage EFPM2.5 7.4 g/kg, damp garbage EFPM2.5 125 
g/kg). 
3.2. Influence of MSW to LDSA size distributions 
Fig. 3 and supplement Figs. S4-7 show the LDSA size distributions for 
the wood and wood + MSW burning in different phases (ignition, 
burning, addition, burning end) of cycle 5 (Fig. 3) and cycles 1–4 (Fig 
S4-7). Table S3 summarizes the average LDSA concentrations calculated 
per kg (CO2) and geometric mean particle sizes (Da) of LDSA size dis­
tributions for different cycle phases. In general, the CO2 normalized 
LDSA concentrations were slightly lower (2.4–5.4 × 1012 μm2/kgCO2) for 
wood burning than for wood and MSW burning (2.2–6.4 × 1012 μm2/ 
kgCO2). The mean Da for wood combustion was 0.19 μm (cycles 1–3) and 
0.24 μm for wood + MSW combustion (cycles 4–5). The lowest particle 
sizes were seen during wood ignition (0.11-0-13 μm) and end burning 
(0.17–0.19 μm). In contrast, the largest mean aerodynamic particle sizes 
were seen during wood and MSW additions (0.26–0.31 μm). As the 
largest change in emissions for both PN and LDSA was observed during 
fuel additions, these periods were chosen for further examination 
(chapter 3.3.). 
Although, the recent scientific literature reports LDSA concentra­
tions and emission factors e.g. for traffic and ambient air (e.g. Kuulu­
vainen et al., 2016; J¨arvinen et al., 2019; Cheristanidis et al., 2020), 
information about LDSA concentrations and size distributions from 
wood or Wood + MSW combustion are scarce. Kortelainen et al. (2018) 
published average surface area concentrations measured with NSAM 
(Nanoparticle Surface Area Monitor) for birch combustion (1.6 × 106 
μm2 cm−3) and for spruce combustion (8.7 × 105 μm2 cm−3). Similarly,

wood burning (cycle 3, upper panel) and wood + MSW burning (cycle 5, lower

fuel additions at 16:15 and 16:37 and burning end 16:49–17:08.

to our study, they observed highest surface area concentrations during 
the batch additions. It has been previously seen that changes in LDSA 
concentration may affect to various health parameters, e.g. lung func­
tion (Patel et al., 2018). 
3.3. Influence of MSW to flue gas particle size distributions during fuel 
additions 
Fig. 4 shows the particle size distributions for number, LDSA and 
mass concentrations of the fresh aerosol during the Wood and Wood +
MSW addition phases. The results of other measured additions are 
shown in Fig. S8. 
The observed number, LDSA, and mass concentrations in all the size 
distributions were significantly higher in the wood + MSW addition 
(dashed line) when compared to wood addition. Differences were seen 
also in particle sizes; the geometric mean particle diameters were 109 
nm for the number size distribution, 261 nm for the LDSA size distri­
bution and 491 nm for the mass size distribution during the first addition 
of wood + MSW and, respectively, in the first addition of wood those 
were 84 nm (number), 223 nm (LDSA) and 408 nm (mass). This 
behaviour was repeatable which can be seen as highly similar size dis­
tributions during the second fuel addition (Fig. 3b). 
All particle size distributions presented in Fig. 4 covered large par­
ticle size range. Regarding particle number, the highest concentrations 
were in approximately 100 nm, but the tail of the distribution continued 
down to 10 nm and, on the other hand, up to 500 nm. MSW additions 
increased the observed particle number concentrations but it did not 
affect much the shape of the number size distributions. The LDSA size 
distributions covered the whole fine particle size range, i.e., particle 
sizes smaller than 2.5 μm. It is important to notice that the MSW caused

a significant change also for the shape of LDSA size distribution; while 
the LDSA size distribution was nearly one-modal in case of wood addi­
tions, during wood + MSW additions it was clearly bimodal. The second 
mode appeared in 200–1000 nm particle sizes. This was seen also in the 
mean particle sizes of LDSA mentioned above (Table S3). The measured 
particle mass size distributions covered sizes from 100 nm to the sizes 
significantly above 1 μm. The particle mass size distributions related to 
wood burning had nearly one-modal shape, with relatively weak 
“shoulder” in sizes above 1 μm. In case of MSW addition, this “shoulder” 
increased and formed a major part of the size distribution. To our 
knowledge, LDSA size distributions for wood and MSW combustion has 
not been published in peer-reviewed literature. Similar bimodal LDSA 
size distribution, with median sizes between 190 and 410 nm, has been 
observed by Salo et al. (2021) during a long-range pollution event in 
Helsinki and in the highly polluted Delhi-National Capital Region. Inline 
with our results, Kuuluvainen et al. (2016) observed that the ambient 
LDSA size distribution maximum was around 100 nm for traffic influ­
enced areas and around 200 nm in measurements conducted in resi­
dential areas. The inhalation, toxicity and thus health impacts of 
particles are strongly connected to both the average size and the surface 
area and thus it is very important to measure the particle size distribu­
tion and LDSA in addition to PM concentration in order to enhance the 
understanding of how particles impact our health. 
3.4. Influence of MSW to particle composition 
Fig. 5 presents the average composition of submicron particles for 
each phase measured during cycles 1–5 (upper panel) and the contri­
bution (%) of the major chemical constituents (lower panel) measured 
with the SP-AMS. The PAM chamber was used to simulate the secondary 
aerosol formation potential, i.e., the effects of atmospheric ageing on 
mass concentrations and composition of emitted aerosol. Phases where 
the PAM chamber has been used are marked to figure with the text 
‘PAM’ and phases where wood + MSW were burned marked with 
‘MSW’. 
In general, the main components of submicron PM in flue gas were 
organics and rBC (Fig. 4). When compared to wood, the wood + MSW 
combustion clearly increased rBC concentration (65%) and slightly 
decreased the concentration of organic compounds (26%). Similar PM 
composition for wood combustion has been observed e.g. by Frey et al. 
(2009) and Kortelainen et al. (2018). However, in this study large var­
iations were observed between different burning phases but the PM 
concentrations were quite similar between the cycles. 
During the ignition periods the major particulate components were 
organic compounds (20%) and refractive black carbon (rBC, 78%), 
together representing on average 99% of mass. Ignition of wood + MSW 
mixture did not cause significant increases to the emissions of the main 
components or the composition of PM during ignition. In the case of 
aged emissions (after the PAM chamber) the contribution of organics 
increased (50%), but in general secondary PM emissions were on the 
same level during ignition as the primary emissions, indicating that 
secondary aerosol formation was not significant during ignition. 
During the burning phases, large variation in submicron PM emis­
sions was observed, however, the primary emissions for wood and wood 
+ MSW were quite similar from the particle composition perspective and 
in general the concentrations of fresh emissions were slightly lower than 
during ignition period (Fig. 4). During the burning, organics and rBC 
were the main contributors to PM mass, however the contribution of 
inorganic compounds to submicron particulate mass slightly increased 
but still remained at low level. Similar to burning, large variation in 
submicron PM emissions was observed for burning end phases. The 
chemical composition measurement showed that the contribution of 
organics was larger during burning end phase than during the burning 
phase. The aging of flue gases in the PAM chamber increased the mass of

particulate organics, both for wood burning and wood + MSW burning. 
Similarly, as was observed for size distributions, the MSW had a 
major influence on concentration and composition of submicron par­
ticulate emissions during fuel additions. Significant increase was seen 
both in rBC (275% increase) and organic concentrations (20% increase) 
of fresh flue gas and in organic concentration of flue gas treated by PAM 
chamber. 
BC forms in incomplete combustion and observed increase in BC 
emission indicates that MSW changed the combustion conditions. Frey 
et al. observed over 50% increase in EC when combustion conditions 
were changed from good to smoldering combustion. 
Inline with our results, Stockwell et al. (2016), observed higher BC 
emission factors for emissions of mixed waste burning from open fires 
compared to other fuels. Also, previous studies have indicated that 
organic fraction from waste combustion typically contains for example 
PAH and BTEX compounds (e.g. Stockwell et al., 2016; Hoffer et al., 
2020) that are known to be detrimental for health (Schwarze et al., 
2006) and therefore, the change in composition by MSW combustion is 
rather concerning. 
Related to wood burning, the mean ratios of organic to rBC were on 
average between 0.27 and 4.48 depending on the burning phase and 
aging. The MSW addition was not observed to have systematic influence 
on organic to rBC -ratios. Fig. S9 shows the organic to rBC -ratios for 
each phase in each cycle. Observed ratios are lower than in Grieshop 
et al. (2009) who found organic to BC ratios ranging from 1.1 to 13 for 
fresh wood combustion emissions. Our results were also smaller when 
compared to ratios observed for flex-fuel vehicles (0.9–3.1 (Timonen 
et al., 2017);) or in the atmosphere (1.5–20; (Aurela et al., 2011). In 
general, the PAM enhancement ratios (ER) were relatively low (1.7–3), 
as typically observed for wood combustion (Ortega et al., 2013). 
3.5. Trace metal emissions during the fuel additions 
Fig. 6 shows the “wood + MSW combustion to wood combustion” 
-ratio for different trace metals and their salts (Al, Cd, Fe, Nb, Rh, Sb, Zn, 
HCl, KCl, NaCl) during the different burning phases. 
For wood burning the trace metal emissions were relatively low, but 
significant increase (on average 3.3–179 -fold increase over cycle) was 
seen when MSW was added along the wood. High ratios were observed 
especially during fuel addition phases but, depending on compounds, 
also during ignition and burning end phases (Fig. 6). The highest ratios 
were observed for chloride compounds (HCl, KCl, NaCl). Potassium and 
chlorine content in the wood varies between different wood species and 
the geographical location of the trees (Shah et al., 2010; Jenkins et al., 
1998). When wood is combusted, potassium, sodium and chloride are 
released from the fuel (Sorvaj¨arvi et al., 2014). They form potassium 
chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl) in the gas phase both of 
which can cause corrosion in fireplaces (Skrifvars et al., 2008). The KCl 
release from wood combustion and water in the gas phase react together 
releasing HCl (Lehmusto et al., 2019). Kortelainen et al. (2018) also 
observed Cl, Zn, Na, Fe and K emissions when burning spruce, beech and 
birch. The elevated chloride compound concentrations during MSW 
burning indicate that either the MSW also released additional chloride 
compounds to flue gas or changed the chemistry to favor gas-to-particle 
phase change of chloride compounds. Elevated ambient chloride com­
pounds from combustion of biomass and likely mixed waste are typically 
observed in polluted areas such as India (Gani et al., 2019; Gunthe et al., 
2021). Gunthe et al. (2021) found that highly water-absorbing and 
soluble chloride in the aqueous phase substantially enhances aerosol 
water uptake through co-condensation, which sustains particle growth 
and leads to haze and fog formation. Their results suggest that the high 
local concentration of gas-phase hydrochloric acid causes some 50% of 
the reduced visibility. 
In addition to chloride compounds, we observed elevated concen­
trations of a variety of other metals (Al, Cd, Fe, Nb, Rh, Sb, Zn) in flue gas 
when MSW was burned. Many of metals observed in this study (e.g. Al, 
Fe, Cd, K) are also found naturally in wood and bark (Chandrasekaran 
et al., 2012). However, the higher concentrations observed for MSW 
burning indicate that the origin of these metals is likely MSW materials, 
including e.g. paints, foil-coatings, additives, stabilizers, fire retardants 
and color pigments used in variable roles and concentrations in card­
board, wood, textiles and plastic products. Trace metals, such as anti­
mony, have been proposed as a tracers for waste combustion. Christian 
et al. (2010) measured metal emissions from variety of sources (e.g. 
indoor open wood cooking fires, charcoal and brick making kilns, 
garbage burns in peri-urban landfills and barley stubble field burns) in 
Mexico. They observed over 300 times higher antimony emissions for 
garbage burning than for crop burning. Also, Jayarathne et al. (2018) 
observed that garbage burning emissions from open fires contained 
relatively high concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Sb). Our results 
for antimony, showing significant increase especially during ignition 
and fuel additions, are in line with the previous results and further 
confirm that the antimony could be a good tracer for MSW combustion 
emissions. 
Metals in wood combustion derived aerosols have known effects for 
toxicity (e.g. Uski et al., 2015; Kocbach Bolling et al., 2009) and 
therefore, it may be anticipated that MSW burning is increasing those 
effects due to larger concentrations. 
4. Conclusions 
Although it is mostly forbidden, household waste is often burned 
with wood to reduce the cost of heating and to dispose the waste, even in 
developed countries. In this study, wood and wood mixed with house­
hold waste were burnt in a masonry heater to characterize the influence 
of waste combustion to particulate emissions in the flue gas. Household 
waste combustion along with wood in a stove appliance commonly used 
in the households was observed to increase the particulate emissions. 
The most pronounced effects were seen during the fuel addition periods, 
when the concentrations of PN, PM, BC and LDSA increased and mean 
particle size increased. Especially, the increased metal concentrations 
combined with increased lung deposition surface area indicate that 
waste burning could potentially have influences to human health. 
Furthermore, the increase in chloride emissions due to MSW burning 
will likely have negative impact to condition of burning device due to 
corrosion. The increase of particulate emissions will likely affect the air 
quality in nearby areas and houses. In addition, both the BC and metals 
absorb light and thus warm climate and change the albedo of snow and 
ice surfaces causing melting.

Various combustion processes occur concurrently during biomass burning events, emitting a complex mixture of
particulate and gaseous pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions undergo chemical transformations facili-
tated by factors such as solar radiation and cloud formation, thereby altering the composition of aerosols. Addi-
tionally, these pollutants can affect the region of origin and neighboring countries, presenting regional and global
environmental challenges. Therefore, precise evaluation of the particulate and gaseous pollutants emitted during
biomass burning is essential to formulate effective management strategies. This study aimed to assess the concen-
tration and chemical characteristics of particulate matter emitted during biomass burning in South Korea. On June 7,
2021, a research flight was conducted utilizing a High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-
ToF-AMS) and a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) for airborne measurements over South Korea inland areas.
For data analysis based on administrative regions, the flight path was divided into four major areas (Areas A, B, C,
and D). During the research flight, evidence of biomass burning events was observed primarily in Area C. A positive
matrix factorization (PMF) analysis categorized the organic aerosols (OA) into five factors: biomass burning OA
(BBOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA1, HOA2), low-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA), and more-oxidized OOA
(MO-OOA). Across all areas, MO-OOA accounted for the highest proportion of aerosols, whereas BBOA dominated in
Area C at 23.8%, indicating the significant influence of biomass burning in this region. Instead of running a PMF
analysis with all measurement data, a BBOA formula was derived from the previous study and this one. This allows
us to estimate BBOA concentration without running PMF.

1. Introduction
Biomass burning encompasses the combustion of organic materials,
including wood, sawdust, and agricultural by-products, as well as nat-
ural and human-induced fires (Krecl et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023). This
process generates ultrafine particulate matter (UFPM) composed of
particles <1 μm in diameter, posing significant health risks (Krecl et al.,
2023). UFPM can infiltrate the alveoli upon inhalation, leading to res-
piratory and cardiovascular ailments, and increasing the likelihood of
cancer and premature mortality (Krecl et al., 2023; Longhin et al.,
2016).
During biomass burning, various combustion types occur concur-
rently, releasing a multitude of particulate and gaseous pollutants into
the
atmosphere.
These
pollutants
may
undergo
chemical
trans-
formations facilitated by meteorological processes such as solar radia-
tion and cloud formation. Moreover, due to long-distance transport, they
can impact climate conditions in both the originating region and
neighboring countries, presenting significant regional and global envi-
ronmental concerns (Axt et al., 2023; Farley et al., 2022; Fernandez
et al., 2001; Longhin et al., 2016; Samae et al., 2021; Yin, 2023).
Although biomass burning stemming from natural events such as
wildfires and volcanic eruptions cannot be prevented or managed via
supervision and regulation, controlling the release of air pollutants from
illegal incineration of wood fuel, domestic waste, and agricultural by-
products constituting over 80% of domestic biomass burning can be
achieved via legal and regulatory measures (National Air Emission In-
ventory and Research Center, 2023). Nonetheless, effectively managing
and supervising these illegal incineration activities, particularly in
small-scale settings such as fields, campfires at camping sites, and
household wood stoves in rural areas, presents practical challenges.
Notably, outdoor incineration of agricultural by-products for pest con-
trol in farmland remains prevalent, releasing air pollutants that can
adversely affect air quality and human health in the impacted area and
surrounding regions (Oh et al., 2020).
Currently, the practice of biomass burning for agricultural by-
product disposal is prohibited, prompting local governments to devise
alternative collection plans for such materials. However, illegal biomass
burning of agricultural by-products remains prevalent in rural areas.
Research is imperative to examine the types and concentration levels of
particulate matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants emitted during these
illegal activities. To address this, chamber-based studies have been
conducted for various agricultural by-products (Levin et al., 2010;
Ortega et al., 2013; Pan et al., 2017). Nevertheless, conducting real-time
measurements at actual burning sites poses challenges due to the un-
predictable and simultaneous nature of these events in random
locations.
Therefore, airborne measurements offer a more suitable approach
compared to ground-based measurements at fixed points, as they allow
for monitoring air pollution while in motion (Johnson et al., 2008;
Sullivan et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2023). This study leveraged airborne
measurements to observe biomass burning events in agricultural areas,
benefiting from direct access to burning sites. The emissions of PM from
illegal biomass burning introduce complexities in identifying PM con-
centration and chemical properties in the area, thereby complicating the
establishment of effective PM reduction policies.
Hence, airborne measurement data were utilized to 1) identify
biomass burning markers, 2) investigate the impact of biomass burning
on areas with elevated PM concentrations using positive matrix factor-
ization (PMF) analysis, and 3) determine the primary materials involved
in biomass burning by comparing measurement data with PMF results.
2. Methodology
2.1. Research site and flight height
A research aircraft, the Beechcraft 1900D, owned and operated by
Hanseo University, was utilized for the research flight. The takeoff and
landing occurred at Hanseo University’s Taean Airfield, which has
served as the primary airfield for airborne measurements since the
introduction of the Beechcraft 1900D in Korea in 2019. Taean Airfield
offers essential facilities such as aircraft fueling systems and hangars,
making it well-suited for research flights.
On June 7, 2021, the research flight was conducted along an inland
circulation path to measure biomass burning events. The flight duration
lasted approximately 3.5 h, with the flight path divided into four distinct
areas: the northside and southside of Chungcheongnam-do (Areas A and
B, respectively), the Honam Plain (Area C), and the vicinity of Gwangju
(Area D) (Table 1). These areas were delineated based on administrative
districts, with Areas A, B, and D characterized as industrial complexes,
whereas Area C represented an agricultural region (Kim et al., 2021).
Area C, known as Korea’s breadbasket, boasts a cultivation area of
approximately 185,000 ha, covering approximately 50 km in width and
80 km in length. Rice and barley are the primary agricultural products
cultivated in this region, with barley cultivated in winter and harvested
in spring. Area C typically undergoes double-cropping annually, with
rice cultivation following barley harvest. Biomass burning events
frequently occur in Area C after the barley harvest in May and June each
year, primarily to dispose of agricultural by-products such as barley
stalks due to efforts to prevent pest infestations and the absence of
collection systems.
Given that biomass burning events usually occur within the plane-
tary boundary layer height, conducting research flights at low altitudes
is essential to gather data and yield useful results via airborne mea-
surements. Moreover, Korea’s inland topography comprises mountains
of varying elevations, rendering fixed-altitude flights unsuitable for
capturing biomass burning events on the ground surface. Consequently,
the research flight was carried out at the lowest possible altitude above
sea level without adhering to a fixed altitude to capture ground-level
biomass burning cases effectively.
2.2. Sampling inlet
The airborne aerosol inlet (AAI) (Droplet Measurement Technology;
DMT, USA), developed as a result of the DC-8 Inlet Characterization
Experiment (DICE) conducted by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), is a PM sampling inlet affixed to the aircraft. Its
primary objective is to ascertain the transmission efficiency character-
istics of PM during airborne measurements (Fig. S1(a)) (McNaughton
et al., 2007). The AAI can maintain a consistent inhalation flow velocity
of 100 L/min regardless of the aircraft’s speed, rendering it suitable for
capturing UFPM. Importantly, it experiences no particle loss when
dealing with UFPM (McNaughton et al., 2007; Seo et al., 2019).
To prevent any interference with PM measurements, the discharge
tube is installed opposite to the sampling inlet. Additionally, the trace
gas inlet (TGI) is strategically positioned in front of the aircraft engine
outlet to ensure it remains unaffected by engine emissions (Fig. S1(b)).

The TGI utilized was attached to the first window of the Beechcraft
1900D and manufactured by the University of California, Irvine (UCI) in
the United States. Its streamlined design, akin to aircraft wings, mini-
mizes airflow resistance during airborne measurements (Seo et al.,
2019).
Both the AAI and TGI, integrated into airborne measurements, are
products of extensive prior research. They have consistently exhibited
high reliability in sample collection efficiency and performance, having
been utilized in numerous previous studies on airborne measurements
(Mason et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023; Sarkar et al.,
2021).
2.3. Measuring instruments and data analysis
2.3.1. High resolution time-of-flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer
A High Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-
ToF-AMS, Aerodyne Research Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) was utilized to
analyze the characteristics of organics, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium
in non-refractory particulate matter (NR-PM1; Kim et al., 2020; Lee
et al., 2016). To maintain a constant inflow rate of 0.85 LPM, regardless
of altitude, a pressure-controlled inlet (PCI) was installed in front of the
HR-ToF-AMS inlet (Bahreini et al., 2008).
The data collection procedure for the HR-ToF-AMS can be outlined as
follows: ambient atmosphere passing through the critical orifice and the
aerodynamic lens installed within the HR-ToF-AMS forms a narrow
particle beam, retaining particles ranging in size from 35 nm to 1.5 μm.
This particle beam then traverses a chamber of fixed length under a
vacuum of approximately 10−6 Torr. Inside the chamber, a chopper
periodically opens and closes, determining whether the particle beam
reaches the vaporizer. The vaporizer’s surface temperature is main-
tained at approximately 600 ◦C, vaporizing and ionizing beams that
reach it through electron ionization (70 ev). Ionized particles are
directed to either the V or W mode based on ion optic settings. These
particles in motion are detected by the multichannel plate (MCP) de-
tector and converted into digital signals using the analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) (AP240, Acqiris, Geneva, Switzerland; DeCarlo et al.,
2006).
Traditionally, HR-ToF-AMS measurements on the ground are con-
ducted in the standard MS mode, with a resolution of one every 5 min for
sample analysis time. For airborne measurements, the Fast MS (FMS)
mode is employed, enabling measurements at either 1 or 10 Hz. Chal-
lenges arise when aiming for a data resolution of 2 Hz or higher in the
standard MS mode. First, although the adjustment of measurements is
possible in this mode, the chopper’s open/close ratio is typically main-
tained at 1:1, taking hundreds of milliseconds for movement. Data
storage is paused for approximately 100–500 ms to avoid ambiguity
regarding the chopper’s position after movement. Second, reducing the
close time to expedite measurement can lead to low-volatility particles
not volatilized in the closed position, contributing to underestimating
concentrations. To mitigate this, the FMS mode is utilized. It provides
only chopper-open or chopper-close data for each measurement, mini-
mizing data loss compared to the standard MS mode when measure-
ments are conducted every second (Kimmel et al., 2011). When
measuring PM using the HR-ToF-AMS, equipment calibration and
correction procedures were implemented to ensure accurate concen-
tration calculations, in accordance with established methodologies
(Canagaratna et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2012). Assessing the particle
ionization efficiency (IE) of the HR-ToF-AMS is crucial as it can vary
based on the chemical composition of the particles. To ascertain the IE,
ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) particles were generated using an aerosol
generator (3076, TSI Inc., USA), and the IE was determined by selecting
particles of a specific size (e.g., 300 nm) with an electrostatic classifier.

Relative IE values for each chemical component were adopted from a
prior study (organic = 1.4, sulfate = 1.2, nitrate = 1.1, and ammonium
= 4; Alfarra et al., 2004).
The particle collection efficiency in the HR-ToF-AMS is not constant
due to particles bouncing on the vaporizer surface, a phenomenon
influenced by the composition of particles (Huffman et al., 2005;
Matthew et al., 2008). To address this variability, the collection effi-
ciency by particle was adjusted using the composition-dependent
collection efficiency (CDCE) correction method (Middlebrook et al.,
2012). Molar ratios of elements were determined for the calculation of
organic concentrations (e.g., O/C, H/C, and OM/OC) using the
enhanced ambient method (Canagaratna et al., 2015). Further details
regarding the HR-ToF-AMS data analysis method can be found in prior
studies (Aiken et al., 2008, 2009).
For the analysis of HR-ToF-AMS data, SeQUential Igor data
RetRiEval (SQUIRREL) 1.63I and Peak Integration by Key Analysis
(PIKA) 1.23I 16, software programs based on Igor Pro 8.04 (Wave-
metrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA), were utilized (DeCarlo et al., 2008).
PMF analysis was conducted using the PMF2 algorithm in robust mode
and the PMF Evaluation Toolkit (PET version 3.08C) (PMF_Evalua-
tion_Tool_Software, 2023; Zhang et al., 2011; Ulbrich et al., 2009;
Paatero and Tapper, 1994). Five numbers of factors in PMF simulation
were explored by changing fpeak from 1- to 1 (in increment of 0.2). After
analyzing, the optimum solution was selected. These diagnostic plots are
provided in the supplementary information (Fig. S2). Five-factor solu-
tion (Q/Qexp = 0.5; fpeak = 0) was selected for further analysis because
of better separation than another number factor (Figs. S2(a) and (b);
Singh et al., 2019).
2.3.2. Single Particle Soot Photometer
A Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2; DMT), employing the laser-
induced incandescence method, was deployed to analyze the physical
attributes of individual black carbon particles. Using this instrument, we
could ascertain the mass and diameter of each refractory black carbon
(rBC) particle, which becomes incandescent upon reaching its evapo-
ration point after absorbing the laser. Leveraging the laser-induced
incandescence method, the SP2 also enabled the measurement of the
number concentration, mass concentration, particle size distribution,
and mixed condition of rBC particles. Detailed measurement principles
and analysis methods can be found in previous studies (Kang et al.,
2021; Lim et al., 2019; Schwarz et al., 2006; Stephens et al., 2003). In
this study, the incandescent channel of rBC was calibrated using Aqua-
dag (DMT), whereas its scattering channel was calibrated using poly-
styrene latex (PSL; Duke Scientific, USA).

3. Results
3.1. Concentrations of NR-PM1 and rBC in biomass burning events
On June 7, 2021, a research flight was conducted over inland regions
of Korea to evaluate biomass burning occurrences. The flight was
maintained at an average altitude of 571 m, reflecting the lowest feasible
above sea level. No specific altitude was set because biomass burning
predominantly transpires at the ground level (Table 2; Lin et al., 2023).
For data interpretation, the research flight path was segmented into four
areas delineated by administrative districts to evaluate the NR-PM1 and
rBC concentrations in each region, with biomass burning events notably
concentrated in Area C. During the research flight, organics, prevalent in
agricultural residues, exhibited concentrations 1.9 times higher in Area
C than in the three other areas. Additionally, biomass burning indicators
such as K+, C2H4O2
+, and C3H5O2
+ averaged 1.1, 2.8, and 3.5 times
higher, respectively, in Area C than in Areas A, B, and D (Fig. 3; Table 1;
Kang et al., 2020; Garofalo et al., 2019). In instances of biomass burning,
the average rBC concentration in Area C reached 0.89 μg/m3, approxi-
mately 1.9 times higher than the average rBC concentrations in the three
other areas (Areas A, B, and D; Fig. 1; Table 2). Biomass burning of
agricultural residues was observed primarily in Area C, the largest
agricultural expanse in Korea. Among the various air pollutants emitted
during biomass burning, Area C exhibited notably higher concentrations
of organics and rBC than the other regions (Choi et al., 2017).
3.2. Identification of biomass burning markers using the HR-ToF-AMS
data
During airborne measurements, a multitude of smoke plumes were
observed over a broad area rather than a singular plume in Area C (Fig. 2
(a) and (b)). The m/z 60 (f60) signals are generally called tracers for
biomass burning emissions (Hu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). If the f60
percentage is over 0.3%, biomass burning events exist more than at
other sites (Zhang et al., 2018). In the present study, the average f60
percentage was 0.21%–0.28% (Table 3). Even though f60 was not over
0.3% in all the areas, Area C had a higher f60 percentage than another
site at 0.28%. Thus, we can estimate that Area C had more biomass
burning events than the other sites.
Depending on the observed type during biomass burning, smoke
plumes can be classified as either flaming or smoldering. Flaming in-
stances exhibit a robust correlation between organics, emitted during
biomass burning, and K+ among the biomass burning markers.
Conversely, smoldering instances demonstrate a high correlation be-
tween organics and mass fragment m/z 60 (f60, predominantly C2H4O2
+)
among the biomass burning markers (Lee et al., 2010).
A correlation analysis was conducted to discern the type of smoke
plumes emitted during observed biomass burning events in Area C. The
correlations of organics vs. K+ and organics vs. C2H4O2
+ yielded R2
values of 0.29 and 0.93, respectively (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). Organics dis-
played a weak correlation with K+ but a remarkably strong correlation
with C2H4O2
+. This indicates that flaming instances occurring during the
incineration of agricultural residues at ground level were largely
transformed into smoldering instances when the smoke ascended to al-
titudes conducive for airborne measurements. Hence, future assessments
of biomass burning occurrences in domestic regions based on airborne
measurements and HR-ToF-AMS data should consider not only K+ but
also C2H4O2
+ data.
3.3. Characteristics and source apportionment of organic aerosols
Along the inland flight path, organic aerosols (OA) constituted the
predominant fraction of the total NR-PM1 (64% on average). To delve
into the characteristics of OA, PMF analysis was conducted. This
methodology offers the advantage of dissecting individual factors, spe-
cific emission sources, or atmospheric processes by cross-referencing
with external tracers, utilizing derived spectra, temporal variation pat-
terns, and analytical findings. PMF analysis was executed using unit
mass resolution (UMR) and high-resolution mass spectra (HR) within a
2–7 factor range. In this study, the final outcomes comprised five factors,
selected from the UMR and HR datasets at Q/Qexp = 0.5 and FPeak =
0 (Figs. S2(a) and (b)).
According to prior research, there exist significant identifying
markers for each factor. Biomass burning organic aerosols (BBOA)
manifest high values at m/z 60 (predominantly C2H4O2
+) and 73 (pre-
dominantly C3H5O2
+) (Chebaicheb et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2022).
Hydrocarbon-like organic aerosols (HOA) at m/z 57 (mainly C4H9
+),
low-oxidized organic aerosols (LO-OOA) at m/z 43 and m/z 44 (pri-
marily CO2
+), and more-oxidized organic aerosols (MO-OOA) at m/z 44
and m/z (44/43) (Acharja et al., 2022; Farah et al., 2021; Ng et al., 2010;
Ng et al., 2011; Yao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).
Factor 1 is characterized by m/z 29 (C2H5
+), m/z 60 (C2H4O2
+), and
m/z 73 (C3H5O2
+). These components are deemed outcomes of the

+.

fragmentation of levoglucosan and other carbohydrate materials and
can be designated as BBOA due to their alignment with biomass burning
markers (Fig. 4) (Acharja et al., 2022; Bhandari et al., 2022). Correlation
analysis confirmed robust correlations of 0.97 and 0.90 for C2H4O2
+ and
C3H5O2
+ with BBOA (Fig. S3).
The markers typically observed for Factors 2 and 3 include m/z 41
(C3H5
+), 43 (C3H7
+), 55 (C4H7
+), 57 (C4H9
+), 67 (C5H7+), 79 (C6H7
+). Factor
2 exhibited a larger signal of m/z 43 compared to m/z 44. Correlation
analysis revealed correlation coefficients of 0.67 and 0.66 with C5H7
+
and C6H7
+ (Fig. 4) (Kim et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2022; Li et al., 2020).
Consequently, it was classified as HOA1 (Fig. S3) (Acharja et al., 2022;
Zhang et al., 2005). Correlation analysis of Factor 3 with rBC and C4H9
+
yielded coefficient values of 0.65 and 0.85. Thus, Factor 3 was identified
as HOA2 (Fig. S3).
Factors 4 and 5 displayed signals at m/z 18, 28, and 44, characteristic
of OOA. The signals of m/z 43 and 44 were observed for Factor 4,
whereas the m/z 44 signal, indicative of a relatively more oxidized type,
was observed for Factor 5. The m/z (44/43) ratio was calculated to be
2.6 and 16.5 for Factors 4 and 5, respectively (Ng et al., 2010). The O/C
ratio was determined to be higher for Factor 5 (1.51). Hence, Factor 4
was delineated as LO-OOA and Factor 5 as MO-OOA (Fig. 4).
The OA composition ratio for each area was assessed using the PMF
results categorized into the five factors. Across all areas, MO-OOA

exhibited the highest proportion (averaging 35.3%) (Fig. 5). HOA1,
HOA2, and LO-OOA displayed similar proportions in all four areas.
Concerning BBOA, Area C demonstrated the highest proportion (23.8%),
followed by areas D, B, and A, highlighting the significant impact of
biomass burning in Area C compared to the other regions (Table 4).
Thus, based on the PMF outcomes, it is evident that the elevated con-
centrations of organics in Area C are primarily attributable to biomass
burning compared to other areas.
3.4. Derivatization of the BBOA concentration from the slope
Running the PMF is suitable for figuring out the BBOA concentration
in the organics. The PMF analysis results verified biomass burning as a
significant contributor to the heightened levels of organics in Area C.
However, running the PMF with every measurement data is inefficient.
Thus, to obtain the BBOA concentration in the organics, we prepared a
slope from the previous study and this study. We adopted the BBOA
slope results from the second Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment II (Lee
et al., 2010). Our study computed HR-ToF-AMS BBOA values using the
multiple combustion BBOA slope (34.5) against C2H4O2
+ (μg/m3), a key
BBOA marker in HR-ToF-AMS. This enabled comparison and analysis of
the HR-ToF-AMS data with the PMF outcomes. We opted for the multiple
combustion BBOA slope gained from combusting 30 different species of
materials from a previous study (Lee et al., 2010; Sullivan et al., 2008).
We then compared the HR-ToF-AMS BBOA calculation values with the
PMF BBOA results. Comparing the HR-ToF-AMS BBOA calculation
values derived from the multiple combustion BBOA slopes with the PMF
BBOA results yielded a high R2 value of 0.96 and a slope of 0.64 (Fig. 6).
As a result, we derived Formula (1): BBOA = (C2H4O2
+ * 34.5 * 0.64).
With Formula (1), we expect to obtain the accurate BBOA concentration
using the C2H4O2
+ measurement data without running the PMF.
4. Conclusions
Airborne measurements were conducted over inland regions of
Korea on June 7, 2021, utilizing a research aircraft equipped with a HR-
ToF-AMS and an SP2. The objective was to assess the concentration and
chemical properties of PM emitted during domestic biomass burning
events. Data analysis involved dividing the research flight path into four
major areas (Areas A, B, C, and D) based on administrative districts.
Biomass burning sites were detected primarily in Area C during the
flight. The average concentrations of organics and rBC emitted during
combustion were 24.7 and 0.89 μg/m3, respectively. Additionally,
concentrations of biomass burning markers such as K+, C2H4O2
+, and
C3H5O2
+ were measured at 0.043, 0.077, and 0.047 μg/m3, respectively.
Different markers were utilized depending on the type of biomass
burning observed. Analysis of the measurement data revealed a rela-
tively weak correlation with K+ (0.29) but a strong correlation with
C2H4O2
+ (0.93), indicating a prevalence of smoldering biomass burning.
PMF was employed to characterize the organic compounds emitted
during biomass burning, resulting in the identification of five factors:
BBOA, HOA1, HOA2, LO-OOA, and MO-OOA. Subsequently, based on
the PMF results the composition ratio of organics was examined for each
of the four areas. MO-OOA exhibited the highest proportion in all four
areas. However, Area C stood out with the highest proportion of BBOA
(23.8%) underscoring the substantial impact of biomass burning in this
region compared to the others. We obtained a slope BBOA = (C2H4O2
+ *
34.5 * 0.64). We adopted the BBOA slope results from the second Fire
Lab multiple combustion BBOA slope (34.5) and a slope of 0.64 derived
from comparing the calculated HR-ToF-AMS BBOA and PMF BBOA. We
believe this formula helps gain the BBOA concentration without running
the PMF. Our findings underscore the potential for increased concen-
trations of organics during biomass combustion events in Korea. These
elevated organics may contribute to PM formation via photochemical
reactions with gaseous precursors in the atmosphere. Hence, continuous
management and monitoring of these emissions are crucial, given their
potential impact on air quality in both the immediate and neighboring
areas.

ABSTRACT 
 
Open waste burning (OWB) is a common disposal practice in several countries. However, this 
activity can serve as a source of particulate matter and black carbon, which possess a greater 
greenhouse effect potential than CO2. Moreover, particulates can produce chronic health impacts 
on residents around the burning areas. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the 
environmental effects and health risks associated with the open burning of household waste in 
Semarang, Indonesia. Four steps were followed to answer the research questions: (1) data 
collection through a random questionnaire survey, transect walk, and field survey; (2) estimation 
of environmental risk using the IPCC calculation method; (3) multiplication of emission factors to 
determine black carbon emissions; and (4) estimation of health risks based on chemical speciation 
bound to particulate matter. Open burning remained the second most common waste disposal 
practice even after the implementation of waste collection services by the government. Specifically, 
approximately 240.28 tons of waste is not collected by the environmental agency service every 
day, and 88.6% of the uncollected waste in the city is openly burned. Plastic burning contributed to 
the highest emission share among waste components, and annual total emissions due to OWB were 
estimated at approximately 53,809.66 tons. Although the carcinogenic risk was low, non-cancer 
disease risk exceeded the standard. Therefore, direct exposure of residents to OWB may pose 
significant health risks. The present work fills the scientific and knowledge gaps in the OWB studies.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Open waste burning (OWB) is a potential source of emissions in major cities of many low- and 
middle-income countries (Das et al., 2018; Lal et al., 2016; Nagpure et al., 2015). OWB releases 
many hazardous compounds that may pose risks to the public and environment around the 
burning areas (Powrie et al., 2021). OWB is an adverse practice to several sustainable development 
goals (SDGs), such as goal numbers 3 (good health and well-being), 6 (clean water and sanitation),

11 (sustainable cities and communities), and 12 (responsible consumption and production) (Mihai 
et al., 2021). This practice is commonly undertaken in areas that are not covered by waste 
collection services, along with other disposal practices, such as burial or dumping on the open 
ground or water surface (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). Some open dumpsites with diverse waste 
characteristics may be burnt uncontrollably. For instance, a recent study reported that open 
burning at a Nigerian landfill site contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into 
the atmosphere (Daffi et al., 2020). Additionally, according to Sharma et al. (2022), the largest 
contributor of particulate matter (PM) emissions in India may be OWB by 2035 in the case of lack 
of appropriate political intervention. Therefore, these severe threats should be treated appropriately 
to reduce the possibility of other accidents. 
According to Ramadan et al. (2022a), the environmental and health risks of OWB exposure 
have attracted much research attention. OWB emits greenhouse and trace gases, PM, black 
carbon (BC), and other bound compounds (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014). The IPCC 2006 methodologies 
have been extensively used to calculate the environmental impact of OWB practices. However, 
BC is not considered in these calculations and must be quantified using a separate procedure 
(Premakumara et al., 2018). BC produces a greater environmental impact than carbon dioxide or 
methane (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). Furthermore, OWB emissions are more dangerous because 
of their potential to emit hydrocarbons and metal-bound particulates (Chi et al., 2022). In particular, 
a number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can be released during the burning process 
because of the presence of plastic waste that is burned together with other domestic waste 
(Hoffer et al., 2020). PAHs can be released through volatilization and can bind PM (Hubai et al., 
2022; Velis and Cook, 2021). Importantly, some typical heavy metals with carcinogenic risk, such 
as Pb, Ni, and Cd, may be bound to fly ash (FA) generated from 0.01 to 14.16 mg kg–1 of burned 
waste (Park et al., 2013), posing carcinogenic and chronic health risks. 
Several studies have been reported the health effects of the OWB. Velis and Cook (2021) has 
been specifically reviewed about the health risks of open burning of plastic waste. In that study, 
dioxins, and related compounds (DRCs), bisphenol A (BPA), and PAHs were identified during the 
OWB incidents and informal recyclers are susceptible to high risk from direct inhalation and 
ingestion. Shih et al. (2015) estimated that OWB at landfill site increase PCDD/F concentrations 
in the environmental media. Several cancer deaths reported in Nairobi, can be related to the 
dioxin emissions from OWB. However, estimation of the cancer posed by dioxin is differs among 
the populations, uncertainty occurred in the estimation. Kodros et al. (2016) made estimation 
related to the global mortalities to the ambient PM2.5 emissions from OWB. The results interestingly 
showed that the 9% of mortalities from PM2.5 emissions is due to biomass burning. Since it is a 
coarse model estimation, smaller scale of study in regional, national, or city scale is needed to 
reduce the uncertainties of the estimated model. 
In the previous studies, Park et al. (2013) and Hoffer et al. (2020) estimated the potential of 
smoke, heavy metal, and PAH-bound PM emission factor from different type of OWB. In another 
study, Reyna-Bensusan et al. (2019) measured BC emissions from uncontrolled waste burning and 
estimated their effects on global warming potential (GWP). In addition, the emission pattern and 
contribution of OWB practices have been estimated at the national level (Cheng et al., 2020; Pansuk 
et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2022) and city level in some countries (Das et al., 2018; Lal et al., 2016; 
Nagpure et al., 2015; Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). Meanwhile, according to Chaudhary et al. 
(2022), waste burning may be legalized through the use of portable clean air devices as substitutes 
for conventional OWB systems. Recently, Ramadan et al. (2022b) conducted transect walk surveys 
in Semarang during semi-lockdown in rainy seasons. The authors studied CO, CO2, HC, NOx, and total 
particulate matter (TPM) emissions from OWB. The combination of transect walk and questionnaire 
survey is better for making a robust inventory of emissions especially for OWB incidents (Ramadan 
et al., 2022a). In another study, Wiedinmyer et al. (2014) have summarized typical emissions from 
OWB; however, the authors estimated emission factors using old data, due perhaps to the lack of 
availability of data on current OWB practices. Previously, the contribution of OWB to GWP has only 
been evaluated once by Reyna-Bensusan et al. (2019), and the health risks associated with FA or 
bottom ash (BA) from OWB remain largely unknown. Most previous studies focused on the emission 
profiles of biomass burning, and limited scientific evidence is available regarding the impact of 
OWB exposure on the environment and human health (Powrie et al., 2021).

To this end, the present study is a continuation of previous work by Ramadan et al. (2022b). 
Specifically, the existing disposal practices were identified through a randomized survey among 
the citizens of Semarang. In addition, the transect walk method was used to detect the potential 
waste burning incidents, and environmental risk was determined by multiplying the total waste 
burning in Semarang by the potential BC and GHG emissions reported in literature. Finally, FA 
and BA residues from the open burning of household waste were characterized in terms of their 
chemical speciation and potential health risks. This study was focusing to the FA/BA residues and 
not discussing the exhaust gas because the information was already presented in the previous 
work. Our findings can fill the gaps in high-level data inventories of OWB and support appropriate 
policy and decision making aimed at reducing emissions from the waste sector.  
 
2 METHODS 
 
The study involved four sub-activities: an online questionnaire survey, a transect walk survey, 
environmental risk assessment, and health risk estimation. Detailed information on each sub-
activity is provided in the following sub-sections. 
 
2.1 Online Questionnaire Survey 
An online questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the current waste disposal 
practices and open burning potential in Semarang. The questionnaire comprised nine questions, 
including the name of the respondent (secured as privacy), sub-district where they live, number 
of family members, number of family members who burned their waste, burning frequency 
(daily), common waste disposal practices, availability of waste collection services, availability of 
door-to-door collection vehicles, and frequency of waste collection. According to Semarang City 
Statistical Agency, the total population of Semarang City is 1,656,564. Thus, using the formula 
shown by Hu et al. (2019), the sample size at a 95% confidence level and margin of error of 5% 
can be determined as much as 385, which later becomes the minimum data amount. Therefore, 
the questionnaires were distributed to 408 citizens. However, after data cleaning, answers from 
only 344 respondents were selected for analysis because of completeness and validity. Descriptive 
analysis was applied to the questionnaire data. The number of respondents (ra–d) from rural, 
outer peri-urban, inner peri-urban, and urban areas was 86, 85, 89, and 84, respectively. To 
determine the average number of family members (FMOB) who burned their waste and occurrence 
possibility of a burning waste event (BEa–d) in each cluster, Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) were used.

In Eq. (2), BF is burning frequency, which was defined daily, and 90 represents the maximum 
day of burning frequency. If the respondents reported no burning frequency in a specific area, BF 
was considered 90. 
 
2.2 Transect Walk Survey 
The transect walk survey followed the method described by Ramadan et al. (2022b). The 
surveys were conducted at the same location and following the same methods during the dry 
season from May to July 2021 in semi-lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The surveys 
were conducted in 16 of the 144 sub-districts of Semarang. Sub-districts with similar geography, 
demographics, and waste collection services were selected based on clustering results. In each 
sub-district, a transect line of approximately 10 km was set in a loop or straight line. Each cluster

Volume 23 | Issue 5 | 220412 
comprised four sub-districts representing urban, inner peri-urban, outer peri-urban, and rural 
areas. Before the field survey, the surveyor was trained to ensure the same perception of waste 
pile measurement along the transect line. The surveyor documented the waste pile; flattened it; 
and then recorded the coordinates, dimensions, and burning conditions. Unburnt waste piles along 
each transect line were characterized and brought to the laboratory for burning tests. Detailed 
information on the burning test can be seen in Ramadan et al. (2022b). The amount of waste 
burned at the city scale was extrapolated by multiplying the average waste pile density by the total 
sub-district area in each cluster. This coarse estimation was used to calculate the environmental 
risk of OWB. 
 
2.3 Environmental Risk Assessment 
After estimating the total waste burned, the environmental risk caused by CO2, CH4, and N2O 
emissions was calculated using the equation derived from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Volume 5 (Waste) (Beltran-Siñani and Gil, 2021). BC emissions were 
calculated separately because they are not included in the IPCC inventory. Therefore, BC emissions 
from OWB must be quantified separately, as this component is categorized as a short-lived climate 
pollutant (SCLP) and presents a higher GWP than CO2 or CH4 (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). 
Eqs. (3–6) were used to estimate CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC emissions from open burning incidents 
in Semarang.

Mwb represents the wet weight of waste burned in the city (t y–1), dm is the dry matter fraction 
of the burned waste, CF is the fraction of carbon in the dry matter, FCF is the fraction of fossil 
carbon in the total carbon, CE is the combustion efficiency, CoF is a conversion factor of 10–6 
kg mg–1, and j represents the type of waste being burned. Some parameters, such as dm, CF, and 
FCF, were derived from default data in the IPCC inventories. From recent studies, the emission 
factors (EFs) for CH4, N2O, and BC were set at respectively 4, 0.24, and 4.7 g of pollutant per 
kilogram of burned wet waste. All EFs are based on Tier 1 or global emission default where 
assumed the waste contains 25–50% of DOC and 2% of N in dry matter and 60% of moisture 
content (Beltran-Siñani and Gil, 2021; Sharma et al., 2019). All emissions were converted to 
ton year–1. Then, GWP was calculated by summarizing the number of equivalencies for each 
pollutant (CH4, N2O, and BC) to CO2 (Em). The values of 100-year GWP or CO2-eq (GWPk) for CH4, 
N2O, and BC were 34, 298 (Hawthorne et al., 2017), and 1,100 (Bond et al., 2011), respectively. 
Total GWP of OWB was calculated using Eq. (7). 
 
2.4 Health Risk Estimation 
The burning test followed the description by Ramadan et al. (2022b) and Park et al. (2013). 
The test was considered complete when fresh waste was completely burned. FA was collected 
using an isokinetic cyclone separator during the burning test. TPM and BA were further analyzed by

identifying metal- and PAH-bound particulates. TPM and BA (0.1 g) were analyzed at the Advanced 
Chemistry Research Center, National Research and Innovation Agency, Indonesia. Metal-bound 
particulates were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry 
(ICP-OES). PAHs were analyzed by preparing 10 g of FA and BA samples and extracting them using 
50 mL of dichloromethane while shaking for 6 h. The extract was concentrated to 2 mL using a rotary 
evaporator and then transferred to amber glass vials for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(GC-MS) analysis. 
Potential health risks were evaluated by considering the cancer risk (CR) following human exposure 
to metals and PAHs, specifically among people who burn the waste. Since municipal waste 
burning is mostly conducted in the backyard, many people surrounding the house may have the 
same possibility of being exposed to FA. The average exposure doses of metal- and PAH-bound 
particulates from FA and BA were estimated using Eqs. (8–10), presented by Keshavarzi et al. 
(2015), Liang et al. (2019), and Khan et al. (2020).

D represents the exposure dose, which involves three main pathways, namely ingestion (Ding), 
dermal contact (Dderm), and inhalation (Dinh). C is the total concentration of soil PAHs and metals 
(mg kg–1). IRing and IRinh are the ingestion and inhalation rates, respectively (mg day–1). FE represents 
the frequency of exposure (days year–1). ED indicates the duration of exposure (year). BW is the 
average body weight (kg). AT is the lifespan (d). In equation for the dermal contact exposure 
dose, SA represents the surface area of the skin exposed to contaminants (cm2), AF is the dermal 
adherence factor (mg cm–2), and ABS is the factor of absorption. PEF is particle emission factor 
(m3 kg–1) in the inhalation exposure dose calculation (Dinh). 
CR of hydrocarbon-bound particulates was estimated using Eqs. (11–14) (Liang et al., 2019), 
and chronic risk exposure caused by heavy metals from each pathway was determined using 
Eq. (15). The hazard index (HI) was determined to estimate the overall chronic risk (Eq. (16)). The 
CR of only Cd, Pb, and Ni was considered since these metals are carcinogenic. Cd, Pb, and Ni 
contamination occurs through inhalation; therefore, CR caused by these metals was estimated 
by multiplying the inhalation exposure dose Dinh with CSFinh and accounted for 6.3, 9.8, and 0.042 
for Cd, Pb, and Ni, respectively. Pb can also be ingested, resulting in the values of 0.0085 mg kg–1 d–1 
of CSFing. The human threshold set by the U.S. EPA (2001) for CR is > 10–6. The higher the CR value, 
the greater the carcinogenic risk to humans (Khan et al., 2020).

3 RESULTS 
 
3.1 OWB Practices in Semarang 
Indonesia has two classifications of cities, namely city and regency; a typical regency has a less 
dense population and a larger area than a city. Semarang is the capital city of the Central Java 
Province, which explains the availability of an efficient waste collection system covering almost 
all sub-districts. This may reduce the possibility of improper waste disposal practices. However, 
from our randomized questionnaire survey, OWB was found to be the second most common waste 
disposal practice. As shown in Fig. 1(a), other improper practices, such as burying and direct disposal 
in the river, also exist. The proportion of composting, recycling, and reuse was small (2% in total), 
indicating the presence of a linear or conventional system (collection, transport, and disposal) in 
the city. The door-to-door waste collection in Semarang is managed by each neighborhood unit (NU) 
or association (NA), which gathers waste from households and brings it to the waste collection site 
(WCS). The municipal government manages the transportation of waste from the waste collection 
sites to landfills. From areas near the landfill, the door-to-door waste collection vehicle directly 
brings the collected waste to the landfill. Each NU/NA has a different waste collection system, as 
shown in Fig. 1(b); three-wheeled motorcycles are the major household waste collection vehicles 
in Semarang. Waste from some areas is not collected by vehicles and burning or direct disposal 
of waste into the environment are the common practices in such areas. Respondents from the

rural and outer peri-urban areas are most likely to burn their waste rather than bringing it to the 
nearest WCS. 
Fig. 2 presents some interesting findings regarding waste burning practices in Semarang. The 
proportion of people in families who burned waste was higher in rural areas than in other areas. 
This may be attributed to the lower waste collection frequency and availability of larger 
backyards in rural areas. Therefore, the higher the frequency of waste collection, the lower the 
possibility of waste burning or other improper waste disposal practices. A higher proportion of 
family members burning their waste implies that the practice has already become a habit for 
residents in rural areas. However, the present survey was based on an online questionnaire that 
was open to random citizens in the city, and the possibility of bias may therefore be high. Next, 
the transect walk survey was undertaken to precisely identify and model waste burning events 
in Semarang. 
 
3.2 Number of OWB Incidents 
Burned waste in Semarang exhibited specific characteristics. As such, organic matter and wood 
or branches dominated the waste composition of burned waste in Semarang (62.7%). As shown 
in Fig. 3, plastic waste (15.7%) is burned along with organic waste, which may contribute to higher 
BC emissions. Inert materials, such as glass and metals, were detected in outer peri-urban area, 
which accounting for 22.8% or the highest percentage compared to other region, indicating a 
lower burning efficiency in this region. People in rural areas are more likely to burn organic matter, 
wood, or branches than those in other areas as much as 82.4%. The highest burning of backyard 
waste was noted in rural areas. This may be attributed to the availability of larger backyards in 
rural areas than in other areas. However, the proportion of plastic in burned waste tended to be 
higher in outer and inner peri-urban areas which is 16.3% and 25.0%. Then, the greatest contributor 
to plastic waste burning was the inner peri-urban area. Interestingly, outer peri-urban area

showed a greater diversity of waste being burned since almost all the waste composition except 
glass and miscellaneous exceed 10% of total composition. The average pile density of waste 
found in Semarang was 232.62 ± 26.98 kg m–3. Nonetheless, among burned waste, organic waste 
(leaves > yard waste > food waste) and LWTR (wood > textiles > leather > rubber) accounted for 
the highest share, followed by plastic, paper, and other waste/miscellaneous. Polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET, 5.4%) contributed to the highest burned plastic fraction in Semarang, 
followed by low-density polyethylene (LDPE, 4.9%), polyvinyl chloride (PVC, 3.5%), high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE, 1.4%), polypropylene (PP, 0.2%), polystyrene (PS, 0.1%), and other plastic 
waste that does not belong to or is a combination of the other six categories of plastic waste, 
such as bisphenol A polycarbonate (PC), or bioplastics (0.2%). 
As shown in Table 2, waste burning per capita was the highest in rural areas, followed by the 
outer peri-urban, inner peri-urban, and urban core areas. Since the scaling-up method is based 
on total areas in the cluster, outer peri-urban areas were the highest potential contributor to 
OWB. Overall, rural and outer peri-urban areas are the potential hotspots of OWB. Even urban 
core areas were not free of burning incidents, indicating that burning practices are preferred for 
waste management even in urban cores regardless of the availability of a waste collection system. 
However, as in the case of urban cores, in the other places, the frequency of non-burning incidents 
was lower than that of burning incidents. 
 
3.3 Environmental Impact of OWB 
Coarse estimation results demonstrated that CO2 (25,260.32 t y–1) is the largest pollutant 
emitted from OWB, followed by BC (365.30 t y–1), CH4 (310.89 t y–1), and N2O (18.65 t y–1). Because 
the GWP of BC over a 100-year horizon is higher than that of other pollutants, OWB practices emit 
a higher CO2 equivalency than methane (Table 3). Specifically, at least 53,809.66 tons of CO2-eq are 
emitted annually in Semarang from OWB practices. Based on data from 2018, Syafrudin et al. 
(2021) estimated that the overall emissions from the waste sector were approximately 1,650 kt; 
however, the authors ignored the potential of waste burning events and attributed the highest 
emissions to uncontrolled landfills. Moreover, previous studies used different approaches (tiers 1 
and 2) to create data inventories. 
 
3.4 Health Risks of OWB 
As shown in Table 4, nine hydrocarbon compounds and eight metal elements were detected 
in FA and BA collected from OWB. Among individual PAHs, some compounds, such as Nap, Bip,

Ant, Flua, Nnt, and Tp, were detected in both FA and BA samples. Meanwhile, Ace and Fle were 
detected in FA alone, whereas Pyr was detected in BA alone. Among PAHs bound to particulates, 
the highest concentrator (FA and BA) was Tp with the average concentration of 0.896 mg kg–1 
and 0.403 mg kg–1 for the FA and BA, respectively. The order of concentration from the highest 
to lowest in FA after Tp was Pyr (0.236 mg kg–1) > Flua (0.180 mg kg–1) > Ant (0.139 mg kg–1) > 
Nnt (0.067 mg kg–1) > Nap (0.052 mg kg–1) > Bip (0.046 mg kg–1). While for BA, the order after Tp 
was Nnt (0.316 mg kg–1) > Bip (0.232 mg kg–1) > Ant (0.241 mg kg–1) > Fle (0.187 mg kg–1) > Flua 
(0.130 mg kg–1) > Ace (0.103 mg kg–1) > Nap (0.067 mg kg–1). Heavy metal concentrations in FA 
and BA were comparable. Specifically, concentrations of Zn of FA and Mn of BA were 2,072.35 
and 1,699.26 mg kg–1, which were significantly higher than those of the other metals. Since the 
present study is the first to evaluate the open burning of municipal waste, specifically in Indonesia, 
no historical or background concentrations are available for comparison. In the present study, as 
it can be seen in Table 4, the order of metal concentrations from the highest to lowest was Zn 
(2,072.35 mg kg–1) > Mn (1,383.40 mg kg–1) > Cu (124.81 mg kg–1) > Cr (87.63 mg kg–1) > Pb (43.58 
mg kg–1) > As (17.25 mg kg–1) > Cd (16.18 mg kg–1) > Ni (14.19 mg kg–1) in FA and Mn (1,699.26 
mg kg–1) > Zn (975.31 mg kg–1) > Cu (124.81 mg kg–1) > Cr (41.44 mg kg–1) > Pb (39.53 mg kg–1) > 
As (22.10 mg kg–1) > Cd (5.96 mg kg–1) > Ni (5.32 mg kg–1) in BA. Of the nine metal elements 
selected, only Hg was not detected during measurement. 
Furthermore, CR was measured to evaluate the potential carcinogenic effects of exposure to 
environmental pollutants. Three potential exposure pathways exist: ingestion, dermal contact, and 
inhalation. Details of calculation for each compound and element are provided in supplementary 
material, and the carcinogenic risk of exposure is presented in Table 5. Children are at a higher 
risk of exposure to metals and PAH-bound particulates, which produce adverse effects. Ingestion 
is the greatest risk pathway for both PAHs and metals emitted from OWB activities, followed by 
dermal contact and inhalation. The total carcinogenic risk from inhalation is identical for children 
and adults, although adults are at a greater risk of dermal contact. The maximum observed CR 
was approximately 4.77 × 10–6, which is still within the tolerance threshold for humans.

Although the CR value was within the tolerance threshold for humans, HI indicated a greater 
potential for chronic health problems due to open burning activities. According to Keshavarzi et 
al. (2015), an HI of > 1 implies adverse health effects due to burning activities. Accordingly, FA 
may produce adverse health effects on children and adults. An aggregate HI was found in Table 6 
to be more than 1 for FA in children (1.05) and adults (1.26) which indicates the possibility of 
non-carcinogenic risks in the burning activities. Therefore, adults may experience more significant 
health effects than children due to FA. Dermal contact was the most significant pathway of adverse 
health effects with the maximum value of HQ is 1.15, followed by ingestion (0.83), and inhalation 
(0.00081). Specifically, the HQ through inhalation is the lowest than ingestion and dermal contact. 
The HQ for child through ingestion, both in BA (0.75) and FA (0.85) were found to be higher than 
adult (0.11 and 0.10 for FA and BA). The different result found in dermal contact where the higher 
HQ value found in adult (1.15 and 0.61 for FA and BA).  
 
4 DISCUSSION 
 
OWB practices are dominant in rural and outer peri-urban areas of Semarang because of the 
lack of waste collection services. Reyna-Bensusan et al. (2018) stated that regular waste collection 
and availability of waste collection facilities can reduce the intensity of OWB in urban and peri-urban 
areas. These speculations are consistent with the reports of Nagpure et al. (2015), who recorded 
the highest number of burning incidents in areas with a low socioeconomic status (SES) in India. 
Low-SES areas are similar to rural or peri-urban areas, which have a larger area but a lower population 
density. Typically, waste collection in such areas is extremely limited, and larger backyards are 
available at the household level. These contrasting socioeconomic profiles result in different 
burning profiles in selected study areas (Ramadan et al., 2022b). For instance, in rural areas of 
Mexico, over 65% of the total generated waste is burned, which is comparable to the amount of 
waste burned in rural areas of Semarang; meanwhile, < 10% of waste in urban areas is burned 
(Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). In addition, differences in lifestyle, income, and resources result 
in diverse waste disposal patterns (Mihai et al., 2021). In the present study, rural and outer peri-
urban areas were the largest contributors to open burning, where 10% of the total generated 
waste was burned, assuming that the total waste generation of 1,662 tons per day in Semarang 
according to the calculation of Ramadan et al. (2022b). Furthermore, intensive OWB may be driven 
by the lack of law enforcement and environmental knowledge among the residents. Residents 
are often unaware of the legal consequences of OWB (Mihai et al., 2021). In fact, OWB is a common 
waste disposal practice following waste collection by local authorities, such as in Indonesia (Ramadan 
et al., 2022b), South Africa (Haywood et al., 2019), Mexico (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018), India 
(Nagpure et al., 2015), Nepal (Das et al., 2018), Eswatini, and Ghana (Nxumalo et al., 2020). 
Residents tend to burn their uncollected waste rather than burying or disposing it off into water 
streams because (1) they do not have any other option to manage the generated waste and (2) it is 
easy to eliminate waste from their sight. Therefore, realizing that OWB is dangerous and damage

their property may be one of the motives to prevent OWB (Nxumalo et al., 2020; Ramadan et al., 
2022a).  
Data on the amount of burned waste and its composition are essential to provide scientific 
evidence and establish appropriate waste management systems and policies (Haywood et al., 
2019). Ramadan et al. (2022b) conducted a transect survey in the rainy season and noted that 
the composition of burned waste in outer peri-urban areas differed between the dry and rainy 
seasons. In the rainy season, the proportion of plastic waste was the lowest in burned waste. 
Overall, however, seasons did not significantly change the composition of waste being burned. 
In addition, waste composition is an appropriate tool for estimating GHG and particulate emissions 
and predicting the potential risks to citizens. For instance, burning of HDPE and other types of 
plastics may emit CO2, CO, NO2, SO2, and PM (Nxumalo et al., 2020). However, the composition 
of burned waste shapes the extent of risks and amount of contaminants released. Therefore, the 
inventories of emissions differ across cities or countries (Park et al., 2013; Reyna-Bensusan et al., 
2019). The urban areas of Semarang City present a lower waste burning percentage (9.7%) 
compared to other cities such as Vientiane City, Laos (15%), Steung Saen Municipality, Cambodia 
(21.2%), Padang City, Indonesia (11.5%), and Agra, India (24.2%) (Babel and Vilaysouk, 2016; 
Menikpura et al., 2022; Nagpure et al., 2015). In the present study, the amount of waste burned 
per capita in the urban areas of Semarang was the same (0.012 kg day–1) as that reported in the 
Kathmandu Valley. Meanwhile, the amount of waste generated per capita in the Kathmandu 
Valley (0.40 kg day–1) was half of that generated in Semarang (Das et al., 2018). Conversely, 
despite the similar amount of waste generated per capita (0.85 kg day–1), the amount of waste 
burned per capita was higher in urban area of Mexico (0.048 kg day–1) than in Semarang (See 
Table 7). However, the amount of waste burned per capita in rural areas of Mexico (0.280 kg day–1) 
was lower than that in the rural areas of Semarang (1.098 kg day–1) (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). 
This finding is interesting because rural areas represent a higher burning intensity, thereby acting 
as a hotspot of open fires in the city. 
Some gaseous pollutants and PM are emitted during burning. This issue is well known, because 
open burning also emits BC, which shows a higher GWP than methane and carbon dioxide. 
However, as BC is not included in calculations according to the IPCC methodological, its emissions 
are often underestimated and beyond prediction (Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2019). BC has been 
categorized as an SLCP, different from other long-lived GHGs (Bond et al., 2011). Reyna-Bensusan 
et al. (2018) estimated annual BC emissions of approximately 24,840 tons over a 20-year horizon 
in Huejutla, Mexico, which is higher than that estimated in Semarang. In the present study, BC 
emissions from OWB contributed to over 5% of the relative total emissions in the city. Open 
burning can act as a source of many local respiratory illnesses and problems through inhalation 
of the generated smoke. However, this activity is underestimated because of the lack of data 
(Reyna-Bensusan et al., 2018). 
Based on the chemical speciation of particulate emissions, adults and children are at a potential 
chronic risk due to open burning incidents. Some metals can enter the body via dermal contact, 
ingestion, and inhalation pathways. Even though internationally accepted precautionary criteria 
have been set against metal- and hydrocarbon-bound particulates, residents may still experience 
pulmonary and respiratory illnesses in the case of lack of interventions against OWB. Since the 
value of HIs were all higher than the permissible limit, the more contact with both PAHs and trace 
elements can cause several disorders (Keshavarzi et al., 2015). In addition, people who are directly 
exposed to open burning may experience certain health problems, such as abdominal pain, 
headache, hypertension, glioma, and mental effects because of metals-bound particulate (Khan et 
al., 2020). However, those symptoms can be derived from other causes which need further in-depth 
study.  
Regarding problems and solutions, some lessons learned from previous studies may help 
decision makers reduce the environmental and health effects of OWB. First, a decentralized waste 
management system may be an appropriate short-term solution for an isolated and unserved 
waste collection system. As reported by Chaudhary et al. (2022), improved burning devices can 
reduce the emissions and health effects of waste burning, including landfill fires. Further, 
community-based solid waste management, as a decentralized system, can be used to reduce 
OWB activities (Budihardjo et al., 2022). Second, promoting circular economic opportunities among

local leaders, such as upcycling and selling of valuable waste, can improve the economic benefits 
to citizens even in rural areas (Mihai et al., 2021). Third, increasing environmental knowledge 
through specific planned activities may encourage people to better manage their waste and stop 
burning waste. Inadequate waste management systems, which are supported by the lack of 
environmental consciousness, may increase the possibility of exposure to PAH- and metal-bound 
particulates emitted from open burning activities. Finally, a consolidated approach from waste 
management stakeholders is required to obtain an appropriate solution to reduce burning incidents 
(Permadi and Kim Oanh, 2013). Since the present study used some emission factors derived from 
literature, future studies should analyze precise emission factors for OWB to obtain a higher-tier 
inventory of health hazards and emissions. Moreover, different demographic characteristics 
should also be consideration when evaluating the cause behind OWB practices in the city level.  
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
 
To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to comprehensively reveal the 
extent of waste burning in Semarang, the associated amount of emissions, and the potential 
health risks of OWB incidents. Rural and outer peri-urban areas are the highest contributors to 
OWB and should be noted as focus areas for reducing the climate impacts of OWB. Furthermore, 
BC emissions from open burning significantly contribute to GWP. Therefore, preventing OWB 
may contribute to the achievement of SDGs. From our findings, OWB is associated with a small 
CR, particularly due to emitted particulate matter. However, exposure to OWB may be associated 
with a high risk of certain chronic diseases. Thus, preventive measures are warranted against 
OWB at the household level.

Domestic, or household-level, open burning of plastic waste is a source of air pollutants and greenhouse
gases that are often neglected in emission inventories. Domestic open burning is a considerable concern
in Guatemala due to the lack of access to waste collection services, particularly in rural areas. This paper
oﬀers the ﬁrst attempt to estimate emissions from the domestic open burning of waste at the city and
departmental levels in Guatemala. Data were collected from the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala
and analyzed to determine the change in plastic waste generation over time as well as the
socioeconomic factors that may aﬀect the extent of plastic waste generation and burning. The annual
per capita masses of plastic waste burned were used to estimate emissions from domestic open burning
of plastic waste in the region of Xalap´an, the cities of Jutiapa and Guatemala city, and all 22 departments
in Guatemala. Our results show that rural areas burn more waste domestically, likely because of a lack of
access to waste collection, and 30.4% of OC, 24.0% of BC, 23.6% of PM2.5, and 2.4% of CO2 emissions in
Guatemala may not be accounted for by excluding open plastic burning as a source.
Environmental signicance
Domestic burning of plastic waste is a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and household air pollution (HAP) that aﬀects human health. This is of
particular concern in countries such as Guatemala, where burning is a main method of waste disposal in rural areas. Current emission inventories do not
include emission data on the domestic open burning of plastic waste, which is an under sampled and understudied source of emissions. We nd that including
emissions from the domestic burning of plastic waste in emission inventories would notably increase current emission estimates. Quantifying such emissions
can prevent underestimation of emissions, provide more accurate local, departmental, and national total emission estimates, and inform ways to mitigate the
release of GHGs and HAP.

Introduction
The open burning of plastic waste in domestic, or household-
level, res is a global human health and climate change
concern that has not been well studied. Burning of plastic waste
is of particular concern in the Global South,1–4 especially in
countries such as Guatemala, where the management of solid
waste has become an issue due to a lack of access to infra-
structure, resources, and services necessary to properly manage
and dispose of waste.5 For this reason, waste is oen disposed
of through methods that are harmful to the environment,
including disposing through burning, burial, or in bodies of
water.6 This is particularly concerning for plastic waste, as
plastics that enter marine ecosystems through these waste
disposal methods can accumulate in sediments and induce
physiological stress in aquatic organisms and food chains if
ingested.7–10
In Guatemala, where the present study was conducted,
plastics make up approximately 17.3% of waste generated,11,12
and 43% of all households dispose of their waste, including
plastic, through domestic burning.6 These percentages increase
in more rural areas of the country, which have fewer waste
disposal resources and are in remote locations, far from
municipal waste services.5,6,13 Residents of such areas must
resort to domestic burning to dispose of plastic waste, which
poses the risk of releasing toxic air pollutants into their home
environment. Thus, waste burning could indicate that waste
collection infrastructure must be improved to create better ways
to dispose of waste.

Domestic plastic waste burning can occur both in outdoor
trash res and indoor kitchen res using solid fuel cookstoves.
A laboratory study quantifying emissions from cookstoves
found that although plastic bags produced fewer emissions
than other startup materials, such as kerosene, newspapers,
fabric, and wood shims, the burning of plastic bags to ignite
res still contributed to increased cookstove re emissions.14
Plastic waste burning contributes to emissions of greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and toxic substances, including carbon dioxide
(CO2), ne particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of
2.5 mm or less (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC),
volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs).15–19 The chemical composition of PM2.5
due to plastic waste incineration and smoldering res includes
BC, OC, ammonium, chloride, nitrate, sulfate, antimony (Sb),
and other trace elements.16
Household air pollution (HAP) from the burning of plastic
waste in stoves20 and cooking res poses a harmful respiratory,
cardiovascular, and overall human health hazard.21–26 A recent
study measured EFs for solely dry plastic waste burns and found
that using dry plastic waste instead of biofuels can decrease
open waste burning emissions, although these burns were
conducted in improved devices as opposed to those in more
traditional stoves.20 The health threat from waste burning is still
a particular concern for women and children, as they primarily
occupy the domestic sphere.27–29 In Guatemala, ambient PM2.5
exposure is estimated to result in 4105 annual deaths, 2420 total
years of healthy life lost due to disability (YLD), and 1.4 billion
USD in health damages, including the cost of minimizing the
likelihood of premature death, or mortality, and the cost of
morbidity based on the country's average wage rates.30,31
However, despite being a source of GHG emissions and HAP,
domestic waste burning, usually a mix of organic and inorganic
materials, like plastic, is scarcely sampled and is understudied
as a source of emissions.17 Current emission inventories have
limited data from domestic burning of plastic waste, which
could result in an underestimation of total emissions.32–34
Accurately quantifying emissions is important for determining
mixing ratios of GHGs and mass concentrations of other air
pollutants released into the air from diﬀerent emission sour-
ces.16,17,28 Our study examined plastic waste generation in
households in one community in the Xalap´an region in the
Department of Jalapa to estimate emissions of various pollut-
ants from plastic burning and to determine the eﬀects of
potential interventions to reduce plastic waste among study
participants. In our study, “plastic” refers to mostly single-use
household plastic items, such as plastic packaging, bags,
plates,
utensils,
straws,
gloves,
bottles,
and
containers,
disposed of by the participants in our study.
Since domestic burning of plastic waste is a common form of
waste disposal in Guatemala, the purpose of this paper is to
estimate emissions and contributions to total national emis-
sions from the domestic burning of plastic waste. This study is
the rst local and regional emission estimate of chemical
species due to the domestic burning of plastic waste in Guate-
mala. We estimated emissions from domestic plastic waste
burning in Guatemala, including: (1) in the La Fuente rural
community from the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala; (2) at
the
departmental
level
for
Guatemala's
22
departments
(Fig. S1†);6 (3) in Jutiapa, the capital city of the Department of
Jutiapa, which has a population that is about equally urban and
rural, and is located approximately 40 kilometers from Jalapa;
and (4) in Guatemala city, the capital of the Department of
Guatemala, which has a population that is 91% urban.6 We
initially aimed to investigate the city of Jalapa, which is the city
closest to the Xalap´an region; however, the World Bank11,12
lacked data on the city of Jalapa. Therefore, we chose to estimate
emissions in the city of Jutiapa, as it is close in population size
and location to Jalapa.

Methods
2.1
Working groups, questionnaire, and data collection
We conducted a 10-week working group session to discuss solid
alternatives to burning plastic waste in one rural indigenous
community in the Xalap´an region of Jalapa, Guatemala. This
region lacks access to formal municipal or private waste
collection programs. One community was chosen based on
accessibility to public transportation, the presence of a large
meeting space to conduct weekly activities, and the community
leadership committee's approval of the study. All accessible
households were visited and asked if they would be interested in
participating in any combination of the following three activi-
ties: (1) in-home participatory observation of plastic waste
disposal; (2) a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices (KAP)
survey;35 and (3) a 10-week working group session to discuss
alternatives to burning plastic. The working group session was
conducted in Spanish and met weekly between June and August
2019. Eighty-seven participants (5 male; 82 female) attended the
sessions, which included topics on recycling plastic waste, the
adverse eﬀects of plastics on the environment and human
health, and how to reduce, reuse, and repurpose plastic waste to
improve solid waste management. A sociodemographic ques-
tionnaire (see Table S1†) was verbally administered to partici-
pants from 50 households who attended the rst or second
working group sessions. These participants were also provided
with burlap bags and asked to collect all plastics that they would
have normally burned in an indoor or outdoor re in the bag for
a week. The mass of plastic waste generated per household was
weighed, recorded, and taken to the local dump or recycled
weekly by our project staﬀ. Each participant collected house-
hold plastic waste over a four-week period. The study protocol
and informed consent were approved by the Institutional
Review Boards (IRB) at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala
and Emory University. Written informed consent was obtained
from study participants who participated in the sociodemo-
graphic questionnaire and the collection of plastic waste.

Calculating emissions
To quantify emissions from the domestic burning of plastic
waste for 62 chemical species in the Xalap´an region, we used
a Monte Carlo sampling methodology.36,37 The emission factors
(EFs) that were used to calculate emissions are taken from the

Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment
(NAMaSTE), which took place in 2014, and EF values were
measured from burns containing plastics as waste.16,28
An EF is a value that contains the unit of mass of a pollutant
released into the air per kilogram of the fuel that is burned.16
Limited data were available for emission factors (EFs) from
waste burning of specically plastics in traditional stoves.
Several studies have measured EFs from waste burns. However,
these EFs were either measured from mixed waste burns or fuel-
based burns that contained separate, specic kinds of plastic
waste (i.e., plastic packaging versus plastic foam), rather than
exclusively plastic waste burns.38–41 The NAMaSTE study is
unique in that it measures EF values from homogeneous plastic
waste burning that this paper focuses on. Although burning
conditions in Nepal and Guatemala would diﬀer, studies
measuring EFs from plastic waste burns and conducted in
Guatemala were not found. The NAMaSTE study obtained data
that most closely t our purposes of estimating emissions from
domestic plastic waste burning res. We used the NAMaSTE's
EF values from re 16 and plastic burns 1 and 2 (the plastic
waste burns)42,43 because of the lack of studies measuring EFs
for plastic waste burning in Guatemala and NAMaSTE's location
in the Global South.
We also quantied the contributions of plastic burning to
total emissions, using the data from the Emissions Database for
Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v5.0), which did not
include open domestic burning in their estimates.16,17,32–34 First,
we created a normal distribution for the mass of plastic waste
burned per capita per year, based on the plastic trash data we
collected in the eld over a month (see Fig. S2†). Second, we
created a normal distribution for an EF for each of the 62
chemical species. Then, we conducted one million Monte Carlo
samplings, selecting one value for the mass of plastic burned
and the other for the EF from the two distributions and multi-
plied them. This methodology was used to calculate emissions
due to the uncertainty associated with the mass and the EF
estimates used. The histogram distributions that resulted from
running a Monte Carlo simulation indicate the range and
probability of possible results for the emission estimates based
on this uncertainty. We used the following equation to nd the
distribution of emissions for each species:
Ei = M × EFi
44
Ei – emissions of air pollutant i [g per year]. M – mass of plastic
burned [kg per year]. EFi – emission factor of air pollutant i [g
per kg plastic burned].
To quantify emissions for each of the departments in Gua-
temala, we rst estimated the mass of plastic burned, using the
most recent Guatemalan 2018 census data6 on population, the
number of households, and the number of households that
burn waste. We rst distributed the average total mass of plastic
waste generated annually per capita in Guatemala, using the
results from our study (12.2 ± 5.8 kg per capita per year) for
a lower boundary estimate and the World Bank value (29.3 kg
per capita per year) for an upper boundary estimate.11,12 The
main cities where data were collected by the World Bank were
Guatemala city, Antigua, and Jutiapa, which are higher-income
areas located in departments with lower poverty rates than
Jalapa, where Xalap´an is located (see Table S2†).6,11,45 Therefore,
lower and upper boundary estimates were used to account for
the varying income levels of the locations where data were
collected, which could aﬀect the estimated per capita waste
generation estimate.46–52 To simplify calculations and allow for
regression analysis between waste generation per department
and socioeconomic and demographic factors in our study, each
mass estimate was distributed among the 22 departments in
Guatemala according to the population in each department.
Individual- or household-level data were not provided by the
World Bank to determine the deviation in per capita plastic
waste generation. Therefore, the singular value of 29.3 kg per
capita per year, rather than a normal distribution, was used for
distributing plastic waste generation by the department. We
then quantied the mass of plastic burned based on the ratio of
households that burn waste in each of the departments, using
the census data. Based on this method, the total estimated
plastic burned for the population in Guatemala was 80.2 Gg per
year for the lower boundary estimate and 193 Gg per year for the
upper boundary estimate. Finally, using the estimated mass of
plastic burned per department and the EF distribution based on
the mean and standard deviation, we created the emission
estimates for each department for the 62 chemical species. The
estimated per capita emissions were compared among the 22
departments in Guatemala. We also multiplied emissions by
the departmental population and summed the results to
determine the total annual national emissions from burning
plastics for PM2.5, BC, OC, CO, and CO2.
For the city-level estimates, we used the World Bank data on
the mass of total waste generated per capita per day and the
percent of total waste that is plastic for Guatemala as a whole, as
the World Bank lacked city-specic data for per capita waste
generation and plastic waste percent composition. We also used
the waste collection rate for Guatemala city (87.5%) and Jutiapa
(28.0%), separately.11,12 There is no data for Jalapa, so we used
the city of Jutiapa as a proxy for Jalapa. We chose Jutiapa
because it is the most proximate city (55 km distance) of
a similar size to Jalapa, as Jutiapa had a population of 145 880
and Jalapa had a population of 159 840 in 2018.6 The diﬀerence
in waste collection rates in diﬀerent locations exemplies the
lack of access to waste collection services in more rural areas,
such as Jutiapa, as compared to more urban areas like Guate-
mala city. The rate of waste not collected, provided by the World
Bank,11,12 was assumed to be burned in order to provide
maximum emission estimates from plastic waste burned.

Data analysis
All the data analyses and descriptive statistics, including
means, standard deviations, and correlations, as well as
signicance tests (i.e., t-test and ANOVA) were conducted using
R version 4.0.2.53 Signicance tests were used to determine
whether education and wealth, measured by cell phone, radio,
and color television ownership and internet access, signicantly
aﬀected the amount of waste generated by the participants. The

categories for education were as follows: no formal education,
incomplete primary education, complete primary education,
and secondary education. The categories for cell phone, radio,
and color television ownership and internet access were binary
for whether the participants did or did not have ownership or
access to these commodities. Monte Carlo sampling and
emission calculations were also conducted using R.

Results and discussion
3.1
Demographic information
All respondents to the Xalap´an region survey were females, with
an average age of 36 ± 11 years, and the median number of
people living in each participant's household was six people (see
Table 1). Only one participant was studying and had completed
13 years of formal education at the time of our study. The
highest level of education completed by most of the participants
was incomplete primary education (46%), demonstrating low
levels of education received by most of these rural female
participants. Most (88%) of the participants did not work
outside of the home. The most common stove used for cooking
in Jalapa was a poyet´on (52%), which is an elevated open re
stove without a chimney and, in terms of pollution, is similar to
an open re stove. Women were in charge of cooking and waste
disposal, which included domestic burning of plastic waste or
other materials. As a result, they are more prone to harmful air
pollutant exposure. Decreasing plastic waste from household
burning and cooking could thus reduce exposure to pollution
and adverse health-related eﬀects of this exposure.
3.2
Plastic waste generation in the Xalap´an region of Jalapa,
Guatemala
The average weight of plastic waste generated per household for
weeks 1 through 4 in the study was 1.31 ± 0.66 kg, 1.12 ± 0.91
kg, 0.92 ± 0.70 kg, and 0.99 ± 0.77 kg, respectively. The average
amount of plastic waste generated by the participants in
Xalap´an over the four-week period was 3.34 × 10−2 ± 1.58 ×
10−2 kg per person per day (see Table S3†).
We conducted hypothesis tests to determine: (1) whether the
average amount of plastic waste generated per household

signicantly changed during the four weeks; and (2) whether
ownership of assets (cell phone, radio, color television,
computer, internet access) and level of education had a statis-
tically signicant impact on the mass of domestic plastic waste
generated. Since the distribution of the total mass of plastic
waste generated per household was slightly right skewed, the
variable for the mass of plastic waste generated per household
was log-transformed when conducting the signicance tests.
There was an overall decrease in the average amount of
plastic waste generated per household over time (Fig. 1). The
decrease in plastic generation was signicant when comparing
the plastic waste generation of week 1 to week 2 (two-tailed two-
sample t-test, p = 0.07), week 3 (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p =
0.001), and to week 4 (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.007;
see Table S4†). These results suggest that the workshops and
trainings conducted during the study could have contributed to
a
reduction
in
the
amount
of
plastic
waste
generated
throughout the course of the study. There was a very slight
increase in the mass of waste generated from week 3 to week 4;
however, this diﬀerence was insignicant (two-tailed two-
sample t-test, p = 0.51). This result could be a preliminary
indication of a plateau point for the extent of the eﬀect of the
workshops on the average mass of plastic waste generated.
However, the participants did see this study as an opportunity
to dispose of items that are not easily disposable and that they
had not been able to dispose of due to a lack of access to formal
waste collection. So the rst measurements were more likely to
contain more larger plastic items, such as broken plastic chairs
or toys. Therefore, the decrease in the mass of plastic waste
generated over the four weeks could be aﬀected by a decrease in
large-mass plastic items being brought for measurement and
disposal. There was not a signicant correlation between the
number of persons living in a household and the weight of
plastic waste generated (r = −0.08, p = 0.58). This result
suggests that other factors may better explain the diﬀerence in
the amount of waste produced by each household.
As shown in Table 2, no signicant relationship was
observed between the amount of plastic waste generated and
education level (F = 0.35). Those who owned a cell phone
generated more waste overall, but the diﬀerence in waste
generation between cell phone owners and non-owners was not
signicant (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.62). Those who
owned a radio generated more waste overall, but the diﬀerence
between radio ownership and non-ownership was insignicant
as well (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.50). The relationships
between the amount of plastic generated and: (1) color televi-
sion ownership (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.05) and (2)
internet access (two-tailed two-sample t-test, p = 0.07) were
found to be statistically signicant. Those with a color television
or internet access generated signicantly less plastic waste than
those without a color television or without internet access. This
relationship between television or internet access and the mass
of plastic waste generated may result from both variables being
indicative of higher income households that are more likely to
aﬀord durable items. The purchase and use of cheaper,
disposable, and single-use plastic items is more likely in lower
income households that cannot aﬀord higher quality items.
These diﬀerences would thus contribute to higher amounts of
plastic waste being produced in lower income households. Our
results can be compared to a previous study that found that
non-biodegradable,
including
plastic,
waste
generation
decreases from low income to lower middle-income groups,
although this waste generation then increases for middle,
upper-middle, and highest income groups.54 Other studies have
found organic or total solid waste generation to be positively
correlated with the household income level,46,47,49–52 suggesting

that waste composition and the amount of waste produced per
waste type depend on the income level.
Income data are needed to determine the factors that are
indicators of wealth in the rural community of Xalap´an, Gua-
temala, so we can test whether the correlation found with color
television and internet access is related to wealth. In this study
we chose not to ask working group participants about their
household income levels as this would have been perceived as
invasive.
3.3
Plastic waste burning emission estimates
The estimated emissions for PM2.5 and CO2 in the Xalap´an
region are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the Xalap´an survey, 84% of
households indicated that they burned their waste as their
primary mode of waste disposal (see Table S3†). Among the
people whose primary mode of disposal is burning, the quan-
tied average amount of plastic waste that would have been
burned per person per day was 2.66 × 10−2 ± 1.32 × 10−2 kg
(see Table S3†) based on the waste collected. Comparing this
with the total mass of plastic waste collected, it was found that
approximately 80% of the mass of plastic waste generated came
from households that use waste burning as their primary mode
of waste disposal (see Table S3†). This percentage (80%)
compares well with the percentage of households that burn
waste as their primary mode of waste disposal in Xalap´an (84%).
These results indicate that the percentage of households that
primarily disposes of waste through burning could be used as
a proxy for calculating the mass of plastic waste burned. We
thus used this value to estimate the average mass of plastic
burned in each department in Guatemala.
The lower and upper boundary estimated mass of plastic
waste burned at the department level in Guatemala based on
the 2018 Guatemalan census data are shown in Table S2.† There
is a large range from 0.645 kg per person per year to 61.4 kg per
person per year, depending on the location. One reason for this
range is likely the diﬀerence in access to private or municipal
waste collection services in urban versus rural areas within each
department. There is a moderate positive correlation between
the percentage of the population in each department that is
rural, and the average mass of plastic waste burned per capita
per year (Fig. 3). A simple linear regression model between these
variables has an R2 value of about 0.63, which suggests that
about 63% of the variance in the average mass of plastic waste
burned domestically can be explained by the size of the rural
population.
The estimated average mass of plastic waste burned based
on the Guatemalan census data was higher in the Department
of Jutiapa (7.44 ± 3.52 kg per capita per year lower bound
estimate; 17.9 kg per capita per year upper bound estimate)
than in the Department of Jalapa (6.04 ± 2.86 kg per capita per

year lower bound estimate; 14.5 kg per capita per year upper
bound estimate) and the Department of Guatemala (1.26 ±
0.594 kg per capita per year lower bound estimate; 3.02 kg per
capita per year upper bound estimate). The mass of plastic
waste generated in the cities of Guatemala city and Jutiapa was
28.1 kg per capita per year and 15.4 kg per capita per year,
respectively (see Table S5†). The percent of plastic waste
assumed to be burned in Jutiapa (87.5%) was notably higher
than that of Guatemala city (28.0%). Although the per capita
plastic waste generation in Guatemala city is about two times
that of Jutiapa, a lower mass of plastic waste is domestically
burned in Guatemala city (7.87 kg per year), as compared to
Jutiapa (13.5 kg per year). This diﬀerence in the waste collection
rate, and thus assumed domestic waste burning rate, highlights
the lack of access to waste collection services in more rural
areas, even cities with a population over 100 000, such as Jutiapa
and Jalapa, compared to Guatemala city. Using this estimated
mass of plastic waste burned, we calculated emission estimates
for the 62 species at the department level in Guatemala using
both methods (see Tables S6 and S7†). Maps of the distribution
of emissions of six pollutants in 22 departments are shown in
Fig. 4.
EDGAR v5.0 currently does not include emissions from the
domestic burning of plastic waste. Our results show that
including plastic waste burning in the EDGAR v5.0 emissions
inventory could increase national emission estimates by
between 6.71 × 106 ± 3.37 × 106 kg per year (5.62 ± 2.82%;
lower boundary estimate) and 1.61 × 107 ± 2.46 × 106 kg per
year (13.5 ± 2.06%; upper boundary estimate) for PM2.5 and by
between 2.07 × 108 ± 9.90 × 107 kg per year (0.564 ± 0.369%;
lower boundary estimate) and (4.99 × 108 ± 3.03 × 107) (1.36 ±
8.25 × 10−2%; upper boundary estimate) for CO2 (see Table 3).
Table 3 also summarizes the estimated total emissions and
percent increases in national emissions for BC, OC, and CO
emissions, if domestic burning of plastic waste was included in
the EDGAR v5.0 (ref. 32–34) emission inventory.
Estimated emissions from the domestic burning of plastic
waste ranged from 2.63 × 104 ± 1.32 × 104 kg per year for PM2.5
and 8.11 × 105 ± 3.87 × 105 kg per year for CO2 in the
Department of Sacatep´equez to 8.46 × 105 ± 4.25 × 105 kg per
year for PM2.5 and 2.61 × 107 ± 1.25 × 107 kg per year for CO2 in
the Department of Alta Verapaz for the lower boundary estimate
(see Table S8†). For the upper boundary estimate, they ranged
from 6.33 × 104 ± 9.64 × 103 kg per year for PM2.5 and 1.96 ×
106 ± 1.19 × 105 kg per year for CO2 in the Department of
Sacatep´equez to 2.03 × 106 ± 3.10 × 105 kg per year for PM2.5
and 6.28 × 107 ± 3.82 × 106 kg per year for CO2 in the
Department of Alta Verapaz (see Table S9†). Most of the pop-
ulation in Alta Verapaz (68.7%) lives in rural areas (see Table
S2†), which may contribute to a lack of access to nearby waste
disposal services, leading to high emissions from plastic
burning in the department. According to the Instituto Nacional
de Estad´ıstica Guatemala (INE; National Statistics Institute of
Guatemala),55 the Department of Alta Verapaz had the highest
poverty rate in the country in 2014, with 83.1% of its population
experiencing poverty (see Table S2†). The socioeconomic status
of the Department of Alta Verapaz may contribute to a lack of
monetary resources for establishing formal waste disposal
programs. The Department of Alta Verapaz, similar to Xalap´an,
also has a high indigenous population, with 93.2% of its pop-
ulation being indigenous (see Table S2†). Therefore, a similar
reduction strategy might be helpful for the regions of Xalap´an
and Alta Verapaz. Providing access to information and educa-
tion about the benets of waste reduction and the risks of waste
burning to human health and the environment were possible
strategies in Xalap´an that could be useful in Alta Verapaz. More
importantly, however, increasing nancial resources for waste
disposal and establishing local waste disposal infrastructure
would help decrease waste burning as a method of disposal and
reduce GHG and air pollutant emissions in these areas. The
information presented in this study may be useful in deter-
mining the extent and types of interventions that should take
place to improve waste collection infrastructure and thus
reduce plastic waste generation in other similar communities.

Conclusions
Our results show that including emissions from the domestic
burning of plastic waste in emission inventories could result in
notable increases in emission estimates, including 7.23 ± 3.58
to 17.4 ± 2.3% for OC, 5.70 ± 2.77 to 13.7 ± 1.38% for BC, 5.62 ±
2.82 to 13.5 ± 2.06% for PM2.5, and 0.564 ± 0.369 to 1.36 ± 8.25
× 10−2% for CO2, and 0.154 ± 0.157 to 0.371 ± 0.303% for CO
(see Table 3). Furthermore, providing access to proper waste
disposal programs in low-resource countries, especially in rural
areas, could mitigate the amount of waste burned domestically
and thus reduce indoor and outdoor air pollution from this
source.
Limitations of this study include a small sample size and
a short length of the data collection period for the mass of waste
generated by the participants in the Xalap´an survey. A larger
sample of households and a longer period of data collection
would provide a more reliable estimate of the average mass of
plastic waste generated and burned. Data on the mass of plastic
waste generated by each household before the workshops were
also not collected and introduced a limitation for estimating
emissions. More data are needed regarding emissions from
domestic burning of plastic waste both before and aer any
waste reduction intervention from the workshops to provide
a baseline for comparison and to assess the eﬃcacy of the
intervention. Future studies may also improve upon this study's
data collection by gathering information on corresponding
household income levels and fuel types used in order to deter-
mine whether or how these factors would aﬀect plastic waste
generation and emissions released when burning.
Another limitation is that the EFs used to calculate emis-
sions in our study were not local to Guatemala due to a lack of
studies quantifying EFs from homogeneous plastic waste
burning. More data on EFs from plastic waste burning in Gua-
temala are needed to provide more accurate local estimates.
Collecting data on the division of the mass of plastic waste
burned outdoors versus indoors would also help address this
uncertainty. The current lack of data on the mass of plastic
waste disposed of through domestic burning is also a limitation

our study faced. Our emission estimates at the city level relied
on the assumption that any waste that was not collected by
private or municipal waste collection service was burned, even
though other forms of plastic waste disposal, such as burial or
dumping in public spaces, including in bodies of water, are also
used when no formal waste collection infrastructure is avail-
able. This aspect of the calculations may have resulted in an
overestimation of emissions at the city level. Future research
would benet from direct measurements of the mass of plastic
waste burned domestically to provide more accurate estimates
of emissions that come from the domestic burning of plastic
waste.
Despite these limitations, our research has taken the rst
steps towards providing emission estimates from domestic
burning of plastic waste in Guatemala. Domestic burning of
plastic waste results in signicant emissions; lowering these
emissions by improving waste collection, particularly in low-
income countries and rural areas, will be important for
improving air quality, mitigating climate change, and reducing
adverse human health impacts.

In order to reveal the pollution characteristics and risk level of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposed to air from open burning in China, PM2.5 samples were
collected from the open burning of different types of municipal solid waste (MSW). The
component of MSW differed from plastics, paper, wood and bamboo, and mixed garbage.
A ﬂue gas dilution sampling system was employed to simulate open burning testing on
MSW samples from different functional urban areas. Emission characteristics and health
risk assessments of PAHs in PM2.5 were analyzed. The results showed that the 16 PAHs
were detected ranged from 16.0 to 10,386.9 ngm−3. The total PAH concentration of wood
and bamboo wastes was the highest (24,512.1 ngm−3), while that in plastics was the
lowest (4,084.7 ngm−3). Speciation composition of PAHs in PM2.5 with high-molecular-
weight PAHs was dominant compared to low-molecular-weight PAHs. Health risk
assessment showed that the proportion of samples with the lifelong lung carcinogenic
risk value greater than 10–6 was 68.7% of the totals, most of the PAHs in PM2.5 had a
certain risk of cancer. The speciation of Bap posed the greatest health risks to adults and
children. The carcinogenic sequence of four components of wastes was as follows: wood
and bamboo > mixed garbage > paper > plastics and the risk for adults was about
2.26 times higher than for children. Totally, the PAHs speciation of BaP, DBahA, BbF, IcdP,
BaA, BkF, and Chr in PM2.5 from the open burning of MSW can bring high carcinogenic risk
to human health by respiratory exposure, and the risk value of adults is higher than that of
children. The ﬁndings show the different conclusion with the results of related researches
on the environmental effect of waste incineration power plants or incinerators. Therein, it
can provide supplementary data to evaluate the impact of open burning of MSW on
ambient air quality.

INTRODUCTION
With
the
rapid
development
of
urbanization
and
industrialization, the production of municipal solid waste
(MSW) in China has increased sharply. Open burning is an-
other waste treatment method besides landﬁll and composting. It
is a kind of incomplete combustion under the condition of
insufﬁcient air or heat, and the whole burning process without
any puriﬁcation facilities and subsequent treatment (Kakareka
and Kukharchyk, 2003; Cheng et al., 2020). The complex
composition of MSW, including food waste, paper, rubber
plastics, e-waste, and medical waste, emits hazardous and toxic
species during the open burning process (Park et al., 2013; Peng
et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2019). However, due to the simple and
convenient operation and the low cost of clearing and
transportation, open burning is quite popular in small and
medium-sized cities and fails to be prohibited (Kumari et al.,
2019).
Open burning is small-scale and widely distributed, whose
burning sites in cities are usually located near densely populated
areas, such as residential areas, commercial areas, and areas with
heavy trafﬁc (Zhang et al., 2011; Solorzano-Ochoa et al., 2012;
Lundin et al., 2013). It is reported that the annual production of
MSW in China has reached more than 300 million tons, of which
30 percent is treated by open burning (Wiedinmyer et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2017). And with the increase of MSW production, the
frequency of open burning is also increasing. Therefore, the
impact of pollutants from open burning on the environment
and humans has received urgent attention of society.
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the hazardous
pollutants produced by the open burning of MSW, which can be
emitted from the pyrolysis or incomplete combustion of waste
plastics,
wood,
paper,
and
other
carbon-containing
fuels
(Mugica-Alvarez et al., 2015; Abdel-Shafy and Mansour, 2016;
Kalisa et al., 2018). Additionally, it is reported that the PAHs
released from open burning contributes to 61.0% of the total
anthropogenic PAHs’ emissions (Nagpure et al., 2015). PAHs are
a group of semi-volatile hydrocarbons that widely exist and many
PAHs are carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic (Haritash and
Kaushik, 2009; Pongpiachan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). PAHs
can persist in the environment and accumulate in vascular plants,
which can be harmful to human health for their position in the
food chain (Zha et al., 2018). Exposure of PAHs can cause
temporary hazards such as eye inﬂammation and respiratory
tract irritation (Unwin et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2019), as well as
long-term health effects such as lung cancer, liver damage, and
cardiopulmonary death (Zhang et al., 2009). In addition,
Particulate PAHs (PM-PAHs) is considered to be more
harmful to human health because they are carcinogenic,
teratogenic, and mutagenic, and they can be inhaled and
deposited in the respiratory system (Barakat, 2003; Akhtar
et al., 2014; Alessandria et al., 2014). The research found that
children were more likely than adults to be exposed to air
pollutants (Gautam et al., 2020).
Open burning and PAHs emission have attracted the attention
of researchers of the world. Previous studies about waste burning
mainly focused on the research of waste incinerator and waste
incineration plant, while the research of open burning was lacked
(Meng et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2020). Deng et al. (2020) sampled
the air and soil collected near an urban solid waste incinerator in
Shanghai, measured the concentration level of PCDD/Fs in the air
and soil, and assessed the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic
risks. Meng et al. (2018) used AERMOD model to simulate the
spatial distribution of pollutants released from waste incineration
plants, and conducted risk assessment on respiratory exposure of
pollutants such as Pb, Hg, Cd and dioxins. Compared with waste
incinerator and waste incineration plant, open burning belongs to
the state of open and low temperature incomplete combustion,
the two have a big difference, so the study of waste incinerator and
waste incineration plant can not reﬂect the real state of open
burning. Secondly, studies on PAHs produced by open burning
mostly focused on ﬂy ash or bottom ash, and were limited to the
distribution and content of pollutants. There is a lack of studies
on PAHs in PM2.5 produced by open burning of MSW and few
studies on health risks caused by open burning (Peng et al., 2016;
Kumari et al., 2019). Chen et al. (2013) studied the production
and distribution of PAHs during open burning and incineration
of medical waste. The results show that the content of PAHs in
the ﬂy ash of the incinerator is much higher than that of the
bottom ash. In addition, health risks of different types of MSW
have not been comprehensively studied, so this study can provide
a supplement for the shortcomings of previous studies.
The PAHs produced by open burning of MSW can cause
serious harm to human body. It is necessary to analyze the
emission characteristics of PAHs from MSW open burning in
China, and the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) model and the
incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) model are utilized to
assess the toxicity and health risks of PAHs. It can provide basic
data and theoretical basis for disposal plan and PAHs emission
control by open burning.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Collection and Pretreatment of MSW
Samples
In this study, we selected waste paper, used plastics, waste wood
and bamboo, and mixed garbage as the samples. Random
sampling was carried out in the trash bins in the residential
areas, commercial areas, ofﬁce areas, and road cleaning areas of
the city, collected once every 7 days, 4 times in total. The samples
collected were dried four times and mix them naturally, then the
quarter method was used to reduce the four types of garbage into
samples that weighed 1 kg and were stored in a sealed container
for the next incineration operation.
Small-scale open burning simulation experiments were
conducted outdoors on four types of garbage samples with 12
groups, and each group of experiments was conducted with three
parallel tests. The ﬂue gas dilution sampling system was used to
collect samples: After the sample was ignited, the ﬂue gas entered
the dilution channel under the action of the blower and the
exhaust fan, and was connected to the PM2.5 cutter (MiniVol
TAS, AirMetrics, USA) at the end of the dilution channel. The
ﬂow rate of the dilution channel was 6 L/min. The portable

particulate matter sampler sampling PM2.5 in the ﬂue gas was
equipped with a quartz ﬁber ﬁlter membrane (Tissue quartz™
Filter 7,203, PALL, USA) at a time. The ﬁlter membranes were
placed in the mufﬂe furnace before sampling and were heated at
800°C for 4 h to remove carbon components, then they were
weighed for use after being cooled in the refrigerator for 24 h.
After the burning process, the ﬁlter membrane in the particulate
matter sampler was removed, placed in a membrane box, sealed,
and stored in the refrigerator.
Analysis of PAHs
According to the national environmental protection industry
standard (HJ646-2013), a PM2.5 sampling ﬁlter membrane
containing PAHs was cut and placed into a Soxhlet extractor,
and then 60 ml diethyl ether/n-hexane (V:V = 1:9) was added to
it. The extract was reﬂuxed at a rate of more than 4 times/h for
16 h, then was removed and added to anhydrous sodium sulfate.
This mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min. Approximately
30 ml of the extract was concentrated to 1 ml through K-D and
ﬁltered through an organic ﬁlter into a sample bottle. Finally, the
gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS, 7890A-5975C,
Agilent Technologies, USA) was used for detection. A total of 16
PAHs were determined in PM2.5 from the open burning of MSW:
naphthalene, acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, ﬂuorine, benzo [g,
h, i] perylene, indeno [1, 2, 3-cd]pyrene, dibenz [a, h]anthracene,
benzo [b]ﬂuoranthene, phenanthrene, anthracene, ﬂuoranthene,
benz [a]anthracene, chrysene, pyrene, benzo [a]pyrene, and
benzo [k]ﬂuoranthene.
Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Before sampling with quartz ﬁber ﬁlter paper, the ﬁlter paper was
placed in the oven for 12 h to remove moisture and impurities on
the ﬁlter paper, and was weighed three times before sampling to
ensure constant weight. After sampling, the ﬁlter membrane was
wrapped with tin foil and stored in the refrigerator to avoid
contamination of the sample. When testing samples, each sample
is tested three times to reduce error. The details can be seen in our
previous study (Cheng et al., 2020).
Human Health Assessment of PAHs
The Equivalent Toxicity Concentration
PAHs have attracted much attention due to their potential
toxicity. Benzo [a]pyrene (BaP) was the most representative,
and was used to evaluate the cancer risk of PAHs. In this
study, we used the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) model to
evaluate the potential risk of PAHs. The product of a single PAH
concentration and its toxic equivalence factor (TEF) was called
the equivalent toxicity concentration. In general, humans are
exposed to a mixture of multiple PAHs at the same time. The total
toxicity of the sample was expressed by the sum of the TEQs of
the individual PAH compounds, and the formula was as follows
(Sulong et al., 2019).

Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk of PAHs
The ILCR model can estimate the degree of harm to human
health caused by pollutants entering the human body in different
ways. Respiratory inhalation, dermal absorption, and hand-to-
mouth ingestion (oral ingestion) are the three pathways of human
exposure (Bai et al., 2019; Roy et al., 2019). Inhalation is
considered as the primary exposure path in previous studies
(Chen et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). Therefore,
respiratory inhalation was deemed to be the exposure pathway of
PAHs in PM2.5 from the open burning of MSW in this study. The
differences between children and adults on the respiratory rate
and
the
biochemical
response
to
toxic
substances
were
considered.
The lifetime average daily dose (LADD) of PAHs in the
smoke inhaled by the residents in the sampling environment
(open burning sites of MSW) was calculated based on the
inhalation rate, average lifetime, exposure frequency, and
other parameters. Based on the LADD of PAHs, the ILCR
of humans during exposure was quantiﬁed to assess the risk
of cancer from long-term exposure to open burning. Eq. 2
and Eq. 3 are used to calculate the parameter of LADD and
ILCR.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The Emission Feature of PAHs in PM2.5
From Open Burning of MSW
The average concentrations of PM2.5 generated by open burning
of plastics, paper, wood and bamboo, and mixed wastes were
11.2 mgm−3,
19.2 mgm−3,
71.0 mgm−3
and
78.5 mgm−3,
respectively. PM2.5 concentrations above 300 μg m−³ in the
Chinese atmosphere were deﬁned to be serious pollution, and
the concentration of PAHs produced by open burning can
reached at 37–261 times of it. A large amount of garbage
burning in the open inevitably leads to the increase of PM2.5
concentration in the air, which further leads to the decrease of air
visibility and increase of haze weather. The high concentration of
ﬁne particles also provided sufﬁcient carriers for PAHs generated
during the burning process, allowing more PAHs to be absorbed
in PM2.5 and subsequently enter the ambient air.
The variation of PAH contamination in PM2.5 produced by the
open burning of four kinds of MSW was shown in Figure 1. All 16
priority PAHs of the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA)were detected in thewaste samplesduringtheopen-burning.
The concentration of 16 individual PAH compounds in plastics, paper,
wood and bamboo, and mixed garbage was in the ranges of
16.0–812.6 ngm−3, 47.2–1,624.34 ngm−3, 20.3–10,386.9 ngm−3, and
16.2–8,146.8 ngm−3,
respectively.
The

mean
concentration happened in wood and bamboo wastes with an
average value of 1,532.0 ng m−3, and followed by mixed garbage
(1,399.6 ngm−3), paper (582.8 ngm−3), and plastics (255.3 ngm−3).
Phe from the open burning of wood and bamboo was the highest
concentration of the individual PAH compounds, which was 42.4% of
the total concentration of PAHs produced by wood and bamboo. The
concentration of PAHs in wood and bamboo wastes ﬂuctuated greatly,
and Ace was the lowest PAHs in wood and bamboo wastes, which was
only 20.3 ngm−3. The concentration trend of 16 PAHs produced by the
open burning of paper wastes was as follows: Fla > Pyr > BaA > Chr >
BbF > BaP > Phe > IcdP > BghiP > BkF > DahA > Ant > Nap = Acy >
Flu > Ace. Fla was the highest concentration of PAHs produced by
mixed garbage, which can reach 8,146.8 ngm−3. The concentrations of
PAHs during the open burning of plastic wastes were signiﬁcantly
lower than those of the other three types of MSW. The variation trend
of PAHs concentrationinplastic garbage was basicallysimilar withthat
in paper garbage, but the concentration of PAHs produced by plastic
garbage was less than twice that of paper garbage. The reason for this
was that plastic garbage contains high-density plastics such as beverage
bottles,anditwasdifﬁculttoachievefull combustionduetoinsufﬁcient
oxygen in the burning process, resulting in the presence of
corresponding pollutants in the combustion bottom ash. Totally,
the concentrations of PAHs produced by the four types of wastes
varied greatly, while the variation trends were generally similar.
Studies have shown that the average concentration of PAHs in
atmospheric particulates in Chinese cities was 3.3–910.0 ngm−3,
and the annual average concentration was 74.0 ngm−3. The
concentration of PAHs produced by the open burning of
urban household garbage far exceeded the concentration of
PAHs in urban air. It was difﬁcult to ignore the contribution
of open burning of MSW to the atmospheric environment. It is
well known that PAHs bound by ﬁne particulate matter can only
be removed by atmospheric dry and wet precipitation and rainfall
after they enter the atmospheric environment. Therefore, it is
necessary to control the occurrence of open burning at the source.
Although open burning has been banned in China, many cities
still have the phenomenon of “knowing the law and breaking the

law”, which requires the state and local authorities to strengthen
the control of it.
Speciation Composition of PAHs in PM2.5
According to the number of aromatic rings and molecular weight,
the 16 PAHs could be classiﬁed into three types: low-molecular-
weight PAHs (LMW-PAHs, 2,3-ring), median-molecular-weight
PAHs (MMW-PAHs, four rings), and high-molecular-weight
PAHs
(HMW-PAHs,
≥5
rings).
Figure

shows
the
distribution characteristics of PAHs according to their number
of rings. For plastics, the order of PAHs with different rings based
on their proportion was: four rings (55.3%) > 5 rings (24.3%) > 6

rings (11.6%) > 3 rings (8.3%) > 2 rings (0.52%). Paper was
similar to plastics in terms of the number of rings with the four
rings accounting for the largest proportion (51.4%) and ﬁve rings
accounting for 27.9%, while the proportion of PAHs with other
ring numbers was lower than that in plastics. The proportions of
PAHs with rings in mixed garbage and plastics were slightly
different. Among the mixed garbage, the 4-ring was dominant,
and its proportion reached 70.1%. The proportion of PAHs with
three rings was higher than that with six rings, and the proportion
of PAHs with two rings was only 0.07%. For wood and bamboo,
3-ring PAHs accounted for the most (53.1%), followed by the 4-
ring
(39.7%),
5-ring
(4.8%),
6-ring
(2.3%),
and
2-ring
(0.12%) PAHs.
The composition of different molecular weights in the four
categories of MSW can be seen in Figure 3. The ratios of LMW,
MMW, and HMW were respectively 1.0:6.2:4.1 for plastics, 1:5.2:
3.9 for paper, 7.5:5.6:1.0 for wood and bamboo, and 1.0:7.3:2.1 for
mixed garbage. MMW-PAHs were predominantly presented in
plastics, papers, and mixed garbage, whereas wood and bamboo
mainly contained LMW-PAHs. Generally, HMW-PAHs were
dominant compared to LMW-PAHs during the open burning
of MSW, which was similar to the phenomenon that the ﬂue gas
released from MSW incineration power plant were mainly
MMW-PAHs and HMW-PAHs with low proportion of LMW-
PAHs (Wang et al., 2006). The reason for this phenomenon was
that PAHs with two to three aromatic rings were mainly in the gas
phase, while PAHs with more than four rings were mainly
adsorbed by solid particles. The open burning of MSW is a
mode of incomplete combustion under the condition of
insufﬁcient air. Therefore, most of the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons produced by open burning are high polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. Compared with other components of
MSW, the burning of wood and bamboo is more complete, which
can cause the higher proportion of LMW-PAHs.
Health Risk Assessment of PAHs Emission
From Open Burning of MSW
In previous studies, BaP was widely used as the carcinogenicity
indicator to evaluate cancer risk, because it was regarded as Group
1 carcinogenic agent by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC). On that basis, TEFs have been established by
taking BaP as a toxic benchmark to calculate the TEQs of PAHs.
The order of TEQs of the PAHs produced by the four types of
MSW was: paper > mixed garbage > wood and bamboo > plastics.
The TEQs of paper reached up to 1,266.8 ngm−3, and those of
mixed garbage, wood and bamboo, and plastics were 924.3, 763.8,
and 437.4 ngm−3, respectively.
The TEQ calculated from the TEF for the 16 types of PAHs in
the PM2.5 from the open burning of four types of MSW can be seen
in Figure 4. Among the four types of wastes, the average TEQ value
of PAHs was 27.3 ngm−3 for plastics, 79.2 ngm−3 for paper,
47.7 ngm−3 for wood and bamboo, and 57.8 ngm−3 for mixed
garbage. For plastics, the TEQ trend of the 16 PAHs was as follows:
BaP > DBahA > BbFA > Chr > BaA > BkF > Phe > IcdP > Fla > Pyr
> BghiP > Acy > Ant > Nap > Ace = Flu. Among them, BaP as the
main contributor, its equivalent toxicity reached 218.1 ngm−3, and
the contribution rate reached 49.9%. The TEQ trend of PAHs from
the burning of paper was the same as that of plastics, but the value
was about 3 times that of plastics. From 0.02 to 351.2 ng m−3 was
the range of TEQ of wood and bamboo. It was worth noting that 4-
ring and 5-ring PAHs were the main contributors to the toxicity of
wood and bamboo, and their contribution rates were 25.0% and
60.7%, respectively. Chr and BbF in mixed wastes were much

higher than the other three components, and the sum of the two
accounted for 48.5% of the TEQs. The component of MSW had an
obvious impact on the toxicity of PAHs generated by the open
burning of MSW. The TEQ of the three PAHs (Bap, BbF, Chr)
accounted for a relatively high percentage of total TEQs in the four
samples, which were 47.2%, 14.3%, and 13.8%, respectively.
Assessment of Lifelong Lung Carcinogenic
Risk (ILCR)
The health risks of PAHs in PM2.5 from open burning to adults
and children were shown in Figure 5. In general, the less than or
equal to 10–6 ILCR value indicated that there was no cancer risk
or it could be negligible. And the ILCR between 10–6 and 10–4
means a certain potential carcinogenic risk in humans, but the
value was still in the acceptable range for humans. If the ILCR was
larger than 10–4, it indicated a serious threat to human health. The
carcinogenic risks of 16PAHs from the open burning of plastics,
paper, wood and bamboo, and mixed wastes for adults by
inhalation exposure were 1.3 × 10–3, 3.7 × 10–3, 2.3 × 10–3
and 2.7 × 10–3, respectively, all of which were 2.3 times higher
than those for Children (5.7 × 10–4, 1.7 × 10–3, 1.0 × 10–3, 1.2 ×
10–3). In this study, the ILCR values of PAHs were between 10–8
and 10–3. The proportion of samples with the ILCR value greater

than 10–6 was 68.7% of the total, while the parts with the ILCR
value greater than 10–4 accounted for 25.8%. The result showed
most PAHs in PM2.5 generated by the open burning of MSW had
a deﬁnite carcinogenic risk. Moreover, adults were more likely to
develop cancer through respiratory exposure than children.
The ILCR values of 16 PAHs from the open burning of paper
wastes for the respiratory exposure of children varied from 2.1 ×
10−8–9.8 × 10–4, with Bap has the highest risk. The rank order of
ILCR values of 16 individual PAHs from plastic burning was Bap >
DahA > BbF > Chr > BaA > BkF > Phe > IcdP > Fla > Pyr > BghiP >
Acy > Ant > Nap > Flu > Ace. BaP, DahA, BbF, Chr, and BaA from
plastics had obvious carcinogenic risks to adults, and only Bap had
obvious carcinogenic risks to children. BaP, DahA, BbF, Chr, and
BaA were also PAHs with obvious carcinogenic risks produced by
paper. Different from plastics, their risks to adults and children were
greater than 10–4. The ILCR value of BaP in wood and bamboo for
adults was as high as 1.0 × 10–3, which was higher than 10–4 and
obviously unsafe for humans. In addition, Phe was also a kind of
PAH produced by wood and bamboo with obvious carcinogenic
risk. Bap > BbF > Chr > BaA > BkF > DahA > Phe > IcdP > Fla >
Pyr > BghiP > Ant > Acy > Flu > Ace > Nap was the sort of PAHs
produced by mixed wastes according to ILCR value. The health risk
values of the ﬁrst 11 PAHs have exceeded the human health
threshold (10–6). Overall, the ﬁve types of PAHs (Bap, BbF, Chr,
BaA, BkF) from the open burning of plastics, paper, wood and
bamboo, or mixed MSW had certain cancer risks in humans.
Comparatively,
current
researches
mainly
focused
on
the
emission and environmental effect of waste incineration power
plants or incinerators, and the research results showed that the
carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of environmental exposure
to pollutants were at an acceptable level for the surrounding
residents (Meng et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2020). However, the
ﬁndings of our study show an opposite conclusion, which can
provide data and scientiﬁc basis for clarifying the impact of open
burning of MSW on ambient air quality and evaluating its potential
health risks. This study only considered the health risks of exposure
pathway of direct respiratory intake, while the routes of skin contact
and oral intake were not included tentatively. By integrating the
comprehensive exposure pathways, the risk assessment results will
be more accurate.
CONCLUSION
In summary, our study illustrated emission characteristics and
corresponding health risk assessment of PAHs in PM2.5 from the
open burning of MSW in China. We observed an obvious
variation of the content of PAHs in PM2.5 from the open
burning of different types of MSW. The total concentration of
16 PAHs produced by the open burning of mixed wastes was
higher than that of wood and bamboo, followed by paper and
plastics. The ring number distribution of PAHs also varied with
different garbage components. According to the health risk
model, partial PAHs generated from the open burning of
MSW were carcinogenic to the surrounding residents with
respiratory exposure. And the carcinogenic risk of PAHs
through respiratory exposure for the adult group was higher
than those for the children group. The prevention and control
actions are highlighted to be conducted to reduce and even
eliminate the open burning of MSW. Furthermore, more
investigations
focusing
on
the
pollutants
in
the
diverse
environmental medium like soil and water around the places
with frequent open burning of MSW are called for in the future,
so as to help manage the public health risks in response to
regional air pollution.

Blantyre, Malawi’s Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), or Queen’s, as 
it’s known locally, is the country’s largest public hospital. However, Queen’s is 
not served by regular municipal waste collection. Rather, most hospital waste 
(infectious and non-infectious) is gathered by grounds staff and openly burned, 
in several constantly smouldering piles, sending up clouds of smoke. Speaking 
directly to an identified knowledge gap on air quality impacts linked to trash 
burning and the paucity of African urban dwellers’ voices on air quality issues, this 
study employed a mixed-methods approach to both quantitatively measure the 
air quality around QECH, and to qualitatively investigate the perceived impacts 
amongst staff and caregivers. Low-cost sensors measuring particulate matter (PM) 
with particle sizes less than 10 μm (PM10) and less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), expressed 
as the mass of PM per volume of air (μg  PMx/m3 air) were recorded every 5 min at 
8 locations across the QECH for 2  months. Qualitative data collection consisted 
of 56 interviews with patients, caregivers and hospital staff (including janitorial 
and maintenance staff, nurses, doctors, and administrators). Our results show 
that safe air quality thresholds are consistently exceeded across space and time 
and that the most problematic air quality surrounds the shelter for caregivers and 
those receiving treatment for HIV/AIDS. Moreover, staff and visitors are severely 
impacted by the poor air quality within the space, but feel powerless to make 
changes or address complaints. Waste management interventions are desperately 
needed lest the patients who arrive at Queen’s leave with more health issues than 
the ones with which they arrived.

1. Introduction
Built in 1964, Malawi’s year of independence, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH), 
or Queen’s, as it’s known locally, is the country’s largest public hospital. Designed in the Tropical 
Modernism style of architecture popular within Africa in the late colonial period, Queen’s open-
plan form sprawls across a broad swath of central Blantyre, with dozens of wards, specialised 
facilities, and administrative buildings, linked together by a bewildering maze of covered 
walkways. A hive of around-the-clock activity, Queen’s bustles from dawn to dusk with a 
constant stream of patients, drawn from across the country, and maintains a city- like feel even

after dark as staff and stay-in family members cook and care for their 
in-patient dependants. Yet, for the first-time visitor, it’s not the 
architecture or the crowds that are the most striking when entering 
the grounds, but the smell. Immediately noticeable, even from the 
road outside the hospital, Queen’s is smothered by an acrid-smelling, 
white smoke, which hangs over the grounds day and night: the 
product of several constantly burning fires spread across the campus. 
Breathing this air, when a significant amount of burning is occurring, 
can be incredibly uncomfortable. Moreover, the tropical architecture, 
designed to let air and light circulate, means that even indoors, within 
patient wards, surgery theatres, and treatment areas, the air quality can 
also be unbearable. Poor air quality associated with burning, through 
released particulate matter (PM), has been linked to multiple negative 
health outcomes like asthma, heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and 
cancer among others (1–3). In a space of healing and recovery, why is 
such burning occurring, and how can it continue to persist?
Queen’s produces an immense amount of waste that it is unable to 
efficiently manage. The dozens of wards, offices, and kitchens, serving 
the hundreds of patients and staff, generates considerable infectious 
medical waste, mixed domestic and office waste, and kitchen waste, 
which needs to be removed and disposed of daily. Queen’s is not 
served by regular municipal waste collection. What municipal 
collection that is done is ad-hoc, sporadic, and based on the hospital’s 
available financial resources. Rather, most hospital waste (infectious 
and non-infectious) is gathered by grounds staff and burnt at the 
hospital’s incinerator, located at a central point within the hospital 
campus1 (4). However, the vast majority of the waste is not incinerated, 
as a new incinerator provided by the Ministry of Health in late 2019, 
is only able to handle a small percentage of the hospital’s waste. 
Furthermore, the incinerator is frequently inoperable, under repair, or 
without power.2 Rather, the waste is openly burned, in a constantly 
smouldering pile to the side of the incinerator building, sending up 
the aforementioned clouds of smoke, which choke the grounds 
(Figure  1). Innumerable other, smaller, fires, scattered across the 
QECH campus (Figure  2) contribute their part, as grounds and 
maintenance staff habitually burn leaves and other garden refuse. 
Furthermore, caregivers3 who reside separately on hospital grounds, 
cook for themselves throughout the day and night using biomass 
(charcoal or wood), and burn their own domestic waste. As a result, 
air quality at the hospital is a constant source of discussion, with 
patients, staff, and caregivers struggling to cope, when just breathing 
is, as the quote4 used in the title of this article, “unbearable.”
Challenges with solid waste management (SWM) are not unique 
to Queen’s, and remain persistent globally, particularly within African 
nations, and the Global South more broadly (5–8). Explanations for 
these disparities have centred on waste generation outpacing waste 
management infrastructure (7), and the high costs of waste 
management systems, which often prove unaffordable for many

2017 and 2021, when the new incinerator was commissioned, nothing was 
incinerated at all.

low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) (6, 9). Waste collection is 
an important step within SWM systems, and is a common barrier 
within LMIC contexts (5). Waste inequalities between high-income 
countries (HICs) and low-income countries (LICs) is often most 
pernicious and visible at the point of collection, with some HICs 
achieving 100% collection rates, while some African nations have rates 
well below 50% (10). Inequalities persist beyond collection, however. 
Even once waste is collected, municipalities in LMICs may burn or 
dump it in non-sanitary landfills due to the absence of further 
treatment or disposal options (11). According to Kaza et al. (12), 90% 
of waste in LIC is disposed of in unregulated dumps or openly burned, 
while the quantity of waste generation in these countries is expected 
to triple by 2050. As a result, open waste burning, in nations like 
Malawi, can be expected to become more prevalent.
Although hospital waste is among the common types of solid 
waste openly burned in LICs (in addition to municipal solid waste, 
sewage sludge, market or commercial waste, agricultural residues), the 
open burning of hospital waste has not garnered as much discussion 
as the burning of other waste fractions (11). The World Health 
Organization (WHO) defines hospital, or health-care waste, as waste 
generated by health-care activities, of which approximately 85% is 
general, non-hazardous waste, but the remaining 15% can 
be considered hazardous, and may be toxic, infectious, or radioactive. 
These infectious fractions are commonly incinerated in both high and 
middle-income countries, however in the absence of capacity, or costly 
incineration or autoclave infrastructure, open burning is often a last 
resort option for disposal in LIC contexts (13). The open burning of 
biomedical waste may reduce infection risk from potentially harmful 
pathogens, however, such waste may contain sharps, radioactive 
waste, mercury-containing instruments, and plastics, the open 
burning of which may result in the emission of dioxins, furans, and 
toxic particulate matter (11, 14). Moreover, although the sustainable 
and circular management of healthcare waste was highlighted at the 
past COP27 Climate Change Conference, the concepts, as Syms et al. 
(15) note, have not yet been widely taken up by healthcare systems, 
especially within the Global South.
Poor air quality in in African cities can be attributed to multiple 
factors, including vehicular emissions, dust, or the use of low-quality 
fuels for cooking, lighting, and heating; however, the open burning 
of waste has been identified as one of the key contributors to air 
pollution within urban areas (16–18). Although open trash burning 
is generally a problem in LICs, Wiedinmyer et al. (19) estimate that 
open trash burning contributes to 29% of the total global PM2.5 
anthropogenic emissions. Furthermore, it is of particular concern in 
Sub-Saharan African (SSA) cities, which are home to 19 of the 
world’s 50 biggest dumpsites (20). Particulate matter, is not specific 
to trash burning, but rather the product of any type of incomplete 
combustion and is one of the most commonly measured indicators 
for air quality. PM is measured in terms of its particle size and 
generally classified into PM with particle sizes less than 10 μm 
(PM10) and those with sizes less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), while one way 
of measuring the severity of air pollution is by expressing the mass 
of PM per volume of air (μg PMx/m3 air). PM has been linked to 
multiple negative health outcomes. Amongst particulate air 
pollution, PM10 and PM2.5 are of particular concern as they can 
penetrate deep into the lungs, and their exposure has been associated 
with asthma, heart disease, heart failure, stroke, and cancer (21, 22). 
In addition, burning can produce a wide range of atmospheric

pollutants including short lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as 
black carbon (BC). BC emissions are a major source of fine 
particulate matter, with a climate change impact up to 5,000 greater 
than CO2, and significant environmental health risk. As a result, the 
health impacts of ambient air particle pollution may be significant, 
especially for the most vulnerable. For instance, the IHME (23) 
estimates that PM related air pollution resulted in 4.14 million 
deaths worldwide (in 2019), of which, 394,000 occurred in Africa.

Yet, despite its importance, the story of air quality in Africa is 
worryingly incomplete. For instance, the WHO only collects data 
from 10 African countries (covering 39 cities) (24). Likewise, robust, 
epidemiological data from and for the African context is also 
lacking, though emerging data suggests strong correlations between 
PM and poor health outcomes (25, 26). Moving forward, it is not just 
the air at Queen’s which lacks clarity.
Utilising a mixed-methods approach, including a network of 
custom-designed air quality monitors and qualitative fieldwork with 
hospital staff, patients, and caregivers, the purpose of this investigation 
was to gain a multi-dimensional understanding of the impacts of the 
open burning at QECH. Specifically, this work aimed to intensively 
and longitudinally measure the air quality, in terms of particulate 
matter, at multiple locations at, and surrounding, the central burning 
point. Furthermore, we also aimed to qualitatively understand how 
affected individuals perceive air quality at QECH and understand 
potential health impacts.
This research responds to a several specific gaps within the body of 
academic air quality literature: although there has been ample 
discussion of air quality challenges in African cities (27–30), there is a 
paucity of data on air quality impacts linked to trash burning. In 
particular, within African cities, there has been a total dearth of 
scholarship on the burning of medical waste, or on air quality within 
hospital contexts. Furthermore, while the voices of the citizens of 
Northern cities (31–33) have been well documented on localised air 
quality issues, the voices of African urban dwellers have not been given 
the same consideration, and there remains a pressing need to 
understand how these populations experience the impacts of the open 
burning of trash within their communities and understand 
potential risks.
Findings suggest that particulate matter concentrations are 
routinely above the WHO guidelines and are especially worrisome at 
several locations. Over the course of the 2 month study, the hazardous 
limits for both PM10 and PM2.5 were exceeded at all locations except 
for the Lions Sight hospital. The limits were exceeded fewer than 50 
times at five of the locations, but the monitors at the Lighthouse 
Clinic and the Guardian Shelter recorded more than 50 instances 
above the hazardous limits. The extremely hazardous air quality at 
the Guardian shelter is mostly from cooking over open fires, while 
the PM at the Lighthouse Clinic is a function of being located directly 
adjacent to the smouldering waste pile.
Interviews show that patients, staff, and caregivers alike, are 
keenly aware that the air quality at Queen’s is poor, with most 
respondents reporting frequent respiratory-related illness. Many 
also linked the smoke to potential long-term health complications 
and expressed a belief that the pollution could be contributing to 
other, more potentially life-threatening diseases, such as asthma, 
cancer, and tuberculosis. Moreover, the tropical design of hospital 
buildings has rendered most coping mechanisms ineffective, with 
staff only finding relief at home: relief that is not available to the 
hundreds of patients and caregivers who sleep at QECH or are 
unable to leave.
In many contexts, waste burning is a necessary, but sporadic event 
with limited exposure. However, in the context of a large hospital, 
serving the sickest and poorest, this study shows that the consistent, 
and highly toxic smoke produced is an unrelenting and unnecessary 
burden that must be  addressed, lest the patients leave in worse 
condition than in which they arrived.
2. Materials and methods
This study utilised a mixed-methods approach to both 
quantitatively measure the air quality at eight locations around QECH, 
and to qualitatively investigate the perceived impacts amongst staff 
and caregivers. Although the work was conducted over one sustained 
period in late 2019, it must be contextualised within 5 years’ experience 
of research and activism within QECH by the authors.
2.1. Study site
The sensors were located within the QECH campus in consultation 
with hospital management. The goal was to locate sensors across the 
campus with a range of distances and directions from the incinerator, 
though the final decision was based on accessibility, the permission of 
the unit’s head, and convenience. Each of the locations is briefly 
described below and shown in Figure 2:
	•	 Lions Sight First Eye Hospital, often shortened to Lions Sight, 
is the largest eye hospital in Malawi and serves as the main 
teaching eye hospital for the Kamuzu University of Health 
Sciences (formerly College of Medicine). It is staffed by 5 
consultants and a team of clinical officers and nurses. It provides 
a mix of public (no cost) and private (at cost) services.
	•	 The Blantyre Malaria Project (BMP), established by Professors 
Terrie Taylor and Malcolm Molyneux, has carried out clinical 
research and patient care in the area of paediatric malaria, 
specifically cerebral malaria, for more than 30 years5. Its 
research infrastructure includes an administrative team, an 
inpatient research ward, an MRI centre, and an outpatient 
research clinic in Ndirande township and in other districts 
outside of Blantyre.
	•	 Ward 6B is a male ward for trauma and orthopaedic patients. It was 
established as part of the original hospital design. It is a 60-bed ward 
with a dedicated nursing station and treatment rooms.
	•	 The Blantyre Lighthouse Trust Clinic, also known as Umodzi 
Family Centre or simply, the Lighthouse Clinic, is one of four 
operating across Malawi. The clinics work in collaboration with 
the Ministry of Health (MOH) to provide integrated HIV testing, 
treatment and care for people living with HIV.
	•	 The Moyo Nutritional Rehabilitation and Research Unit, 
known on campus as uMoyo, is a 57-bed nutritional rehabilitation 
unit (NRU) for treating infants and children with severe 
malnutrition and acute illnesses. It is one of 104 operational 
NRUs in Malawi. It also has an outpatient therapeutic feeding 
program (OTP) for children with malnutrition who can 
be treated outside of the hospital.
	•	 The Mercy James Institute for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive 
Care (MJC), shortened on campus to Mercy James, was opened 
in 2017 by the NGO Raising Malawi, which was founded by 
Madonna. With 3 operating rooms and 50 beds, it is the first and 
5  BMP is credited with the development of the Blantyre Coma Score, which 
is used widely.

only first dedicated paediatric surgery hospital in Malawi. Prior 
to its opening, QECH had fewer than 10 intensive care beds.
	•	 The Administration Building is the operational hub of the 
campus, containing mostly offices and meeting rooms.
	•	 When a patient arrives at QECH, she or he will usually arrive 
with a guardian: someone to cook for them, buy medicine, do 
their laundry, and help them bathe. The Guardian Shelter is a 
gender-separated concrete floor shelter for sleeping along with a 
cooking pavilion and toilet/shower block that are maintained by 
a local NGO, Chira fund. Though simple, the facility is secure 
and offers one of the only free/accessible toilet facilities for 
visitors on the QECH campus.
2.2. Waste management
As the largest public hospital in the country, Queen’s produces an 
immense amount of waste. Hospital staff, such as doctors and nurses, 
primarily generate and handle medical waste (dry, wet, sharps), which 
is disposed of in separate waste bins labelled accordingly within the 
ward. Hospital visitors (caretakers and patients) generate food waste 
and are advised by staff to discard such waste in waste bins outside. 
Cleaning staff are responsible for emptying bins and maintaining the 
cleanliness of indoor and outdoor spaces. Collected bags of waste are 
temporarily stored in the sluice room, and the night-shift cleaners are 
responsible for transporting the waste on wheelchairs or trolleys to the 
incinerator for burning.
Yet, according to respondents and our own observations, waste 
management procedures within the hospital are fraught with challenges 
which impact the implementation of best practices. These challenges 
include the lack of a coherent hospital-wide waste management policy, 
insufficient waste management training for staff, and a persistent lack 
of material and financial resources. For instance, although a 
representative from the hospital administration was able to articulate 
a set of standard operating principles (SOPs) for waste management, 
doctors and nurses were generally limited in their understanding about 
its contents. Furthermore, cleaners, who are responsible for day-to-day 
cleansing and waste disposal, yet rate at the bottom of the institutional 
hierarchy at Queens, were unable to access or analyse hospital policy, 
and generally tended to rely on, what one cleaner6 described as, 
“experience” and “human judgement” when handling potentially 
hazardous waste. Moreover, although nearly all doctors and nurses had 
prior education on waste management best practices, cleaners began 
their waste handling duties without any prior waste management 
experience, and although there is an orientation programme for new 
hires, there is no regular refresher training or capacity building 
regarding waste for existing staff, at any level.
Despite its national prominence and international reputation for 
academic medical research, Queen’s is plagued by constant shortages 
of human and material resources. Yet, these shortages are not shared 
equally across the space, with a sharp division in cleanliness, resources, 
and quality of care between public wards, supported by the Malawi 
Ministry of Health, and the private wads with international funding, 
6  ID44, 2021-01-18.
such as the aforementioned Mercy James Institute. For staff, these 
shortages have manifested in poor salaries, missed pay cheques, failing 
infrastructure and limited supplies (4). Chronic shortages of black 
bags, waste containers and cleaning staff which has resulted in limited 
waste segregation, i.e., highly infectious items (bandages, gloves, 
syringes, and other sharps) are disposed of along with non-hazardous 
waste (food, newspapers, packaging). As a result, all waste is mixed, 
necessitating more burning than would be necessary if non-hazardous 
waste was diverted, and contributing to workplace risk, with reports 
of accidental exposure to potentially infected waste, including 
accidental pokes from improperly disposed of sharps, common 
amongst hospital staff (34). Regardless, separation ends at the point of 
collection. The hospital is not serviced by regular municipal waste 
collection, and as a result, nearly all of the waste produced by the 
hospital, hazardous and non-hazardous, has to be disposed of on-site, 
either within the limited capacity of the hospital incinerator, or more 
commonly, through open burning. The constantly smouldering pile 
of waste puts forth a continuous cloud of grey smoke, which mingles 
with the dozens of other fires on the grounds, from cooking fires and 
burning garden waste, and blankets Queen’s in a permanent cloud of 
foul smelling haze.
2.3. Measuring air quality
2.3.1. Hardware and software
The PM monitoring device centres around a Raspberry Pi 3 
Model B single-board computer complete with an operating system 
and storage space. The added advantage of storage space is that the 
data are not lost if the internet connection breaks down. Because the 
Pi can only read digital signals, we needed to include an analogue-to-
digital (ADC) converter. The particulate matter is measured by a Nova 
PM SDS011 High Precision Laser sensor that measures particles at 2.5 
and 10 μm in diameter in μg/m3. A list of the specific hardware and 
software components can be found in Appendix B.
2.3.2. Installation
The choice of where the sensors were installed was done in 
collaboration with the QECH administration, but the position of the 
sensors at the individual buildings were decided by the research team. 
Four air quality sensors were installed on the outside of buildings 
(Guardian Shelter, Mercy James, Malaria Project, Lighthouse Clinic) 
while the remaining four sensors were installed inside (Ward 6B, 
Administration, Lions Sight, uMoyo). All of the sensors were 
mounted to a wall at a height of approximately 2 m from the ground 
with the help of QECH maintenance department personnel. This 
height was chosen to both capture the approximate breathing zone 
and to prevent the public from tampering with the equipment. 
Additionally, we ensured that each inhalation pipe that pulled in 
ambient air was freely protruding in the building (room) to capture 
the air quality.
Because connecting each unit to a power supply was not possible, 
each monitoring unit was equipped with an external battery (5,000 
mAh) which powered the sensor unit for 3 days continuously. To avoid 
any down time, we changed the batteries every 2 days. Data were also 
collected from the sensor at the time of battery replacement. The 
sensors were capable of being connected to Wi-Fi, a feature which 
enabled wireless data access.

2.3.3. Qualitative methods
Qualitative data collection consisted of 25 interviews with 
caregivers and hospital staff (including janitorial and maintenance 
staff, nurses, doctors, and administrators) conducted in October and 
November 2019, as well as an additional 31 interviews conducted 
with staff, patients, and caregivers spread around the hospital’s 
various wards and departments in January and February 2021. 
Interviews were semi-structured, and included questions on hospital 
waste management practices, perceived best practices, and workplace 
health, safety, and risk. The first round of interviews included 
specific questions on air quality, while the second round focused on 
waste management more broadly. However, the semi-structured 
nature of the interviews allowed for the participants to raise topics 
of interest, and for unexpected themes to emerge. These interviews 
were supplemented by participatory observation recorded within 
detailed field notes, and supported by several years of sustained 
involvement by the authors in the waste management practices at 
the hospital.
Interview respondents were chosen using a purposive or 
judgement sampling regimen, i.e., a subjective sampling method in 
which respondents are selected based on their ability to effectively 
contribute to the study’s research objectives (35). All respondents were 
purposively selected based on availability, willingness to provide 
written, informed consent, and their individual insight into the 
questions posed within the study. Interviews were conducted in the 
local language (Chichewa), audio recorded, and transcribed into 
English. Participation was voluntary, and responses were recorded 
anonymously. Written, informed consent was obtained from each 
respondent prior to the interview. All relevant permissions were 
obtained from QECH beforehand, through consultations with key 
gatekeepers, including administration and staff (36, 37). The study was 
approved by the National Committee on Research in the Social 
Sciences and Humanities (NCRSH) of Malawi; Protocol 
NO. P.03/19/356. Collected data were analysed thematically and coded 
within the software programme Nvivo, which organises materials and 
assists with the coding process.
2.3.4. Limitations
Though extensive and useful in understanding the conditions at 
QECH, the data set would benefit from a comparison with background 
values. As trash-burning is extensive throughout the city, there were 
no obvious locations that could be confidently used as representative 
background values. And although there were several possible areas 
upwind and outside of town, the logistics and safety involved in 
accessing them to change the batteries meant that the measured values 
at Queens could not be  compared to a stable background 
concentration. Knowing the wind direction and velocity would have 
helped in better identifying the potential sources of the measured 
PM. However, the necessary equipment was not easily available in 
Blantyre at the time, and as an exploratory study, the immediate 
hazards for the staff and patients at QECH are relevant regardless of 
the burning source.
Knowing the exact burning locations and burning times, 
especially at the incinerator and the cooking times at the Guardian 
Shelter (though it is nearly constant), would have helped in better 
identifying the sources and movements of the plumes. However, given 
the size of the campus and its 24 h schedule, a much larger research 
team would have been required to quantify all the burning. Finally, the 
relative humidity, and the potential for interference was not accounted 
for; the measurements were not adjusted for humidity which could 
affect the values, though not enough to significantly alter the key 
findings and need for immediate action.
2.3.5. Computational reproducibility and data 
availability
R Statistical Software version 4.2.1, RStudio IDE version 
2023.3.0.386, and Quarto scientific publishing system version were 
used for quantitative data analysis and writing of the manuscript (38–
40). A set of additional R packages were used for data wrangling, 
analysis, and visualisation (41–51).
Raw data and analysis-ready processed data is available as an R 
package by Schöbitz et al. (52). The data underlying the tables and 
figures of this manuscript are contained in a repository alongside a 
reproducible document that contains the analysis code and the written 
narrative of the manuscript (53).
3. Results and discussion
The Malawi Bureau of Standards is the national agency responsible 
for setting and publishing all standards in the country. At the time of 
writing, the official website7 was not available. However, published 
work that references Malawian standards (54, 55) indicate that the 
maximum 24 h PM10 value is 25 μg/m3 and the maximum annual PM2.5 
value is 8 μg/m3. There is no daily maximum value for PM2.5. It should 
be noted that both of these values are at, or below, the level-4 interim 
WHO targets.
Therefore, for international comparisons and due to the lack of 
comprehensive 
Malawian 
Standards, 
we 
use 
the 
WHO 
recommendations as a basis of comparison for the measured values 
(55). The relevant particulate matter targets are presented in Table 1.
3.1. Particulate measurements
3.1.1. Peaks
Due to localised variation (air movement in the immediate area) 
and the density of the observations, the plotted 5 min data obscures 
persistent trends. The full set of 5 min data are plotted and presented 
in Appendix A. However, the number of measured values that 
exceeded the hazardous limit for both parameters are summarised in 
Table 2.
Over the course of the 2 month study, the hazardous limits for 
both parameters were exceeded at all locations except for the Lions 
Sight hospital. The limits were exceeded fewer than 50 times at five of 
the locations, and only the monitors at the Lighthouse Clinic and the 
Guardian Shelter recorded more than 50 instances above the 
hazardous limits. At the Lighthouse Clinic, the PM10 limit was 
exceeded almost twice as often as the PM2.5 limit, while at the 
Guardian Shelter, the reverse is true. Because the Lighthouse Clinic is 
within 50 m of the incinerator, the number and predominance of PM10 
peaks is characteristic of incomplete combustion and dust that is

typical for the area. Although there is trash burning at the Guardian 
Shelter, the main source of smoke is from the constant cooking. The 
residents at the Guardian Shelter are mostly cooking with coal and 
wood that is burned within small “improved” cooking stoves that are 
contained, in a row, within a dedicated cooking block. The fewer 
number of PM10 peaks is a testament to this intervention, though the 
frequency of PM2.5 peaks is still beyond acceptable.
3.1.2. 24 h averages
The 24 h averaged values (logged every 5 min) are presented for 
each location, for both PM10 and PM2.5 in Figure  3. As well as 
dampening local variation and peaks, the WHO air quality guidelines 
are also based on 24 h averages which are the standard against which 
the health risks can be judged.
Overall, PM2.5 values remained below 100 μg/m3 at 6 of 8 locations 
(Administration, Lions Sight, Malaria Project, uMoyo, Ward 6B, and 
Mercy James); PM10 values were consistently below 100 μg/m3 at the 
same locations, but with several average values extending slightly 
above, and then infrequently.
The daily averages at both the Lighthouse Clinic and the Guardian 
Shelter are both consistently higher for both parameters and the two 
averages closely follow the same general trends. Though the peaks at 
the Lighthouse Clinic were higher than the Guardian Shelter, the low 
values were consistently lower, indicating more times of little or no 
burning, unlike the Guardian Shelter emissions which were relatively 
constant. However, further analysis of 12 h averages (8:00–15:59 
(working hours) and 16:00–7:59 (evening)) did not indicate clear 
differences between the time periods; stated differently, the data did 
not clearly point to more or less burning in the day or at night.
3.1.3. PM ratios
Given that the type of fuel and the type of burning (contained vs. 
open) produce very different particulate “fingerprints,” the ratio of 
PM10 to PM2.5 values were examined to determine if a clear difference 
between locations, and therefore source, could be identified. The 
results are presented in Figure 4.
The results presented in Figure 5 illustrate both the presence of 
PM10 relative to PM2.5 as well as the range of values over which that 
ratio is observed.
Unlike the peak values presented in Table 2, the values presented 
in Figure 5 indicate the relative presence of larger (PM10) particles to 
smaller ones (PM2.5) regardless of their concentration: the ratio of two 
low concentrations can be  the same as the ratio of two high 
concentrations and is therefore more indicative of source than 
of proximity.
In general, the calculated ratios are concentrated between 1.25 
with few values exceeding 7.5. Three from each the Guardian Shelter 
and the Ward 6B exceeded 7.5 though the most values exceeding 5 
were at the Guardian Shelter. It is interesting to note that despite the 
large daily variations at the Lighthouse Clinic, the parameter ratios 
there were fairly consistent with few spikes, and only 2 days with ratios 
above 5.
An examination of the range of ratios is used to better understand the 
variability within a single day. For example, several of the calculated values 
at the Guardian Shelter have a range of more than 5, and 1 day had a range 
of close to 10, i.e., the minimum ratio recorded for that day was close to 1 
and the maximum value was over 10. The composition of emissions 
recorded at that location ranged significantly, and likely reflects a range of 
burning styles and/or fuel type.
3.2. Exposure data
The relative amount of time exposed to a given category of air 
quality is shown in Figure  5. Each square represents 1% of the 
measured time.
Unsurprisingly, a majority of the air quality at the Lighthouse 
Clinic and the Guardian Shelter falls at, or above, interim target 1. 
What is less expected is that even though there are fewer days of 
hazardous or very bad air quality at the other locations, most locations 
do not have target 4 values for even half of the time. Mercy James, the 
Malaria Project and Lions Sight have the largest percentages of days 
with air quality meeting the interim target 4, which is expected as 
these locations are further away from the main burning site. Interim 
target 2 rated air occupies an unexpectedly large proportion of the 
days at all locations, indicating that although there are a few very toxic, 
and a few quite good days, the majority of the air is actually neither, 
but still cause for concern.
3.3. “The air we breathe is not good”: 
perspectives from QECH
As the previous section has described, the open incineration of waste 
at QECH has created hazardous conditions for those occupying the space. 
These risks were not lost on staff and caregivers, as interviews 
demonstrated broad and near universal awareness of the poor air quality 
within the hospital grounds. Overwhelmingly, both caregivers and staff

were quick to decry the poor quality of the air, generally without 
prompting. The few exceptions were those staff posted on the peripheries 
of the hospital grounds, at a distance from the spaces of incineration. 
However, even those who did not experience the impacts of the burning, 
were aware of it, and considered themselves fortunate to be posted in a 
section of the hospital where it was less of a problem. Furthermore, 
according to caregivers and staff who work night shifts, air quality can 
be particularly bad at night and in the early morning, due to the habit of 
janitorial staff concentrating their burning during the late hours. The poor 
air quality on the hospital grounds is also a frequent cause for complaint 
by patients and visitors, with nearly every staff member interviewed being 
able to recall having received a complaint, and in turn, complaining to the 
administration. One of the staff8 members responsible for the burning 
said that he personally, had received hundreds of complaints, but was 
powerless to affect meaningful change, aside from burning at different 
hours, until the incinerator could be repaired.
Despite this consensus that the burning of waste within the hospital 
was affecting the air quality, significant differences emerged between 
respondents over their understandings of potential impacts, the 
effectiveness of various coping mechanisms, and their problematisations 
linked to the burning of specific waste materials. In addition, interviews 
revealed that these understandings were informed by a significant amount 
of misinformation, even amongst trained medical staff, which may

contribute to them being less able to mitigate potential risks for themselves 
and those who rely on their care.
3.3.1. Impacts, problematisations, and 
misinformation
The poor air quality within QECH was responsible, according to 
respondents, for a wide array of health impacts. The most common 
ones cited included: coughing and sneezing, sore throat, stinging eyes, 
breathing difficulties, and persistent cold and flu. Nausea was also 
mentioned, but was not a commonly described impact. Only one 
respondent9, of the 26 total interviewed, did not describe lingering 
health impacts which they could ascribe to the smoke, however, they 
also described having chronic eye irritation, but did not believe the 
smoke was a contributing factor.
In addition to these impacts, which respondents bear on a daily 
basis, many also believed that the smoke could contribute to a number 
of more serious, long-term health complications. For instance, nearly 
a quarter of respondents raised concerns of the potential impact that 
the smoke could have on patients or staff with asthma. Others flagged 
poor air quality as a potential risk factor for certain cancers, lung 
disease, or heart problems. For a few, the smoke posed an unknown 
danger: they were not sure what types of impacts it could have, but 
they were sure it was harmful in some way.

Also, understandably, given the large tuberculosis ward present 
within the hospital grounds, and the high prevalence of the disease 
within Malawi (13) there was significant concern (more than half of 
respondents) about the impact the poor air quality could have on 
those with the disease. However, there also persisted a belief among 
several respondents, including several nurses, that the smoke could 
be a cause of the disease itself. As one staff member10 stated, “I believe 
breathing this air for a long time can cause tuberculosis.” This, 
however, was only one of the few instances of misinformation which 
staff members held regarding air quality and health. Another 
example, voiced by several respondents, included a belief that some 
staff members were immune to the impacts of the smoke, because 
they had received vaccinations from the hospital. Nonetheless, they 
were concerned about the impacts of the smoke on patients and 
visitors, as one staff member (footnote 8) expressed:
Personally, I have never experienced [eye discomfort] because 
I get vaccinated and I am protected including other staff. However, 
we realise that the air can badly affect other people and patients 
who come to this place.
Another interesting misconception that emerged, which may 
be tied partly to translation and transcription, was a different 
10  ID8, 2019-11-20.
cultural understanding of smoke versus smells. More than half of 
the respondents appeared to conflate the two, with some 
expressing a belief that it was the odour of what was being burnt 
that was harmful, rather than the smoke being given off. This 
conflation led many to specifically problematise the burning of 
certain wastes, such as plastics, medicines, and other medical 
wastes, which give off distinctive or less pleasant odours, as 
opposed to the burning of other items, such as garden refuse, 
which may produce significant smoke, and contribute to higher 
recorded values of particulate matter, but produce a less pungent, 
or more normalised, odour.
3.3.2. Coping mechanisms
Finally, in order to manage the impacts of QECH’s persistently 
poor air quality, staff and visitors reported having developed a 
number of coping mechanisms, designed to help them get through 
their daily routines. These included staying indoors, blocking 
doors and windows, and taking breaks away from hospital 
grounds in order to catch some breaths of fresher air. However, for 
janitorial staff,11 inside was not necessarily better, as several 
reported that their indoor workspaces were insufferable for long 
periods of time from the smell of cleaning agents and other 
chemicals. Furthermore, amongst respondents there was a general

disagreement over the effectiveness of personal protective 
equipment (PPE), such as face masks, towards mitigating the 
impacts of the smoke. A few staff described pleading to hospital 
administration for such equipment, but to no avail. However, 
other staff members, who do have access to PPE, noted that even 
face masks do little to mitigate the impacts of the smoke, 
describing them as ineffective.
Most staff have been unable to find any way to mitigate the 
impacts of the smoke, and only found relief once they reached home 
at the end of their shift, as one of the janitorial staff described, “we 
only feel safe when we  are home.” Of course, this relief is not 
available for the hundreds of patients and caregivers who sleep at 
QECH or are unable to leave. Ultimately, most place their hope in 
the construction of the new incinerator (which had not yet been 
activated at the time of the interviews), and biding their time as 
construction drags on; coping as best they can. As the same member 
of the janitorial staff (footnote 11) described, “we are just hoping 
we will start breathing good air soon, when the new incinerator 
is opened.”
4. Conclusion
The air quality, as a result of open waste burning at Queen’s 
is poor and not suitable for a city, let alone a hospital. Over the 
course of this 2 month study, the hazardous limits for both PM 
parameters were exceeded at all locations except for the Lions 
Sight hospital. The WHO limits were exceeded fewer than 50 
times at five of the locations, and only the monitors at the 
Lighthouse Clinic and the Guardian Shelter recorded more than 
50 instances above the most hazardous limit. The results for the 
Lighthouse Clinic are directly related to the main trash burning 
site, while the worrisome air quality at the Guardian Shelter is 
primarily from near constant cooking with charcoal. Simple 
improvements to the cooking block (e.g., whirlybird vents) could 
at least vent the smoke above the roof and improve the air quality 
at human level. The composition of emissions recorded ranged 
significantly; the ratio PM10:PM2.5 likely reflects a range of 
burning styles and/or fuel (waste) type, and no discernible trend 
was observed. Among interview respondents, there was a general

consensus that the air quality caused by the burning of waste 
within the hospital was a problem, although there were significant 
differences between respondents over their understandings of 
potential impacts, the effectiveness of various coping 
mechanisms, and their problematisations linked to the burning 
of specific waste materials. For most, going home or leaving the 
Queen’s campus was the only pathway to relief, though for 
patients who cannot leave, endurance was the only option.
This work was originally planned as a before-and-after study: 
we envisioned reporting these baseline results compared to follow-up 
measurements once the long-promised incinerator was commissioned. 
However, nearly 4 years later, the incinerator is rarely functional 
(partly for technical reasons, partly for financial ones) and the smoke 
hovering over Queen’s is still thick. Waste management has long been 
known as an environmental health issue, but in the case of open trash 
burning at a medical facility, it becomes more: for some of the most 
vulnerable, especially those with tuberculosis, asthma or other chronic 
disease, it could be a matter of life or death.

Background: Waste disposal and management is a global concern affecting both high- and low-income countries. This research 
assessed the health impact of burning household waste in Khartoum State, Sudan.
Methods: An online community-based cross-sectional study was implemented on a sample of 844 participants selected through 
a stratified random sampling technique across Khartoum State. The data were collected through a standardized pre tested online 
questionnaire. The data file was georeferenced through Google Earth Pro and analysed with SPSS 23 and ArcGIS 10.3. The data were 
summarized numerically and graphically. The appropriate frequency tables were used in ArcGIS to generate geographical distribution 
maps of household waste burning and predictive health risk maps of waste burning in Khartoum State. Statistical tests performed for 
association carried out were Chi-square and ANOVA. A binary regression analysis established the relationship between burning of 
household waste and its associated factors. All statistical tests were considered significant when p < 0.05.
Results: The practice of burning household waste was performed by 74.5% (619/831) of the participants with 50.8% (311/612) who 
reported burning the waste weekly. The health conditions related to household waste burning were predominately asthma (57.0%) and 
respiratory manifestations (38.0%). Of the ten contributing factors of health risks related to burning household waste, the two 
statistically significant were the frequency of waste collection (OR = 0.720, 95% [CI: 0.593–0.875], p = 0.001) and the place of 
waste disposal (OR = 0.791, 95% [CI: 0.651–0.961], p = 0.018).
Conclusion: The practice of burning household waste in Khartoum State was a public health concern. Sociodemographic and 
managerial factors exposing residents to health risks appeal political, health authorities and communities to establish a partnership to 
manage household waste for public safety and good quality of life.
Keywords: burning waste, health risk, household waste, municipality waste collectors, open discharge, waste collection
Introduction
Waste management is a global concern affecting high- and low-income countries and its inappropriate handling can 
drastically impact human health. Waste disposal methods range from causally dumping on the streets to efficiently 
engineered waste disposal schemes including burying and burning.1 The last one has been reported to increase in 
forthcoming years, leading to the degradation of the quality of air due to chemical atmospheric organic aerosols and 
a large number of compounds with carcinogenic and mutagenic potencies emitted in the atmosphere.2,3 The practice of 
household waste burning, widely common in developing countries, is directly linked to the availability of waste 
collection services and the frequencies of waste collection regardless of the setting (urban, periurban and rural) and 
the quantity of waste generated.4 Residents living close to waste burning sites are exposed to health hazards, such as 
cancers and psychological disturbances due to the burn fumes. Their quality of life is hindered when the burning is

frequent and particularly when the waste is mixed with hazardous medical and industrial waste. This leads to a life- 
threatening relationship between air pollution, open burning and poor community health in particular where population 
density is high and the frequency of waste collection is low.5,6
Vast amount of environmental pollution is related to improper recycling, in particular with the most complex and the fastest 
growing municipal waste streams, which is electronic waste. Both formal and informal sectors are involved in management of 
municipal waste. These sectors employ waste pickers who target plastic and metal waste, which they attempt to recycle and 
sell to manufacturers. This practice is observed in high- and low-income countries but more evident in low incomes due to 
economic crises. The waste workers, either in formal or informal sectors, had high odds of experiencing fatigue, headaches, 
insomnia, gastrointestinal manifestations, including nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. Being exposed was also significantly 
associated with respiratory symptoms, which include dyspnea, sneezing, dry cough, sputum and rhinorrhea.7–10
Khartoum State, hosting the capital city of Sudan, is the home of an estimated total population of 7,351,331 people as 
of 2022. This population generated daily 5100 tons of garbage of which only 3570 tons were disposed per day in three 
landfills, which namely are Tayba, Hatab and Aby Wlidat. The remaining 1530 tons of garbage were daily left at the 
points of generation and in the streets.11–13
Generally, a greater number of people are aware that disease transmission is related to improper management of 
waste; however, most of them ignore that improper management of waste can also impact the environment because of the 
production of greenhouse gases.14,15 In this framework, this research aimed to contribute in assessing the health impact of 
household waste burning in Khartoum State as at 2022.
Methods
An online community-based descriptive cross-sectional study was implemented from 10–26 April 2022. The study was 
conducted in Khartoum State subdivided in seven localities with a total population of 7,351,331 people distributed in 
871,142 households of which 80.0% are urban and 20.0% rural. Of the total population of Sudan of 46,162,459 people, 
the Digital 2022 Global Overview Report published that 35.76 million cellular mobile connections in Sudan at start of 
2022. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Firstly, all the seven localities were 
included in the study. At second level, a stratified random sampling was used to distribute the households proportionally 
to size of each locality in using the formula n=N/1+Nd2 where n was the estimated number of households in a given 
locality, N was the total households in the locality under consideration, and d was the degree of accuracy set at 0.05. This 
led to an estimated 2791 households to be included in the study, however, because of time constraint related to the 
deadline of the submission of our required MBBS thesis, the estimated sample size was adjusted by dividing it by three 
resulting to a targeted 930 households. Under the assumption, that in each of household, at least one member might have 
a smartphone, the sample size was estimated to be 930 participants. Of the 930 participants targeted, the study covered 
844 participants representing 90.8% of the study targeted population. The data collected included the characteristics of 
the study participants (area of residence, type of residence, gender, age, marital status, occupation, education level, and 
household size), the types of waste management, the perceived health problems reported by the participants, the 
awareness of participants towards the risks related to household waste. The data collected through online google 
forms in Arabic were firstly converted in MS Excel and uploaded in the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS 
23). The obtained SPSS data file was then translated in English and was geo-referenced by adding the geolocation 
(latitude and longitude) of the residence of the participants. The geographical coordinates were obtained through Google 
Earth Pro 7.3.6.9345 (64-bit). The geo-referenced data file was summarized numerically (mean, standard deviation and 
median). Their graphical summary enabled to generate frequency tables, which were used in the geographical informa­
tion system (ArcGIS 10.3 for desktop version 10.3.043322) to generate geographical distribution and risk maps of 
household waste burning and its related health problems. The predictive risk map of burning household waste was 
elaborated by using the kriging method of data interpolation. A method based on the semivariogram, which captures the 
spatial dependence between samples by plotting the semi variance against the separation distance. The premise of any 
spatial interpolation is that close samples tend to be more similar than distant samples (this is also called spatial 
autocorrelation). This property of spatial data is implicitly used in inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation to 
determine cell values using a linearly weighted combination of a set of sample points. IDW is a method of interpolation

that estimates cell values by averaging the values of sample data points in the neighborhood of each processing cell. The 
closer a point is to the center of the cell being estimated, the more influence, or weight it has in the averaging process. 
The weight is a function of inverse distance. The surface being interpolated should be that of a location dependent 
variable. In kriging, one must model the spatial autocorrelation using a semivariogram instead of assuming a direct, 
linear relationship with separation distance.16,17 Association between variables was also determined though Chi-square 
tests and analysis of variance. A binary regression analysis established the relationship between health impact of burning 
household waste and its associated factors. All the statistical tests were considered significant when p-value <0.05.
Results
Characteristics of the Participants
All the participants (n = 844) provided electronically their informed consent; they were 97.2% (792/815) aged between 
18 years and 81 years and 2.8% (23/815) aged 14–17 years. During the data cleaning, this last age group was not 
excluded (14 years (n = 1, 0.1%), 15 years (n = 3, 0.4%), 16 years (n = 4, 0.5%) and 17 years (n = 15, 1.8%)). Under the 
assumption that if ≤17 years were able to participate the reason was that they are social media users and without parental 
approval they cannot own an electronic device (smartphone, iPhone, laptop) given the cost of this device in Sudan. The 
participants were from six of the seven localities of Khartoum State with 55.9% (463/829) living in Khartoum locality 
(Figure 1). 59.1% were females and 40.0% were males. They were aged 14–81 years with a median age of 23 years and 
55.3% were 14–24 years old. Their family size ranged from 1 to 28 members with an average of 6 people, 61.5% of the 
participants (n = 811) reported living in families of 1–6 people. Table 1 displays the marital status, the education level 
and the status of ownership of the living place of the participants.

Household Waste Management in Khartoum State
Daily Quantity of Waste Produced and Its Disposal
The quantity of household waste produced daily was reported by 57.3% (479/836) of the participants out of which 20.1% 
(168/836) daily produced <500 g, 37.2% (311/836) generated ≥1000 g and 42.7% (357/838) could not quantify their 
daily household waste. For those who reported the daily quantity of household waste, their household size varied from 5 
members to 7 members with a statistically significant association (F2, 801= 17.324, p= 0.000) between quantity of waste 
daily produced and the household size. The household waste produced was disposed in the neighborhood common 
discharge (42.5%, 345/812), outside the house till removed by waste collectors (39.8%, 323/812), 11.6% (94/1812) 
discharged their waste both outside the house and in the common discharge and 6.2% (50/812) disposed in other places.
Collection of Household Waste Disposed in the Neighborhoods
The participants (n = 835) reported that in their neighborhood the household waste was collected by the municipality (44.6%), by 
caro (cart pulled by donkey, 10.9%), or left in the common discharge of the neighborhood (28.5%). 16.0% of the participants 
provided a combined removal of household waste involving municipality waste collectors, caro and left in common discharge.
More than half (55.7%, 461/827) of the participants reported irregular collection of household waste from their 
neighborhoods and they were 14.4% (119/827) who declared that the waste produced was never collected with 
a statistically significant association (Pearson Chi-Square=246.76, p=0.000) between the responsible of waste collection 
and the frequency of the collection.
Practice of Household Waste Burning and Perceived Health Hazards
Of 831 participants, 74.5% reported that in their neighborhood people burnt household waste with 50.8% (311/612) who 
declared that this practice occurred weekly. They were 25.5% (212/831) who did not have this practice in their 
neighborhood. Figure 2 displays the details of the opinions of the participants towards burning household waste.
The health risk related to the technique of burning household waste was assessed through a three level-scale (least 
harmful, may be harmful and most harmful) and compared to two other waste management techniques (collecting and 
burying household waste). The majority of participants (74.7%, 590/790) reported that burning waste was the most 
harmful risk for health. They were 55.3% (457/826) who lived in neighborhoods with burning waste places located in 
a radius ≤500 m from their individual residences. The majority of the participants (86.5%, 715/827) perceived burning 
household waste even at a distance of >500 m represented also a health risk. At the time of the data collection, the

participants were suffering from asthma (57.0%, 409.718), respiratory disease (38.0%, 273/718), ocular disease (2.2%, 
16/718), headaches (1.4%, 10/718), skin lesions (1.1%,8/718), musculoskeletal pain (0/1%,1/781) and sleeping distur­
bance (0.1%, 1/718) which they associated to household waste burning.
Community Engagement in Household Waste Management
Most of the participants (85.6%) indicated that the responsibility of the collection of household waste in the neighbor­
hoods engaged both the municipality and the households, 11.6% held the municipality as responsible (Table 2). At the 
time of the data collection, more than half of the participants (65,7%, 506/770) paid their contribution to the municipality, 
whereas 22.9% (176/770) paid private waste collectors to remove their household waste. However, only 40.3% (323/810) 
were willing to increase their financial contribution, for various reasons, 59.7% would not increase it if requested to do so 
as revealed by Table 2.
Relationship Between Burning Household Waste and Its Associate Factors
The Figures 3 and 4 reveal that burning household waste was a practice across six of the seven localities of Khartoum State.
A binary logistic regression analysis identified ten factors contributing to burning household waste in Khartoum State. 
These factors were gender, age, marital status, education level, household size, quantity of waste produced, place of 
waste disposal, person disposing the waste, responsible of collection of the waste and frequency of waste collection. The 
two statistically significant factors explaining the burning household waste were the frequency of waste collection (OR = 
0.720, 95% [CI: 0.593–0.875], p = 0.001) and the place of waste disposal (OR = 0.791, 95% [CI: 0.651–0.961], p = 
0.018). The negative coefficient of −0.328 of the frequency of waste collection indicated the household waste in 
neighborhoods was more likely to be burnt when the collection was “irregular”. The place of waste disposal had 
a negative coefficient of −0.235, which pointed out that burning of household waste happened more often when the place 
of discharge was the neighborhood discharge. Marital status (OR = 1.380, 95% [CI: 0.870–2.188], p = 0.171), 
responsible of the collection of house waste (OR = 1.165, 95% [CI: 0.982–1.381], p = 0.081) and the household size 
(OR = 1.027, 95% [CI: 0.967–1.090], p = 0.385) were contributing factors for ≥1 time. Table 3 reveals five contributing 
factors to the burning of household waste, each with a negative coefficient indicating an inverse. The coefficient of age of 
−0.020 indicated that younger participants were more kin to burn household waste, whereas the coefficient of the quantity 
of waste daily produced of −0.071 pointed out that when the household disposed daily <500 g of waste, the higher was

the likelihood that the waste discharged would be burned. The education level had a coefficient of −0.092 stressing that 
the participants with Quranic or primary school education were more prone to burn household waste. The coefficient of 
−0.128 of the person disposing waste suggested that the household waste would likely be burnt if it disposed by 
a household member (husband, spouse or children). Male gender was more keen to burn household waste with 
a coefficient of −0.258.
Estimated Population at Risk of Health Hazards Related to Burning Household Waste 
in Khartoum State
Table 4 reveals that the proportion of burning household waste varied from 64.3% (Sharg En Nile locality) to 86.5% 
(Omdurman locality) with median of 74.6%. Overall, of the total population 6,804,608 people distributed in the six 
localities surveyed, 5,046,899 persons were exposed to the health risk related to household waste burning. The predictive 
risk map (Figure 5) revealed that all the seven localities of Khartoum State were exposed to health risk related to burning 
household waste. The risk map revealed a very high risk belt (80.4–82.4%) localized in the western part of Karary 
locality with an extension in Omdurman. The lowest risk of 64.3–67.0% covered the eastern part of Sharg En Nile 
locality.
Discussion
In their study, Addo et al18 reported a daily household waste production of 2000 g of which 36.6% was organic waste, 
34.4% inorganic and 29.0% was combined organic and inorganic waste, while Fadhullah et al15 indicated that 74.3% of 
household waste were food debris and 18.3% were plastic materials. This research performed online failed to identify the 
composition of household waste, nonetheless 57.3% knew the daily quantity of waste generated by their households 
which was <500 g as reported by 20.1% of the participants and ≥1000 g for 37.2% of the interviewees. The normally 
distributed household size was statistically associated (F2,801= 17.324, p= 0.000) with the daily quantity of household 
waste generated which according to Elsarraf et al13 in Khartoum State, residential solid waste was composed of food 
waste, paper, cardboard, plastic, textile, leather, yard waste, wood, glass, metals and ashes.

The findings of this research revealed 28.5% of the household waste was left in common discharge. Regarding the 
frequencies of the collection of household waste, more than half (55.7%) of the participants (n = 827) reported that the 
waste was collected in their neighborhood irregularly. The household waste removed periodically for 29.9% and never 
for 14.4% with a statistically significant association between frequency of household collection and responsible of waste 
collection. We assumed that the municipality waste collection offices might lack a monitoring system, adequate human 
and logistic resources to track all the common waste discharges across the state for timely removal and safe disposal of 
the waste in three designated landfills which totalized a capacity of 4,391,000 m3 out of which only 24.0% are used.13
The majority (74.5%) of this study participants practiced household waste burning and 74.7% of them revealed that 
burning waste was the most harmful risk for health. The health risk they indicated by order of frequency were asthma, 
respiratory, ocular disease, headaches, skin lesions, musculoskeletal pain and sleeping disturbance. This study failed to 
identify the pollutants related waste burning, but in the literature authors published14,19,20 as health risk related to waste 
burning potential irritant to skin, eyes and respiratory tract, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, fatigue (OR = 22.48; 95% 
[CI: 9.34–54.09]), headaches (OR = 16.88; 95% [CI:7.85–36.31]), insomnia (OR = 10.64; 95% [CI: 3.09–36.67]), nausea

(OR = 9.57; 95% [CI: 4.03–22.70]), sputum (OR = 8.79; 95% [CI: 3.23–23.94]), and rhinorrhea (OR = 6.00; 95% [CI: 
2.48–14.56]). Two statistically significant factors explained the burning of household waste in Khartoum State, the 
frequency of waste collection (OR = 0.720, 95% [CI: 0.593–0.875], p = 0.001) and the place of waste disposal (OR = 
0.791, 95% [CI: 0.651–0.961], p= 0.018) with, respectively, negative coefficients (βs) of, respectively, −0.328 and −0.235 
indicating when the frequency of the collection of the waste was irregular and the venue of disposable was in the 
neighborhood central point of waste collection the higher the probabilities that the household waste would be burned. 
Marital status (OR = 1.380, 95% [CI: 0.870–2.188], p = 0.171) was a contributing factor for burning household and it 
could be due to the higher generation of waste by the participants who were ever married (including widowed and 
divorced) than the singles who represented 61.8% of the study population as confirmed by its coefficient of contribution 
of 0.322. Another contributing factor of burning household waste was the household size (OR = 1.027, 95% [CI: 0.967– 
1.090], p= 0.385) as the higher the number of household members, the higher the quantity of household waste generated. 
The contribution of the person responsible of collection of waste (OR = 1.165, 95% [CI: 0.982–1.381], p = 0.081) could 
be explained when it was family members (husband, wife and children) rather than maids and other household residents. 
Other contributing factors were the age of participants, the quantity of waste daily produced the education level and the 
person disposing the waste. Elsewhere in the literature, a multiple logistic regression revealed that female gender (AOR = 
0.45; 95% [Cl: 0.29, 0.79]), household size (AOR = 0.26; 95% [Cl: 0.09, 0.77]), practice of recycling (AOR = 0.03; 95% 
[Cl: 0.02, 0.08]) were contributing factors of waste management practice.15
The use of a geographic information system (GIS) to estimate human exposure to a variety of agents was published already 
by Fazzo et al21 It emerged from the GIS analysis in this study that the health risks related to burning household waste 
concerned all the seven localities of Khartoum State with a very high risk belt (risk scale: 80.4–82.4%) localized in the western 
part of Karary locality extended downward in Omdurman. In the eastern part of the state, the locality of Sharg En Nile fell in 
the low risk belt of 64.3–67.0%. These risk areas might be explained by the satellite imagery (Supplement 1) revealing that the 
landscape tends to be more arid while moving from the eastern of the state (Sharg En Nile) to the north western part (Karary), 
hence the vegetation becomes rare and exposed to winds blows due to the absence of trees as discussed by Tahir et al.22

Some limitations of this research should be discussed. The types household waste managed was recorded; hence, the 
loss of ability to identify and quantify the biochemical risk for health related to the burning. Another limitation was the 
inability to estimate the daily production of household waste as this parameter was recorded as a categorical variable. This 
limited the possibility to correlate the quantity produced and the household size. The research failed to digitize the location 
of household waste discharge in each of the neighborhoods covered consequently the distance between the residence and 
the discharge place could not be estimated either through SPSS or ArcGIS. This limitation should be addressed in future 
studies. Nonetheless, these limitations were minimized by the binary logistic regression which enabled firstly to assess the 
validity and reliability of the online data collection with an overall representativeness of 74.9%.
Conclusion
The practice of burning household waste was common in this study exposing the participants to asthma, respiratory 
disease, ocular disease, headaches, skin lesions, musculoskeletal pain and sleeping disturbance. The identified factors 
associated to burning of household waste could be packaged in two groups socio-demographic (age, gender, marital 
status, education level, household size) and managerial (quantity of waste generated, person disposing the waste, 
frequency and body of removal of the waste) factors. This appeal the political and health authorities and the communities 
of Khartoum State to establish a win-win collaboration to manage household waste across the state to ensure public 
safety and good quality of life to all the residents of state.
Ethical Considerations
The research proposal was submitted to and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Faculty of 
Medicine of the University of Medical Science and Technology. The research was implemented as an online community- 
based survey, which did not require ethical approval from Khartoum State Ministry of Health. The research proposal 
reviewed by UMST Institutional Review Board included the research questionnaire which access required to an 
electronic signature to obtain the informed consent of each participant. Those who checked no were automatically 
denied access to the research tool. The UMST IRB was aware that in the socio-cultural environment of Sudan household 
management can be undertaken also by participants under ≤17 years. The graduation panel which reviewed the thesis 
(awarded the first price of the Faculty of Medicine) from which the current submitted manuscript endorsed the inclusion 
of 2.8% (23/815) of the participants aged 14–17 years. The confidentiality of the participants was ensured by the use of 
an anonymous questionnaire. The participants were also informed on the right to withdraw from the search at any time 
they might wish and they were free not to address a question they did not feel to do so.
